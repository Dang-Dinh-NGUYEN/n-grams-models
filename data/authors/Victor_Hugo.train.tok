<s> <s> charles myriel , in spite of this marriage ( so people said ) , had been the cause of much tattle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was well built , though of short stature , elegant , graceful , and witty; and the earlier part of his life was devoted to the world and to gallantry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> did the overthrow of the old french society , the fall of his own family , and the tragic spectacles of ' 93 , more frightful perhaps to the emigrs who saw them from a distance with the magnifying power of terror , cause ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was he , in the midst of one of the distractions and affections which occupied his life , suddenly assailed by one of those mysterious and terrible blows which often prostrate , by striking at his heart , a man whom public catastrophes could not overthrow by attacking him in his existence and his fortune? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one could have answered these questions; all that was known was that when he returned from italy he was a priest . </s> </s>

<s> <s> whatever they might be , after ten years of episcopacy and residence at d , all this gossip , which at the outset affords matter of conversation for little towns and little people , had fallen into deep oblivion . </s> </s>

<s> <s> baptistine was a tall , pale , slim , gentle person; she realized the ideal of what the word  - respectable -  expresses , for it seems necessary for a woman to be a mother in order to be venerable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what had been thinness in her youth had become in her maturity transparency , and through this transparency the angel could be seen . </s> </s>

<s> <s> myriel was installed in his episcopal palace with all the honors allotted by the imperial decrees which classify the bishop immediately after a major - general . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mayor and the president paid him the first visit , and he on his side paid the first visit to the general and the prefect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the installation was ended the town waited to see its bishop at work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a spacious , handsome mansion , built at the beginning of the last century by monseigneur henri puget , doctor in theology of the faculty of paris , and abb of simore , who was bishop of d in 1712 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated the dining - room , and the memorable date , july 29 , 1714 , was engraved in golden letters on a white marble tablet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hospital was a small , single - storeyed house with a little garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three days after his arrival the bishop visited it , and when his visit was over asked the director to be kind enough to come to his house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how many patients have you at this moment?  -  he asked . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - the number i counted , -  said the bishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the beds are very close together , -  the director continued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i noticed it . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - the wards are only bed - rooms , and difficult to ventilate . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i thought so . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - and then , when the sun shines , the garden is very small for the convalescents . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i said so to myself . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s>  - what would you have , monseigneur!  -  the director said ,  - we must put up with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop was silent for a moment , and then turned smartly to the director . </s> </s>

<s> <s> one day , when he had been at d about three months , the bishop said ,<s> <s>  - for all that , i am dreadfully pressed . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - true , -  said the bishop ,  - you are right , madame magloire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he made his claim , and shortly after the council - general , taking the demand into consideration , voted him the annual sum of 3000 francs , under the heading ,  - allowance to the bishop for maintenance of carriage , posting charges , and outlay in visitations . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> this caused an uproar among the cits of the town , and on this occasion a senator of the empire , ex - member of the council of the five hundred , favourable to the 18th brumaire , and holding a magnificent appointment near d , wrote to the minister of worship , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bigot de prameneu , a short , angry , and confidential letter , from which we extract these authentic lines: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - maintenance of carriage! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first place , what is the good of visitations at all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , secondly , how can he travel post in this mountainous country , where there are no roads , and people must travel on horseback? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this one played the good apostle when he arrived , but now he is like the rest , and must have his carriage and post - chaise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wishes to be as luxurious as the old bishops . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my lord , matters will never go on well till the emperor has delivered us from the skullcaps . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> the affair , on the other hand , greatly gladdened madame magloire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , -  she said to mlle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistine ,  - monseigneur began with others , but he was obliged to finish with himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has regulated all his charities , and here are 3000 francs for us at last!  - <s> <s> the same evening the bishop wrote , and gave his sister , a note conceived thus: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> carriage and travelling expenses . </s> </s>

<s> <s> in a short time the monetary offerings became augmented . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the bishop in less than a year became the treasurer of all charity and the cashier of all distress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at such times he stripped himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it being the custom for the bishops to place their christian names at the head of their mandates and pastoral letters , the poor people of the country had selected the one among them which conveyed a meaning , and called him monseigneur welcome ( bienvenu ) . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will do like them , and call him so when occasion serves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i like that name , -  he would say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the welcome corrects the monseigneur . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> we do not assert that the portrait we are here drawing is probably as far as fiction goes: we confine ourselves to saying that it bears a likeness to the reality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the diocese of d is fatiguing; there are few plains and many mountains , and hardly any roads , as we saw just now: twenty - two curacies , forty - one vicarages , and two hundred and eighty - five chapels of ease . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two old females generally accompanied him , but when the journey was too wearying for them he went alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mayor of the city came to receive him at the door of the bishop' s palace , and saw him dismount with scandalized eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few cits were laughing round him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mayor and gentlemen , -  the bishop said ,  - i see what it is that scandalizes you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you consider it great pride for a poor priest to ride an animal which our saviour once upon a time bestrode . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did so through necessity , i assure you , and not through vanity . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> on his tours the bishop was indulgent and gentle , and preached less than he conversed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his reasonings and models were never far - fetched , and to the inhabitants of one country he quoted the example of an adjacent country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in those cantons where people were harsh to the needy he would say ,  - look at the people of brianon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have given the indigent , the widows , and the orphans , the right of mowing their fields three days before all the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they rebuild their houses gratuitously when they are in ruins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hence it is a country blessed of god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if a father of a family at harvest - time has his sons in the army , his daughters serving in the town , or if he be ill or prevented from toil , the cur recommends him in his sermon; and on sunday after mass all the villagers , men , women , and children , go into his field , and cut and carry home his crop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  to families divided by questions of money or inheritance he said ,  - look at the highlanders of devolny , a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard once in fifty years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , when the father of a family dies there the boys go off to seek their fortune , and leave the property to the girls , so that they may obtain husbands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  in those parts where the farmers are fond of lawsuits , and ruin themselves in writs , he would say ,  - look at those good peasants of the valley of queyras . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are three thousand souls there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , it is like a little republic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> neither judge nor bailiff is known there , and the mayor does everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he divides the imposts , taxes everybody conscientiously , settles quarrels gratis , allots patrimonies without fees , gives sentences without costs , and is obeyed because he is a just man among simple men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know what they do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as a small place , containing only twelve or fifteen hearths , cannot always support a master , they have schoolmasters paid by the whole valley , who go from village to village , spending a week in one , ten days in another , and teaching . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they can be recognized by the pens they carry in their hat - band . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those who only teach reading have but one pen: those who teach reading and arithmetic have two: those who teach reading , arithmetic , and latin , have three . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do like the people of queyras . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he spoke thus , gravely and paternally . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when examples failed him he invented parables , going straight to the point , with few phrases and a good deal of imagery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his was the eloquence of the apostles , convincing and persuading . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop' s conversation was affable and lively . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he condescended to the level of the two old females who spent their life near him , and when he laughed it was a schoolboy' s laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame magloire was fond of calling him  - your grandeur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  one day he rose from his easy chair and went to fetch a book from his library: as it was on one of the top shelves , and as the bishop was short , he could not reach it  - madame magloire , -  he said ,  - bring me a chair , for my grandeur does not rise to that shelf . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> one of his distant relatives , the countess de l , rarely let an opportunity slip to enumerate in his presence what she called the  - hopes -  of her three sons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had several very old relatives close to death' s door , of whom her sons were the natural heirs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop generally listened in silence to this innocent and pardonable maternal display . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  she broke off somewhat impatiently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> augustine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> place your hopes in the man to whom it is impossible to succeed . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> on another occasion , receiving a letter announcing the death of a country gentleman , in which , in addition to the dignities of the defunct , all the feudal and noble titles of all his relatives were recorded , - what a back death has! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what an admirable burthen of titles he is made lightly to bear , -  he exclaimed ,  - and what sense men must possess thus to employ the tomb in satisfying their vanity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his whole life - time m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were six of them to share it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day the bishop saw him bestowing his charity , and said to his sister , with a smile ,  - look at m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gborand buying heaven for a sou . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> when it was a question of charity he would not let himself be rebuffed even by a refusal , and at such times made remarks which caused people to reflect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once he was collecting for the poor in a drawing - room of the town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the marquis de champtercier was present , a rich old avaricious man , who contrived to be at once ultra - royalist and ultra - voltairian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this variety has existed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop on reaching him touched his arm ,  - monsieur le marquis , you must give me something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day he delivered the following sermon at the cathedral: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my very dear brethren , my good friends , there are in france thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants'  houses which have only three openings; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand which have only two openings , the door and the window; and , lastly , three hundred and forty - six thousand cabins which have only one opening , the door , and this is because of a thing called the door and window tax . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god gives men fresh air , and the law sells it to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not accuse the law , but i bless god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the isre , in the var , in the two alps , upper and lower , the peasants have not even trucks , but carry manure on their backs: they have no candles , and burn resinous logs and pieces of rope steeped in pitch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is the same through all the high parts of dauphin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in winter they break this bread with axes and steep it in water for four - and - twenty hours before they can eat it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brethren , have pity , see how people suffer around you!  - <s> <s> a provenal by birth , he easily accustomed himself to all the dialects of the south: this greatly pleased the people , and had done no little in securing him admission to all minds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was , as it were , at home in the hut and on the mountain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could say the grandest things in the most vulgar idioms , and as he spoke all languages he entered all hearts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , he was the same to people of fashion as to the lower classes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he never condemned anything hastily or without taking the circumstances into calculation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> being , as he called himself with a smile , an ex - sinner , he had none of the intrenchments of rigorism , and , careless of the frowns of the unco'  good , professed loudly a doctrine which might be summed up nearly as follows ,<s> <s>  - man has upon him the flesh which is at once his burden and his temptation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he carries it with him and yields to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he must watch , restrain , and repress it , and only obey it in the last extremity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this obedience there may still be a fault: but the fault thus committed is venial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a fall , but a fall on the knees , which may end in prayer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> err , fail , sin , but be just . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the least possible amount of sin is the law of man: no sin at all is the dream of angels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that is earthly is subjected to sin , for sin is a gravitation . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> when he saw everybody cry out and grow indignant , all of a sudden , he would say with a smile ,  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , it seems as if this is a great crime which all the world is committing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look at the startled hypocrites , hastening to protest and place themselves under cover . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would say ,  - the faults of women , children , servants , the weak , the indigent , and the ignorant are the fault of husbands , fathers , masters , the strong , the rich , and the learned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he also said ,  - teach the ignorant as much as you possibly can: society is culpable for not giving instruction gratis , and is responsible for the night it produces . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> as we see , he had a strange manner , peculiarly his own , of judging things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i suspect that he obtained it from the gospels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he one day heard in a drawing - room the story of a trial which was shortly to take place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woman was arrested while issuing the first false piece manufactured by the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was detained , but there was no proof against her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she denied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they pressed her , but she adhered to her denial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , exasperated by jealousy , she denounced her lover , confessed everything , proved everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the story was told , and everybody was delighted at the magistrate' s cleverness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by bringing jealousy into play he brought out the truth through passion , and obtained justice through revenge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop listened to all this in silence , and when it was ended he asked:  - where will this man and woman be tried?  -   - at the assizes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man was condemned to death for murder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the trial attracted the attention of the towns - people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the eve of the day fixed for the execution the prison chaplain was taken ill , and a priest was wanted to assist the sufferer in his last moments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cur was sent for , and it seems that he refused , saying ,  - it is no business of mine , i have nothing to do with the mountebank , i am ill too , and besides , that is not my place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he spent the whole day with him , forgetting sleep and food while praying to god for the soul of the condemned man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he told him the best truths , which are the most simple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was father , brother , friendbishop only to bless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he taught him everything , while reassuring and consoling him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man was about to die in desperation: death was to him like an abyss , and he shuddered as he stood on its gloomy brink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was not ignorant enough to be completely indifferent , and his condemnation , which was a profound shock , had here and there broken through that partition which separates us from the mystery of things , and which we call life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he peered incessantly out of this world through these crevices , and only saw darkness; but the bishop showed him a light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the morrow , when they came to fetch the condemned man , the bishop was with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he followed him , and showed himself to the mob in his purple cassock , and with the episcopal cross round his neck , side by side with this rope - bound wretch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he entered the cart with him , he mounted the scaffold with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop embraced him , and at the moment when the knife was about to fall , said:  - the man whom his fellow - men kill , god resuscitates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he whom his brothers expel finds the father again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray , believe , enter into life! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the father is there!  -  when he descended from the scaffold there was something in his glance which made the people open a path for him; it was impossible to say whether his pallor or his serenity were the more admirable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on returning to the humble abode , which he called smilingly his palace , he said to his sister:  - i have just been officiating pontifically . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> as the most sublime things are often those least understood , there were persons in the town who said , in commenting on the bishop' s conduct ,  - it is affectation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  this , however , was only the talk of drawing - rooms; the people who do not regard holy actions with suspicion were affected , and admired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the bishop , the sight of the guillotine was a shock to him , and it was long ere he recovered from it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we may feel a certain amount of indifference about the punishment of death , not express an opinion , and say yes or no , so long as we have never seen a guillotine; but when we have come across one the shock is violent , and we must decide either for or against . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the social questions raise their notes of interrogation round this cutter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the scaffold is a vision , it is not carpenter' s work , it is not a machine , it is not a lifeless mechanism made of wood , steel , and ropes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seems to be a species of being possessing a gloomy intuition; you might say that the wood - work lives , that the machine hears , that the mechanism understands , that the wood , the steel , and the ropes , have a volition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours , it eats flesh and drinks blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he who usually returned from all his duties with such radiant satisfaction seemed to be reproaching himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at times he soliloquized , and stammered unconnected sentences in a low voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here is one which his sister overheard and treasured up:  - i did not believe that it was so monstrous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is wrong to absorb oneself in the divine law so greatly as no longer to perceive the human law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> death belongs to god alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by what right do men touch that unknown thing?  - <s> <s> with time these impressions were attenuated , and perhaps effaced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still it was noticed that from this period the bishop avoided crossing the execution square . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> myriel might be called at any hour to the bedside of the sick and the dying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was not ignorant that his greatest duty and greatest labor lay there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> widowed or orphaned families had no occasion to send for him , for he came of himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had the art of sitting down and holding his tongue for hours by the side of a man who had lost the wife he loved , or of a mother bereaved of her child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what an admirable consoler he was! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not try to efface grief by oblivion , but to aggrandize and dignify it by hope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would say:  - take care of the way in which you turn to the dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not think of that which perishes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look fixedly , and you will perceive the living light of your beloved dead in heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he knew that belief is healthy , and he sought to counsel and calm the desperate man by pointing out to him the resigned man , and to transform the grief that gazes at a grave by showing it the grief that looks at a star . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to any one who could inspect it closely , the voluntary poverty in which the bishop lived would have been a solemn and charming spectacle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the morning he remained in contemplation for an hour , and then read mass either at the cathedral or in his house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mass over , he breakfasted on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he set to work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has congregations to control , permissions to grant , a whole ecclesiastical library to examine , in the shape of diocesan catechisms , books of hours , etc . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the time which these thousand tasks , his offices , and his breviary left him , he gave first to the needy , the sick , and the afflicted; the time which the afflicted , the sick , and the needy left him he gave to work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes he hoed in his garden , at others he read and wrote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the mind is a garden , -  he would say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> toward mid - day , when the weather was fine , he went out and walked in the country or the town , frequently entering the cottages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now and then he stopped , spoke to the little boys and girls , and smiled on their mothers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he visited the poor so long as he had any money; when he had none he visited the rich . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he made his cassocks last a long time , and he did not wish the fact to be noticed , he never went into town save in his wadded violet coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was rather tiresome in summer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on returning home he dined . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dinner resembled the breakfast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at half - past eight in the evening he supped with his sister , madame magloire standing behind them and waiting on them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing could be more frugal than this meal; but if the bishop had a cur to supper , madame magloire would take advantage of it to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake , or famous game from the mountain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was well read , and a bit of a savant , and has left five or six curious mss . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on theological subjects , among others a dissertation on the verse from genesis ,  - in the beginning the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  in another dissertation he examines the works of hugo , bishop of ptolemas , great - grand - uncle of him who writes this book , and he proves that to this bishop must be attributed the various opuscules published in the last century under the pseudonym of barleycourt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at times , in the midst of his reading , no matter what book he held in his hands , he would suddenly fall into a deep meditation , from which he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the book . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these lines have frequently no connection with the book that contains them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have before us a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled ,  - correspondence of lord germain with generals clinton and cornwallis , and the admirals of the american station . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ecclesiastes calls you omnipotence; the maccabees call you creator; the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty; baruch calls you immensity; the psalms call you wisdom and truth; st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here it is necessary that we should give an exact idea of the bishop' s residence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the house the bishop resided in consisted , as we have said , of a ground floor and one above it , three rooms on the ground , three bed - rooms on the first floor , and above them a store - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of the oratory was a closed alcove with a bed , for any one who stayed the night , and the bishop offered this bed to country curs whom business or the calls of their parish brought to d . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hospital surgery , a small building added to the house and built on a part of the garden , had been transformed into kitchen and cellar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was also in the garden a stable , which had been the old hospital kitchen , and in which the bishop kept two cows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whatever the quantity of milk they yielded , he invariably sent one half every morning to the hospital patients . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am paying my tithes , -  he was wont to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his room was rather spacious , and very difficult to heat in the cold weather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as wood is excessively dear at d , he hit on the idea of partitioning off with planks a portion of the cow - house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here he spent his evenings during the great frosts , and called it his  - winter drawing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  in this room , as in the dining - room , there was no other furniture but a square deal table and four straw chairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop had made the altar which decorated his oratory out of a similar buffet , suitably covered with white cloths and imitation lace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his rich penitents and the religious ladies of d had often subscribed to pay for a handsome new altar for monseigneur' s oratory; each time he took the money and gave it to the poor . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> there were in his oratory two straw priedieus , and an arm - chair , also of straw , in his bed - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he by chance received seven or eight persons at the same time , the prefect , the general , the staff of the regiment quartered in the town , or some pupils of the lower seminary , it was necessary to fetch the chairs from the winter drawing - room , the priedieus from the oratory , and the easy chair from the bed - room: in this way as many as eleven seats could be collected for the visitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened at times that there would be twelve; in such a case the bishop concealed the embarrassing nature of the situation by standing before the chimney if it were winter , or walking up and down the room were it summer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was also another chair in the alcove , but it was half robbed of the straw , and had only three legs to stand on , so that it could only be used when resting against a wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mlle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistine also had in her bed - room a very large settee of wood , which had once been gilt and covered with flowered chintz , but it had been necessary to raise this settee to the first floor through the window , owing to the narrowness of the stairs: and hence it could not be reckoned on in any emergency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistine' s ambition to buy drawing - room furniture of mahogany and covered with yellow utrecht velvet , but this would have cost at least 500 francs , and seeing that she had only succeeded in saving for this object 42 francs 5 sous in five years , she gave up the idea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , who is there that ever attains his ideal? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing more simple can be imagined than the bishop' s bed - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two portraits , in oval frames , hung on the wall on either side of the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claude; the other the abb tourteau , vicar - general of agde , and abb of grand champs , belonging to the cistertian order in the diocese of chartres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop , on succeeding to the hospital infirmary , found the pictures there and left them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were priests , probably donors ,two motives for him to respect them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all he knew of the two personages was that they had been nominated by the king , the one to his bishopric , the other to his benefice , on the same day , april 27 , 1785 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how pleasant that is , -  he would say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistine' s bed - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rooms were paved with red bricks which were washed every week , and there were straw mats in front of all the beds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this house , moreover , managed by two females , was exquisitely clean from top to bottom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  to this plate must be added two heavy candlesticks of massive silver , which the bishop inherited from a great - aunt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these branched candlesticks each held two wax candles , and usually figured on the bishop' s chimney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had any one to dinner , madame magloire lit the candles and placed the two candlesticks on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the garden , spoiled to some extent by the ugly buildings to which we have referred , was composed of four walks , radiating round a cesspool; another walk ran all round the garden close to the surrounding white wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in three of them madame magloire grew vegetables; in the fourth the bishop had placed flowers; here and there were a few fruit - trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once madame magloire had said , with a sort of gentle malice ,  - monseigneur , although you turn everything to use , here is an unemployed plot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would be better to have lettuces there than bouquets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he added , after a moment' s silence ,  - more so , perhaps . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> this square , composed of three or four borders , occupied the bishop almost as much as his books did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he liked to spend an hour or two there , cutting , raking , and digging holes in which he placed seeds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was not so hostile to insects as a gardener would have liked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he greatly respected the professors , but he respected the ignorant even more; and without ever failing in this respect , he watered his borders every summer evening with a green - painted tin pot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the house had not a single door that locked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door of the dining - room , which , as we said , opened right on the cathedral square , had formerly been adorned with bolts and locks like a prison gate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the outset the two females had been greatly alarmed by this never - closed door; but the bishop said to them ,  - have bolts placed on the doors of your rooms if you like . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as regards the bishop , his idea is explained , or at least indicated , by these three lines , which he wrote on the margin of a bible:  - this is the distinction: the physician' s doors must never be closed , the priest' s door must always be open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  on another book , entitled  - philosophy of medical science , -  he wrote this other note:  - am i not a physician like them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i also have my patients: in the first place , i have theirs , whom they call the sick , and then i have my own , whom i call the unhappy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  elsewhere he also wrote:  - do not ask the name of the man who seeks a bed from you , for it is before all the man whom his name embarrasses that needs an asylum . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> it came about that a worthy curi forget whether it were he of couloubroux or he of pompierrythought proper to ask him one day , probably at the instigation of madame magloire , whether monseigneur was quite certain that he was not acting to some extent imprudently by leaving his door open day and night for any who liked to enter , and if he did not fear lest some misfortune might happen in a house so poorly guarded . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> then he spoke of something else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was seen first at jauziers , and next at tuiles; he concealed himself in the caverns of the joug de l' aigle , and descended thence on the hamlets and villages by the ravines of the ubaye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his brigandage desolated the country , and the gendarmes were in vain placed on his track . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he constantly escaped , and at times even offered resistance , for he was a bold scoundrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived on his visitation , and the mayor came to him and urged him to turn back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cravatte held the mountain as far as arche and beyond , and there was danger , even with an escort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for that reason , -  said the bishop ,  - i intend to go without escort . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - monseigneur , you will not do that!  - <s> <s>  - there is in the mountain , -  the bishop continued ,  - a humble little parish , which i have not visited for three years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are the owners of one goat out of every thirty they guard; they make very pretty woollen ropes of different colors , and they play mountain airs on small six - holed flutes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they want to hear about heaven every now and then , and what would they think of a bishop who was afraid? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what would they say if i did not go?  - <s> <s>  - but , monseigneur , the brigands . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - ah , -  said the bishop ,  - you are right; i may meet them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they too must want to hear about heaven . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - but this band is a flock of wolves . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - monsieur mayor , it may be that this is precisely the flock of which christ has made me the shepherd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who knows the ways of providence?  - <s> <s>  - monseigneur , they will plunder you . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i have nothing . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - they will kill you . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - a poor old priest who passes by , muttering his mummery? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nonsense , what good would that do them?  - <s> <s>  - oh , good gracious , if you were to meet them!  - <s> <s>  - i would ask them for alms for my poor . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - monseigneur , do not go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in heaven' s name do not , for you expose your life . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> there was no help for it , and he set out only accompanied by a lad , who offered to act as his guide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his obstinacy created a sensation in the country , and caused considerable alarm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would not take either his sister or madame magloire with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he crossed the mountain on a mule , met nobody , and reached his good friends the goat - herds safe and sound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained with them a fortnight , preaching , administering the sacraments , teaching , and moralizing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he was ready to start for home he resolved to sing a te deum pontifically , and spoke about it to the cur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what was to be done? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were no episcopal ornaments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that could be placed at his disposal was a poor village sacristy , with a few old faded and pinchbeck covered chasubles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pooh!  -  said the bishop;  - announce the te deum in your sermon for all that . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> inquiries were made in the surrounding churches: but all the magnificence of these united humble parishes would not have been sufficient decently to equip a cathedral chorister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the chest was opened and found to contain a cope of cloth of gold , a mitre adorned with diamonds , an archiepiscopal cross , a magnificent crozier , and all the pontifical robes stolen a month back from the treasury of our lady of embrun . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - did i not tell you that it would be all right?  -  the bishop said; then he added with a smile ,  - god sends an archbishop' s cope to a man who is contented with a cur' s surplice . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the bishop looked fixedly at the cur and repeated authoritatively ,  - god!  - <s> <s> when he returned to chastelon , and all along the road , he was regarded curiously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found at the presbytery of that town mlle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor priest went among these poor mountaineers with empty hands , and returns with his hands full . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i started only taking with me my confidence in heaven , and i bring back the treasures of a cathedral . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the great dangers are within ourselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us not trouble about what threatens our head or purse , and only think of what threatens our soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what his neighbor does god permits , so let us confine ourselves to praying to god when we believe that a danger is impending over us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us pray , not for ourselves , but that our brother may not fall into error on our account . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> events , however , were rare in his existence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we relate those we know , but ordinarily he spent his life in always doing the same things at the same moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a month of his year resembled an hour of his day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to what became of the treasure of embrun cathedral , we should be greatly embarrassed if questioned on that head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were many fine things , very tempting and famous to steal on behalf of the poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stolen they were already , one moiety of the adventure was accomplished: the only thing left to do was to change the direction of the robbery , and make it turn slightly towards the poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , we affirm nothing on the subject; we merely mention that among the bishop' s papers a rather obscure note was found , which probably refers to this question , and was thus conceived:  - the question is to know whether it ought to go to the cathedral or the hospital . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was an ex - procureur , softened by success , anything but a wicked man , doing all the little services in his power for his sons , his sons - in - law , his relatives , and even his friends: he had selected the best opportunities , and the rest seemed to him something absurd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was fond of laughing pleasantly at things infinite and eternal , and at the crotchets  - of our worthy bishop . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s>  - decidedly . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i declare to you , -  the senator went on ,  - that the marquis d' argens , pyrrho , hobbes , and naigeon are no impostors . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at certain moments , without his needing to mention the fact , or perhaps when he was not conscious of it , so perfect was his simplicity , they vaguely felt that he was acting episcopally , and at such times they were only two shadows in the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they knew , with an admirable intuitive delicacy , that certain attentions might vex him , and hence , though they might believe him in peril , they understood , i will not say his thoughts , but his nature , and no longer watched over him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at a period rather later than the date of the letter just quoted he did a thing which the whole town declared to be even more venturesome than his trip in the mountains among the bandits . </s> </s>

<s> <s> a conventionalist , only think of that! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those men existed at the time when people  - thou - ed -  one another and were called citizens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man was almost a monster: he had not voted for the king' s death , but had done all but that , and was a quasi - regicide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they need not have cut his head off , for clemency is all right and proper , but banishment for life would have been an example , and so on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , he was an atheist , like all those men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he had not voted the king' s death , he was not comprised in the decree of exile , and was enabled to remain in france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he lived about three miles from the town , far from every village , every road , in a nook of a very wild valley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had no neighbors , not even passers - by; since he had lived in the valley the path leading to it had become overgrown with grass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet the bishop thought of it , and from time to time gazed at a spot on the horizon where a clump of trees pointed out the old conventionalist' s valley , and said  - there is a soul there alone , -  and he added to himself ,  - i owe him a visit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for , in his heart , he shared the general impression , and the conventionalist inspired him , without his being able to account for it , with that feeling which is the border line of hatred , and which is so well expressed by the word  - estrangement . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> still the shepherd ought not to keep aloof from a scabby sheep; but then what a sheep it was! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the good bishop was perplexed; at times he started in that direction , but turned back . </s> </s>

<s> <s> happy release! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sun had almost attained the horizon when the bishop reached the excommunicated spot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he perceived with a certain heart - beating that he was close to the wild beast' s den . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a low , poor - looking hut , small and clean , with a vine nailed over the front . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thanks , -  he said ,  - i want nothing further , -  and his smile was turned from the sun to rest on the boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - since i have lived here , -  he said ,  - you are the first person who has come to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who may you be , sir?  - <s> <s> the bishop answered ,  - my name is bienvenu myriel . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i have heard that name uttered . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the old man continued , with a half - smile ,  - in that case you are my bishop?  - <s> <s>  - a little . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the conventionalist offered his hand to the bishop , but the bishop did not take ithe confined himself to saying ,<s> <s>  - i am pleased to see that i was deceived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you certainly do not look ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am a bit of a physician , and know in what way the last hour comes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yesterday only my feet were cold; to - day the chill reached my knees; now i can feel it ascending to my waist , and when it reaches the heart i shall stop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sun is glorious , is it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had myself wheeled out in order to take a farewell glance at things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have done well to come and look at a dying man , for it is proper that there should be witnesses . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> the bishop was not so moved as we might imagine he would be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not think that he saw god in this way of dying: andlet us out with it , as the small contradictions of great hearts must also be indicatedhe , who at times laughed so heartily at his grandeur , was somewhat annoyed at not being called monseigneur , and was almost tempted to reply , citizen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt an inclination for coarse familiarity , common enough with doctors and priests , but to which he was not accustomed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the republican , in the mean while , regarded him with modest cordiality , in which , perhaps , could be traced that humility which is so becoming in a man who is on the point of returning to the dust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop , on his side , though he generally guarded against curiosity , which according to him was akin to insult , could not refrain from examining the conventionalist with an attention which , as it did not emanate from sympathy , would have pricked his conscience in the case of any other man . </s> </s>

<s> <s> g at this awful moment resembled the king in the oriental legend , flesh above and marble below . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop sat down on a stone and began rather abruptly: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i congratulate you , -  he said , in the tone people employ to reprimand;  - at least you did not vote the king' s death . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the republican did not seem to notice the covert bitterness of this remark , at least; he replied , without a smile on his face ,<s> <s>  - do not congratulate me , sir: i voted the death of the tyrant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean?  -  the bishop continued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i mean that man has a tyrant , ignorance , and i voted for the end of that tyrant which engendered royalty , which is the false authority , while knowledge is the true authority . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> conscience is the amount of innate knowledge we have in us . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> monseigneur welcome listened in some surprise to this language , which was very novel to him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i said no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not believe that i have the right to kill a man , but i feel the duty of exterminating a tyrant , and i voted for the end of the tyrant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in voting for the republic i voted for all this: i voted for fraternity , concord , the dawn! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i aided in the overthrow of errors and prejudices , and such an overthrow produces light; we hurled down the old world , and that vase of wretchedness , by being poured over the human race , became an urn of joy . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - mingled joy , -  said the bishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you might call it a troubled joy , and now , after that fatal return of the past which is called 1814 , a departed joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not sufficient to destroy abuses , but morals must also be modified . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though the mill no longer exists , the wind still blows . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - you demolished: it may be useful , but i distrust a demolition complicated with passion . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - right has its passion , sir bishop , and that passion is an element of progress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no matter what may be said , the french revolution is the most powerful step taken by the human race since the advent of christ . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it may be incomplete , but it was sublime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it softened minds , it calmed , appeased , and enlightened , and it spread civilization over the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the french revolution was good , for it was the consecration of humanity . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the bishop could not refrain from muttering , - yes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ' 93!  - <s> <s> the republican drew himself up with almost mournful solemnity , and shouted , as well as a dying man could shout ,<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there we have it! </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the bishop , without perhaps confessing it to himself , felt that the blow had gone home; still he kept a good countenance , and answered ,<s> <s>  - the judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in that of pity , which is only a higher form of justice . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> and he added as he looked fixedly at the conventionalist ,<s> <s>  - and louis xvii . </s> </s>

<s> <s> let us consider . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whom do you weep for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it the innocent child? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in that case i weep with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it the royal child? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in that case i must ask leave to reflect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , the innocent boy martyrized in the temple tower for the sole crime of being the grandson of louis xv . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - louis xv . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on behalf of which do you protest?  - <s> <s> there was a moment' s silence; the bishop almost regretted having come , and yet felt himself vaguely and strangely shaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the conventionalist continued ,<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his lightning lash was a rough discourser of truths . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made no difference between the dauphin of barabbas and the dauphin of herod . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - that is true , -  said the bishop in a low voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have named louis xvii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall we weep for all the innocents , martyrs , and children of the lowest as of the highest rank? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am with you there , but as i said , in that case we must go back beyond ' 93 , and begin our tears before louis xvii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will weep over the children of the kings with you , provided that you weep with me over the children of the people . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i weep for all , -  said the bishop . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> there was again a silence , which the republican broke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he rose on his elbow , held his chin with his thumb and forefinger , as a man does mechanically when he is interrogating and judging , and fixed on the bishop a glance full of all the energy of approaching death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but let me ask why you have come to question and speak to me about louis xvii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ever since i have been in this country i have lived here alone , never setting my foot across the threshold , and seeing no one but the boy who attends to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your name , it is true , has vaguely reached me , and i am bound to say that it was pronounced affectionately , but that means nothing , for clever people have so many ways of making the worthy , simple folk believe in them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not know you , i tell you; you have informed me that you are the bishop , but that teaches me nothing as to your moral character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a wordi repeat my question , who are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are a bishop , that is to say , a prince of the church , one of those gilded , escutcheoned annuitants who have fat prebendsthe bishopric of d , with 15 ,000 francs income , 10 ,000 francs fees , or a total of 25 ,000 francs ,who have kitchens , liveries , keep a good table , and eat water - fowl on a friday; who go about , with lackeys before and behind , in a gilded coach , in the name of the saviour who walked barefoot! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are a prelate; you have , like all the rest , income , palace , horses , valets , a good table , and like all the rest you enjoy them: that is all very well , but it says either too much or too little; it does not enlighten me as to your intrinsic and essential value when you come with the probable intention of bringing me wisdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to whom am i speakingwho are you?  - <s> <s> the bishop bowed his head , and answered ,  - i am a worm . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - a worm in a carriage!  -  the republican growled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but explain to me how my coach , which is a little way off behind the trees , my good table , and the water - fowl i eat on friday , my palace , my income , and my footmen , prove that pity is not a virtue , that clemency is not a duty , and that ' 93 was not inexorable . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the republican passed his hand over his forehead , as if to remove a cloud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - before answering you , -  he said ,  - i must ask you to forgive me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was in the wrong , sir , for you are in my house and my guest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you discuss my ideas , and i must restrict myself to combating your reasoning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your wealth and enjoyments are advantages which i have over you in the debate , but courtesy bids me not employ them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where were we? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was it you said , that ' 93 was inexorable?  - <s> <s>  - yes , inexorable , -  the bishop said;  - what do you think of marat clapping his hands at the guillotine?  - <s> <s>  - what do you think of bossuet singing a te deum over the dragonnades?  - <s> <s> the response was harsh , but went to its mark with the rigidity of a mini bullet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop started , and could not parry it , but he was hurt by this way of mentioning bossuet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the best minds have their fetishes , and at times feel vaguely wounded by any want of respect on the part of logic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the conventionalist was beginning to gasp; that asthma which is mingled with the last breath affected his voice; still he retained perfect mental clearness in his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he continued ,<s> <s>  - let us say a few words more on this head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beyond the revolution , which , taken in its entirety , is an immense human affirmation , ' 93 , alas , is a reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you consider it inexorable , but what was the whole monarchy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fouquier tainville is a scoundrel , but what is your opinion about lamoignon - bville? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> father duchne is ferocious , but what epithet will you allow me for pre letellier? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do you say of this punishment of tantalus adapted to a woman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> remember this carefully , sir , the french revolution had its reasons , and its wrath will be absolved by the future . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> its result is a better world; and a caress for the human race issues from its most terrible blows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must stop , for the game is all in my favorbesides , i am dying . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> and ceasing to regard the bishop , the republican finished his thought with the following few calm words ,<s> <s>  - yes , the brutalities of progress are called revolutions , but when they are ended , this fact is recognized; the human race has been chastised , but it has moved onwards . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the republican did not suspect that he had carried in turn every one of the bishop' s internal intrenchments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - progress must believe in god , and the good cannot have impious servants . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the ex - representative of the people did not reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he trembled , looked up to the sky , and a tear slowly collected in his eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the lid was full the tear ran down his livid cheek , and he said in a low , shaking voice , as if speaking to himself ,<s> <s>  - oh thou! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thou alone existest!  - <s> <s> the bishop had a sort of inexpressible commotion; after a silence the old man raised a finger to heaven and said ,<s> <s>  - the infinite is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if the infinite had not a me , the i would be its limit; it would not be infinite; in other words , it would not be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hence it has a me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this i of the infinite is god . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the dying man uttered these words in a loud voice , and with a shudder of ecstasy as if he saw some one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had spoken his eyes closed , for the effort had exhausted him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was evident that he had lived in one minute the few hours left him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this hour is god' s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would you not consider it matter of regret if we had met in vain?  - <s> <s> the republican opened his eyes again; a gravity which suggested the shadow of death was imprinted on his countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your blessing!  -  said the bishop , and knelt down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur le bishop , -  he said , with a slowness produced perhaps more by the dignity of the soul than by failing of his strength ,  - i have spent my life in meditation , contemplation , and study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was sixty years of age when my country summoned me and ordered me to interfere in its affairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i obeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was one of the masters of the state; the bank cellars were so filled with specie that it was necessary to prop up the walls , which were ready to burst through the weight of gold and silver , but i dined in the rue de l' arbre sec , at two - and - twenty sous a head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i succored the oppressed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i tore up the altar cloth , it is true , but it was to stanch the wounds of the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ever supported the onward march of the human race towards light , and i at times resisted pitiless progress . </s> </s>

<s> <s> after which i was driven out , tracked , pursued , persecuted , maligned , mocked , spat upon , accursed , and proscribed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for many years i have felt that persons believed they had a right to despise me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my face has been held accursed by the poor ignorant mob , and , while hating no one , i accepted the isolation of hatred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , i am eighty - six years of age and on the point of death; what have you come to ask of me?  - <s> <s>  - your blessing!  -  said the bishop , and knelt down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the bishop raised his head again , the conventionalist' s countenance had become august: he had just expired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop returned home absorbed in the strangest thoughts , and spent the whole night in prayer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the morrow curious worthies tried to make him talk about g the republican , but he only pointed to heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from this moment he redoubled his tenderness and fraternity for the little ones and the suffering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this  - pastoral visit -  nearly created a stir among the small local coteries . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - was it a bishop' s place to visit the death - bed of such a man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then why go? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he must have been very curious to see the fiend carry off a soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fortunately those who despise it in a cap venerate it in a hat . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> we should run a strong risk of making a mistake were we to conclude from this that monseigneur welcome was  - a philosophic bishop , -  or  - a patriotic cur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  his meeting , which might almost be called his conjunction , with the conventionalist g produced in him a sort of amazement , which rendered him more gentle than ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that was all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though monseigneur was anything rather than a politician , this is perhaps the place to indicate briefly what was his attitude in the events of that period , supposing that monseigneur ever dreamed of having an attitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will , therefore , go back for a few years . </s> </s>

<s> <s> myriel' s elevation to the episcopate , the emperor made him a baron , simultaneously with some other bishops . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this synod was held at notre dame and assembled for the first time on june 15 , 1811 , under the presidency of cardinal fesch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> myriel was one of the ninety - five bishops convened , but he was only present at one session and three or four private conferences . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as bishop of a mountain diocese , living so near to nature in rusticity and poverty , it seems that he introduced among these eminent personages ideas which changed the temperature of the assembly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those messeigneurs are princes , while i am only a poor peasant bishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what splendid carpets! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what magnificent liveries! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should not like to have such superfluities to yell incessantly in my ears: there are people who are hungry; there are people who are cold; there are poor , there are poor . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> let us remark parenthetically , that a hatred of luxury would not be an intelligent hatred , for it would imply a hatred of the arts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can we imagine a workman constantly toiling at a furnace , and have neither a hair burned , a nail blackened , nor a drop of perspiration , nor grain of soot on his face? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was doubtless the opinion of the bishop of d . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from 1813 he adhered to or applauded all hostile demonstrations , he refused to see him when he passed through on his return from elba , and abstained from ordering public prayers for the emperor during the hundred days . </s> </s>

<s> <s> baptistine , he had two brothers , one a general , the other a prefect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wrote very frequently to both of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his correspondence was more affectionate with the other brother , the ex - prefect , a worthy , honest man , who lived retired at paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the shadow of the passions of the moment fell athwart this gentle and great mind , which was occupied by things eternal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> certainly such a man would have deserved to have no political opinions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray let there be no mistake as to our meaning: we do not confound what are called  - political opinions -  with the grand aspiration for progress , with that sublime , patriotic , democratic and human faith , which in our days must be the foundation of all generous intelligence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without entering into questions which only indirectly affect the subject of this book , we say , it would have been better had monseigneur welcome not been a royalist , and if his eye had not turned away , even for a moment , from that serene contemplation , in which the three pure lights of truth , justice , and charity are seen beaming above the fictions and hatreds of this world , and above the stormy ebb and flow of human affairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while allowing that god had not created monseigneur welcome for political functions , we could have understood and admired a protest in the name of justice and liberty , a proud opposition , a perilous and just resistance offered to napoleon , all - powerful . </s> </s>

<s> <s> 1812 begins to disarm us; in 1813 the cowardly rupture of silence by the taciturn legislative corps , emboldened by catastrophes , could only arouse indignation; in 1814 , in the presence of the traitor marshals , in the presence of that senate , passing from one atrocity to another , and insulting after deifying , and before the idolaters kicking their idol and spitting on it , it was a duty to turn one' s head away; in 1815 , as supreme disasters were in the air , as france had a shudder of their sinister approach , as waterloo , already open before napoleon could be vaguely distinguished , the dolorous acclamation offered by the army and the people had nothing laughable about it , andleaving the despot out of the questiona heart like the bishop of d' s ought not to have misunderstood how much there was august and affecting in this close embrace between a great nation and a great man on the verge of an abyss . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this exception , the bishop was in all things just , true , equitable , intelligent , humble , and worthy; beneficent , and benevolent , which is another form of beneficence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a priest , a sage , and a man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even in the political opinions with which we have reproached him , and which we are inclined to judge almost severely , we are bound to add that he was tolerant and facile , more so perhaps than the writer of these lines . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and perhaps it does so in good faith and in self - deception , for it is so unworldly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was visible in the utter absence of young priests around him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his canons and vicars were good old men , walled up like him in this diocese which had no issue to the cardinal' s hat , and who resembled their bishop with this difference , that they were finished while he was completed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the impossibility of growing up near monseigneur welcome was so well felt , that young priests whom he ordained at once obtained letters commendatory to the archbishop of aix , or auch , and went off at score . </s> </s>

<s> <s> a saint who lives in a state of excessive self - denial is a dangerous neighbor , he might possibly communicate to you by contagion an incurable poverty , a stiffening of the joints useful for advancement , and , in a word , more renunciation than you care for: and such scabby virtue is shunned . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it is not our business to gauge the bishop of d from an orthodox point of view . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the presence of such a soul we only feel inclined to respect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what did he think of this dogma or that mystery? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what we are certain of is , that he never solved difficulties of faith by hypocrisy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he believed as much as he possibly could , and would frequently exclaim ,  - i believe in the father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he also derived from his good deeds that amount of satisfaction which suffices the conscience , and which whispers to you ,  - you are with god . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> what we think it our duty to note is that , beyond his faith , he had an excess of love . </s> </s>

<s> <s> what was this excess of love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every man , even the best , has in him an unreflecting harshness , which he reserves for animals , but the bishop of d had not this harshness , which is , however , peculiar to many priests . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not go so far as the brahmin , but seemed to have meditated on the words of ecclesiastes - who knoweth the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?  -  an ugly appearance , a deformity of instinct , did not trouble him or render him indignant; he was moved , almost softened , by them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed as if he thoughtfully sought , beyond apparent life , for the cause , the explanation , or the excuse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he examined without anger , and with the eye of a linguist deciphering a palimpsest , the amount of chaos which still exists in nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one morning he was in his garden and fancied himself alone; but his sister was walking behind , though unseen by him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stopped and looked at something on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a large black , hairy , horrible spider . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  why should we not repeat this almost divine childishness of goodness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it may be puerile , but of such were the puerilities of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> francis d' assisi and marcus aurelius . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such was the way in which this just man lived: at times he fell asleep in his garden , and then nothing could be more venerable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monseigneur welcome had been formerly , if we may believe the stories about his youth and even his manhood , a passionate , perhaps violent man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in 1815 , as we think we have said , he reached his seventy - fifth year , but did not seem sixty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was not tall , and had a tendency to stoutness , which he strove to combat by long walks; he stood firmly , and was but very slightly built . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the age of eighty was erect and smiling , which did not prevent him being a bad priest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his fresh , ruddy complexion , and all his white teeth , which he had preserved and displayed when he laughed , gave him that open facile air which makes you say of an aged man ,  - he is a worthy person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the first glance , and when you saw him for the first time , he was in reality only a worthy man , but if you remained some hours in his company , and saw him in thought , he became gradually transfigured and assumed something imposing; his wide and serious brow , already august through the white hair , became also august through meditation; majesty was evolved from the goodness; though the latter did not cease to gleam , you felt the same sort of emotion as you would if you saw a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings without ceasing to smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an inexpressible respect gradually penetrated you and ascended to your head , and you felt that you had before you one of those powerful , well - bred , and indulgent souls whose thoughts are so great that they cannot but be gentle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as we have seen , prayer , celebration of the mass , almsgiving , consoling the afflicted , tilling a patch of ground , frugality , hospitality , self - denial , confidence , study , and labor , filled every day of his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> filled is the exact word , and certainly the bishop' s day was full of good thoughts , good words , and good actions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , it was not complete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if cold or wet weather prevented him from spending an hour or two in the garden before going to bed after the two females had retired , it seemed as it were a species of rite of his to prepare himself for sleep by meditation , in the presence of the grand spectacle of the heavens by night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at times , even at an advanced hour of night , if the women were not asleep , they heard him slowly pacing the walks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he considered this magnificent concourse of atoms which reveals forces , creates individualities in unity , proportions in space , innumerability in the infinite , and through light produces beauty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would sit down on a wood bench with his back against a rickety trellis , and gaze at the stars through the stunted sickly profiles of his fruit trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this quarter of an acre , so poorly planted , and so encumbered with sheds and out - houses , was dear to him , and was sufficient for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what more was wanting to this aged man , who divided the leisure of his life , which knew so little leisure , between gardening by day and contemplation by night? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was not this limited enclosure with the sky for its roof sufficient for him to be able to adore god by turns in his most delicious and most sublime works? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was not this everything , in fact? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what could be desired beyond? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a small garden to walk about in , and immensity to dream in; at his feet , what can be cultivated and gathered; over his head , what can be studied and meditated; a few flowers on the earth , and all the stars in the heavens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as these details might , especially at the present day , and to employ an expression which is now fashionable , give the bishop of d a certain  - pantheistic -  physiognomy , and cause it to be believed , either to his praise or blame , that he had in him one of those personal philosophies peculiar to our age , which germinate sometimes in solitary minds , and grow until they take the place of religion , we must lay stress on the fact that not one of the persons who knew monseigneur welcome believed himself authorized in thinking anything of the sort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what enlightened this man was his heart , and his wisdom was the product of the light which emanates from it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had no systems , but abundance of deeds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the apostle may be bold , but the bishop must be timid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he probably refrained from going too deep into certain problems reserved to some extent for great and terrible minds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a sacred horror beneath the portals of the enigma; the dark chasms gape before you , but something tells you that you must not enter: woe to him who penetrates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> geniuses , in the profundities of abstraction and pure speculation , being situated , so to speak , above dogmas , propose their ideas to god; their prayer audaciously offers a discussion , and their adoration interrogates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> human meditation has no limits; at its own risk and peril it analyzes and produces its own bedazzlement; we might almost say that , through a species of splendid reaction , it dazzles nature with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however this may be , there are in the world menare they men? who distinctly perceive on the horizon of dreamland the heights of the absolute , and have the terrible vision of the mountain of the infinite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would have feared these sublimities , on which even very great men , like swedenborg and pascal , fell in their insanity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is probable that he expanded prayer into a superhuman aspiration; but a man can no more pray too much than he can love too much , and if it were a heresy to pray further than the text , st theresa and st jrme would be heretics . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he bent down over all that groaned and all that expiated; the universe appeared to him an immense malady; he felt a fever everywhere; he heard the panting of suffering all around him , and without trying to solve the enigma , he sought to heal the wound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the formidable spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him; he was solely engaged in finding for himself and arousing in others the best way of pitying and relieving . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> existence was to this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sorrow seeking for consolation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are some men who toil to extract gold , but he labored to extract pity; the universal wretchedness was his mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sorrow all around was only an opportunity for constant kindness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your ' love one another'  is nonsense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -   - well , -  monseigneur welcome replied , without discussion ,  - if it be nonsense , the soul must shut itself up in it like the pearl in the oyster . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he consequently shut himself up in it , lived in it , was absolutely satisfied with it , leaving on one side those prodigious questions which attract and terrify , the unfathomable perspectives of the abstract , the precipices of metaphysics , all those depths which for the apostle converge in god , for the atheist in nothingness: destiny , good , and evil , the war of being against being , human consciousness , the pensive somnambulism of the animal , transformation through death , the recapitulation of existences which the grave contains , the incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the enduring me , essence , substance , the nil and ens nature , liberty , necessity; in a word , he avoided all the gloomy precipices over which the gigantic archangels of the human mind bend , the formidable abysses which lucretius , manou , st . </s> </s>

<s> <s> his stockingless feet were thrust into iron - shod shoes , his hair was clipped , and his beard long . </s> </s>

<s> <s> where did he come from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the south perhaps , the sea - board , for he made his entrance into d by the same road napoleon had driven along seven months previously when going from cannes to paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man must have been walking all day , for he seemed very tired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some women in the old suburb at the lower part of the town had seen him halt under the trees on the gassendi boulevard , and drink from the fountain at the end of the walk . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> while the new - comer had his back turned to warm himself , the worthy landlord took a pencil from his pocket , and then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which lay on a small table near the window . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he walked on thus for a long time , turning down streets he did not know , and forgetting his fatigue , as happens in sorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all at once he was sharply assailed by hunger: night was approaching , and he looked round to see whether he could not discover a shelter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the best inn was closed against him , and he sought some very humble pot - house , some wretched den . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went towards it: it was really a pot - house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger stopped for a moment and looked through the window into the low tap - room , which was lighted up by a small lamp on the table and a large fire on the hearth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some men were drinking , and the landlord was warming himself; over the flames bubbled a caldron hanging from an iron hook . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this pot - house , which is also a sort of inn , has two entrances , one on the street , the other opening on a small yard full of manure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the traveller did not dare enter by the street door: he slipped into the yard , stopped once again , and then timidly raised the latch and opened the door . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - some one who wants a supper and bed . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - very good . </s> </s>

<s> <s> said the landlord to him ,  - here is a fire; supper is boiling in the pot: come and warm yourself , comrade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a pleasant smell issued from the caldron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was , moreover , a firm , energetic , and sad profile; the face was strangely composed , for it began by appearing humble and ended by becoming severe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his eyes gleamed under his brows , like a fire under brushwood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the men seated at the table was a fishmonger , who , before entering the pot - house , had gone to put up his horse in labarre' s stables . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the man had fallen back into his reverie . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the stranger turned and replied gently ,  - ah , you know?  - <s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i was turned out of the other inn . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - and so you will be out of this . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - where would you have me go?  - <s> <s>  - somewhere else . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the man took his knapsack and stick and went away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned savagely , and threatened them with his stick , and the boys dispersed like a flock of birds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he passed in front of the prison , and pulled the iron bell - handle; a wicket was opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jailer , -  he said , as he humbly doffed his cap ,  - would you be kind enough to open the door and give me a nights lodging?  - <s> <s> a voice answered ,  - a prison is not an inn; get yourself arrested , and then i will open the door . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the man entered a small street , in which there are numerous gardens , some of them being merely enclosed with hedges , which enliven the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> among these gardens and hedges he saw a single - storeyed house , whose window was illuminated , and he looked through the panes as he had done at the pot - house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a large white - washed room , with a bed with printed chintz curtains , and a cradle in a corner , a few chairs , and a double - barrelled gun hanging on the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a table was laid for supper in the middle of the room; a copper lamp lit up the coarse white cloth , the tin mug glistening like silver and full of wine , and the brown smoking soup - tureen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this table was seated a man of about forty years of age , with a hearty , open face , who was riding a child on his knee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger stood for a moment pensively before this gentle and calming spectacle; what was going on within him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he tapped very slightly on a window pane , but was not heard; he tapped a second time , and he heard the woman say ,  - husband , i fancy i can hear some one knocking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he tapped a third time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a tall man , half peasant , half artisan; he wore a huge , leathern apron , which came up to his left shoulder , and on which he carried a hammer , a red handkerchief , a powder - flask , and all sorts of things , which his belt held like a pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he threw back his head , his turned - down shirt - collar displayed his full neck , white and bare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i beg your pardon , sir , -  the traveller said ,  - but would you , for payment , give me a plateful of soup and a corner to sleep in in your garden outhouse?  - <s> <s>  - who are you?  -  the owner of the cottage asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man answered ,  - i have come from puy moisson , i have walked the whole day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> could you do it ,for payment of course?  - <s> <s>  - i would not refuse , -  the peasant answered ,  - to lodge any respectable person who paid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but why do you not go to the inn?  - <s> <s>  - there is no room there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is impossible; it is neither market nor fair day . </s> </s> 
 . </s> </s> 
 . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he took another look at the stranger , placed the lamp on the table , and took down his gun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after examining the man for some minutes as if he had been a viper , the peasant returned to the door and said:  - be off!  - <s> <s>  - for mercy' s sake , -  the man continued , - a glass of water . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - a charge of shot!  -  the peasant said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a moment after the window shutters were closed , and the sound of the iron bar being put in reached his ear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> night was coming on apace: the cold wind of the alps was blowing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the light of the expiring day the stranger noticed in one of the gardens a sort of hut which seemed to him to be made of sods of turf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he doubtless thought it was such: he was suffering from cold and hunger , and though he had made up his mind to starve , it was at any rate a shelter against the cold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as this sort of residence is not usually occupied at night , he lay down on his stomach and crawled into the hut: it was warm , and he found a rather good straw litter in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment a hoarse growl was audible: he raised his eyes , and the head of an enormous mastiff stood out in the shadow at the opening of the hut , which was its kennel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dog itself was strong and formidable , hence he raised his stick , employed his knapsack as a shield , and left the kennel as he best could , though not without enlarging the rents in his rags . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he also left the garden , but backwards , and compelled to twirl his stick in order to keep the dog at a respectful distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he soon rose and recommenced his walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he left the town hoping to find some tree or mill in the fields which would afford him shelter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was in a field , and had in front of him one of those low hills with close - cut stubble , which after harvest resemble cropped heads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , as the moon was about to rise shortly , and a remnant of twilight still hovered in the zenith , these clouds formed a species of whitish vault whence a gleam of light was thrown on the earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ground was therefore more illumined than the sky , which produces a peculiarly sinister effect , and the hill with its paltry outlines stood out vaguely and dully on the gloomy horizon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole scene was hideous , mean , mournful , and confined; there was nothing in the field or on the hill but a stunted tree , which writhed and trembled a few yards from the traveller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man was evidently far from possessing those delicate habits of mind which render persons sensible of the mysterious aspects of things , still there was in the sky , this hill , this plain , and this tree , something so profoundly desolate , that after standing motionless and thoughtful for a while he suddenly turned back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are instants in which nature seems to be hostile . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it might be about eight o' clock in the evening , and as he did not know the streets he wandered about without purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thus reached the prefecture and then the seminary; on passing through the cathedral square he shook his fist at the church . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> worn out with fatigue , and hopeless , he sat down on the stone bench at the door of this printing - office . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an old lady who was leaving the church at the moment saw the man stretched out in the darkness . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - on that bench?  -  she continued . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - why do you not go to the inn?  - <s> <s>  - because i have no money . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - you can give them to me all the same . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the man took the money , and madame de r continued ,  - you cannot lodge at an inn for so small a sum , still you should make the attempt , for you cannot possibly spend the night here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> doubtless you are cold and hungry , and some one might take you in for charity . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i have knocked at every door . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - well?  - <s> <s>  - and was turned away at all . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the  - good woman -  touched the man' s arm and pointed to a small house next to the bishop' s palace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have , -  she continued ,  - knocked at every door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you done so there?  - <s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - then do it . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> on this evening , the bishop of d , after his walk in the town , had remained in his bed - room till a late hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was engaged on a heavy work on the  - duties , -  which he unfortunately has left incomplete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was still working at eight o' clock , writing rather uncomfortably on small squares of paper , with a large book open on his knees , when madame magloire came in as usual to fetch the plate from the wall - cupboard near the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a moment after , the bishop , feeling that supper was ready , and that his sister might be waiting , closed his book , rose from the table , and walked into the dining - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was an oblong apartment , as we have said , with a door opening on the street , and a window looking on the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a lamp was on the table , which was close to the chimney , in which a tolerable fire was lighted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we can easily figure to ourselves the two females , who had both passed their sixtieth year: madame magloire , short , stout , and quick: mademoiselle baptistine , gentle , thin , and frail , somewhat taller than her brother , dressed in a puce - colored silk gown , the fashionable color in 1806 , which she had bought in paris in that year and which still held out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame magloire wore a white cap , on her neck a gold jeannette , the only piece of feminine jewelry in the house , a very white handkerchief emerging from a black stuff gown with wide and short sleeves , a calico red and puce checked apron , fastened round the waist with a green ribbon , with a stomacher of the same stuff fastened with two pins at the top corners , heavy shoes and yellow stockings , like the marseilles women . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so long as monseigneur was silent , she spoke to him boldly with a mingled respect and liberty , but so soon as he spoke she passively obeyed , like mademoiselle , who no longer replied , but restricted herself to obeying and enduring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even when she was young the latter was not pretty; she had large blue eyes , flush with her head , and a long peaked nose; but all her face , all her person , as we said at the outset , breathed ineffable kindness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had always been predestined to gentleness , but faith , hope , and charity , those three virtues that softly warm the soul , had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nature had only made her a lamb , and religion had made her an angel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sweet departed recollection! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mademoiselle afterwards narrated so many times what took place at the bishopric on this evening that several persons still living remember the slightest details . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the moment when the bishop entered madame magloire was talking with some vivacity; she was conversing with mademoiselle on a subject that was familiar to her , and to which the bishop was accustomedit was the matter of the frontdoor latch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the police were very badly managed because the prefect and the mayor were not friendly , and tried to injure each other by allowing things to happen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame magloire italicized the last sentence , but the bishop had come from his room where it was rather cold , and was warming himself at the fire while thinking of other matters; in fact , he did not pick up the words which madame magloire had just let drop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she repeated them , and then mademoiselle , who wished to satisfy madame magloire without displeasing her brother , ventured to say timidly ,<s> <s>  - brother , do you hear what madame magloire is saying?  - <s> <s>  - i vaguely heard something , -  the bishop answered; then he half turned his chair , placed his hand on his knees , and looked up at the old servant with his cordial and easily - pleased face , which the fire illumined from below:  - well , what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are we in any great danger?  - <s> <s> then madame magloire told her story over again , while exaggerating it slightly , though unsuspicious of the fact . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would seem that a gypsy , a barefooted fellow , a sort of dangerous beggar , was in the town at the moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had been seen prowling about the streets at nightfall , and was evidently a gallows bird , with his frightful face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is he really?  -  said the bishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you go out and find yourself in pitch darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say , monseigneur , and mademoiselle says - <s> <s>  - i , -  the sister interrupted ,  - say nothing; whatever my brother does is right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no occasion to ask for permission . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> at this moment there was a rather loud rap at the front door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come in , -  said the bishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door was thrown open wide , as if some one were pushing it energetically and resolutely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man entered whom we already know; it was the traveller whom we saw just now wandering about in search of a shelter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he entered and stopped , leaving the door open behind him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had his knapsack on his shoulder , his stick in his hand , and a rough , bold , wearied , and violent expression in his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry , she shivered and stood with widely - open mouth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mademoiselle baptistine turned , perceived the man who entered , and half started up in terror; then , gradually turning her head to the chimney , she began looking at her brother , and her face became again calm and serene . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my name is jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am a galley - slave , and have spent nineteen years in the bagne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was liberated four days ago , and started for pontarlier , which is my destination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have been walking for four days since i left toulon , and to - day i have marched twelve leagues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i went to another inn , and the landlord said to me ,  - be off!  -  it was the same everywhere , and no one would have any dealings with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i went to the prison , but the jailer would not take me in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i went into the fields to sleep in the star - light , but there were no stars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought it would rain , and as there was no god to prevent it from raining , i came back to the town to sleep in a doorway . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was lying down on a stone in the square , when a good woman pointed to your house , and said ,  - go and knock there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  what sort of a house is this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you keep an inn? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have money , 109 francs 15 sous , which i earned at the bagne by my nineteen years'  toil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will pay , for what do i care for that , as i have money! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am very tired and frightfully hungry; will you let me stay here?  - <s> <s>  - madame magloire , -  said the bishop ,  - you will lay another knife and fork . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait a minute , -  he continued , as if he had not comprehended ,  - that will not do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you not hear me say that i was a galley - slave , a convict , and have just come from the bagne?  -  he took from his pocket a large yellow paper , which he unfolded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here is my passport , yellow as you see , which turns me out wherever i go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can read it , for i learned to do so at the bagne , where there is a school for those who like to attend it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is what is written in my passport: ' jean valjean , a liberated convict , native of' but that does not concern you' has remained nineteen years at the galleys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man is very dangerous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is this an inn? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you give me some food and a bed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you a stable?  - <s> <s>  - madame magloire , -  said the bishop ,  - you will put clean sheets on the bed in the alcove . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame magloire left the room to carry out the orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we shall sup directly , and your bed will be got ready while we are supping . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the man understood this at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the expression of his face , which had hitherto been gloomy and harsh , was marked with stupefaction , joy , doubt , and became extraordinary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he began stammering like a lunatic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will let me stay , you will not turn me out , a convict? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you call me sir , you do not ' thou'  me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ' get out , dog! '  that is what is always said to me; i really believed that you would turn me out , and hence told you at once who i am . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall have supper , a bed with mattresses and sheets , like everybody else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for nineteen years i have not slept in a bed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you really mean that i am to stay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are worthy people; besides , i have money , and will pay handsomely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the way , what is your name , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> landlord? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you keep an inn , do you not?  - <s> <s>  - i am , -  said the bishop ,  - a priest living in this house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a worthy priest! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cur , i suppose ,the cur of that big church? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh yes , what an ass i am! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did not notice your cassock . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> while speaking he deposited his knapsack and stick in a corner , returned his passport to his pocket , and sat down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a good priest is very good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how long did you take in earning these 109 francs?  - <s> <s>  - nineteen years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man went on:  - i have all my money still; in four days i have only spent 25 sous , which i earned by helping to unload carts at grasse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as you are an abb i will tell you: we had a chaplain at the bagne , and one day i saw a bishop , monseigneur , as they call him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is the cur over the curs , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pardon , i express it badly; but it is so far above me , a poor convict , you see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said mass in the middle of the bagne at an altar , and had a pointed gold thing on his head , which glistened in the bright sunshine; we were drawn up on three sides of a square , with guns and lighted matches facing us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he spoke , but was too far off , and we did not hear him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is what a bishop is . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> while he was speaking the bishop had gone to close the door , which had been left open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame magloire , -  said the bishop ,  - lay them as near as you can to the fire; -  and turning to his guest , he said ,  - the night breeze is sharp on the alps , and you must be cold , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sir to a convict is the glass of water to the shipwrecked sailor of the mduse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ignominy thirsts for respect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame magloire understood , and fetched from the chimney of monseigneur' s bed - room the two silver candlesticks , which she placed on the table ready lighted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur le cur , -  said the man ,  - you are good , and do not despise me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you receive me as a friend and light your wax candles for me , and yet i have not hidden from you whence i come , and that i am an unfortunate fellow . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the bishop , who was seated by his side , gently touched his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you need not have told me who you were; this is not my house , but the house of christ . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this door does not ask a man who enters whether he has a name , but if he has a sorrow; you are suffering , you are hungry and thirsty , and so be welcome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , before you told it to me you had one which i knew . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the man opened his eyes in amazement . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - monsieur le cur , -  the man exclaimed ,  - i was very hungry when i came in , but you are so kind that i do not know at present what i feel; it has passed over . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the bishop looked at him and said ,<s> <s>  - you have suffered greatly?  - <s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the very dogs are happier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nineteen years! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now i am forty - six; and at present , the yellow passport! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there it is!  - <s> <s>  - yes , -  said the bishop ,  - you have come from a place of sorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you leave that mournful place with thoughts of hatred and anger against your fellow - men you are worthy of pity; if you leave it with thoughts of kindliness , gentleness , and peace , you are worth more than any of us . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> in the meanwhile madame magloire had served the soup: it was made of water , oil , bread , and salt , and a little bacon , and the rest of the supper consisted of a piece of mutton , figs , a fresh cheese , and a loaf of rye bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had herself added a bottle of old mauves wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop' s face suddenly assumed the expression of gayety peculiar to hospitable natures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to table , -  he said eagerly , as he was wont to do when any stranger supped with him; and he bade the man sit down on his right hand , while mlle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistine , perfectly peaceful and natural , took her seat on his left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man began eating greedily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now it was the custom in this house , when the bishop had any one to supper , to arrange the whole stock of plate on the table , as an innocent display . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - between ourselves , this remark slightly offended me , but my brother answered ,<s> <s>  - they are harder worked than i am . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - no , -  the man continued ,  - they have more money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , if heaven were just you ought to be a cur . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - heaven is more than just , -  said my brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when the revolution ruined my family i sought shelter first in franche comt , and lived there for some time by the labor of my arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had a good will , and found plenty to do , as i need only choose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear sister , have we not some relatives in those parts?  - <s> <s>  - my answer was , ' we used to have some; among others monsieur de lucinet , who was captain of the gates at pontarlier , under the ancient rgime . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - yes , -  my brother continued ,  - but in ' 93 people had no relatives , but only their arms , and so i worked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the country to which you are going , monsieur valjean , there is a truly patriarchal and pleasing trade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear sister , i mean their cheese manufactures , which they call fruitires . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - then my brother , while pressing this man to eat , explained in their fullest details the fruitires of pontarlier , which were divided into two classesthe large farms which belong to the rich , and where there are forty or fifty cows , which produce seven to eight thousand cheeses in the summer , and the partnership fruitires , which belong to the poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the peasants of the central mountain district keep their cows in common and divide the produce . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have a cheese - maker , who is called the grurin; he receives the milk from the partners thrice a day , and enters the quantities in a book . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the man grew animated while eating , and my brother made him drink that excellent mauves wine , which he does not drink himself because he says that it is expensive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my brother gave him all these details with that easy gayety of his which you know , mingling his remarks with graceful appeals to myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he dwelt a good deal on the comfortable position of the grurin , as if wishful that this man should understand , without advising him directly and harshly , that it would be a refuge for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was apparently a good opportunity to give him a little lecture , and let the bishop produce a permanent effect on the galley - slave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my brother did not even ask him where he came from , or his history , for his fault is contained in his history , and my brother appeared to avoid everything which might call it to his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was carried to such a point that at a certain moment , when my brother was talking about the mountaineers of pontarlier , ' who had a pleasant task near heaven ,'  and who , he added , ' are happy because they are innocent ,'  he stopped short , fearing lest there might be in the remark something which might unpleasantly affect this man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after considerable reflection , i believe i can understand what was going on in my brother' s heart: he doubtless thought that this jean valjean had his misery ever present to his mind , that the best thing was to distract his attention , and make him believe , were it only momentarily , that he was a man like the rest , by behaving to him as he would to others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was not this really charity? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed to me that this might be my brother' s innermost thought: in any case , what i can safely say is , that if he had all these ideas , he did not let any of them be visible , even to me; he was from beginning to end the same man he is every night , and he supped with jean valjean with the same air and in the same way as if he had been supping with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gedeon le prevost , or with the parish curate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - toward the end , when we had come to the figs , there was a knock at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my brother kissed the child' s forehead , and borrowed from me 15 sous which i happened to have about me , to give them to the mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man , while this was going on , did not seem to pay great attention: he said nothing , and seemed very tired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when poor old mother gerbaud left , my brother said grace , and then said to this man: ' you must need your bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>'  madame magloire hastily removed the plate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i understood that we must retire in order to let this traveller sleep , and we both went up - stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i , however , sent madame magloire to lay on the man' s bed a roebuck' s hide from the black forest , which was in my room , for the nights are very cold , and that keeps you wann . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a pity that this skin is old and the hair is wearing off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame magloire came up again almost immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we said our prayers in the room where the clothes are hung up to dry , and then retired to our bed - rooms without saying a word to each other . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> after bidding his sister good - night , monseigneur welcome took up one of the silver candlesticks , handed the other to his guest , and said ,<s> <s>  - i will lead you to your room , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the reader will remember , from our description , that the rooms were so arranged that in order to reach the oratory where the alcove was it was necessary to pass through the bishop' s bed - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the moment when he went through this room madame magloire was putting away the plate in the cupboard over the bed - head: it was the last job she did every night before retiring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop led his guest to the alcove , where a clean bed was prepared for him; the man placed the branched candlestick on a small table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i trust you will pass a good night , -  said the bishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to - morrow morning , before starting , you will drink a glass of milk fresh from our cows . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - thank you , monsieur l' abb , -  the man said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had hardly uttered these peaceful words when , suddenly and without any transition , he had a strange emotion , which would have frightened the two old females to death had they witnessed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even at the present day it is difficult to account for what urged him at the moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did he wish to warn or to threaten? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was he simply obeying a species of instinctive impulse which was obscure to himself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he suddenly turned to the old gentleman , folded his arms , and , fixing on him a savage glance , he exclaimed hoarsely ,<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you really lodge me so close to you as that?  -  he broke off and added with a laugh , in which there was something monstrous ,<s> <s>  - have you reflected fully? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who tells you that i have not committed a murder?  - <s> <s> the bishop answered:  - that concerns god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the alcove was occupied , a large serge curtain drawn right across the oratory concealed the altar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop knelt down as he passed before this curtain , and offered up a short prayer; a moment after he was in his garden , walking , dreaming , contemplating , his soul and thoughts entirely occupied by those grand mysteries which god displays at night to eyes that remain open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the man , he was really so wearied that he did not even take advantage of the nice white sheets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he blew out the candle with his nostrils , after the fashion of convicts , and threw himself in his clothes upon the bed , where he at once fell into a deep sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> midnight was striking as the bishop returned from the garden to his room , and a few minutes later everybody was asleep in the small house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his childhood he had not been taught to read , and when he was of man' s age he was a wood - lopper at faverolles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean possessed a pensive but not melancholy character , which is peculiar to affectionate natures; but altogether he was a dull , insignificant fellow , at least apparently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that was left jean valjean was a sister older than himself , a widow with seven children , boys and girls . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this sister brought jean valjean up , and so long as her husband was alive she supported her brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was done simply as a duty , and even rather roughly by jean valjean; and his youth was thus expended in hard and ill - paid toil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was never known to have had a sweetheart , for he had no time for love - making . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at night he came home tired , and ate his soup without saying a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his sister , mother jeanne , while he was eating , often took out of his porringer the best part of his meal , the piece of meat , the slice of bacon , or the heart of the cabbage , to give it to one of her children; he , still eating , bent over the table with his head almost in the soup , and his long hair falling round his porringer and hiding his eyes , pretended not to see it , and let her do as she pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was at faverolles , not far from the valjeans'  cottage , on the other side of the lane , a farmer' s wife called marie claude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young valjeans , who were habitually starving , would go at times and borrow in their mother' s name a pint of milk from marie claude , which they drank behind a hedge or in some corner , tearing the vessel from each other so eagerly that the little girls spilt the milk over their aprons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their mother , had she been aware of this fraud , would have severely corrected the delinquents , but jean valjean , coarse and rough though he was , paid marie claude for the milk behind his sister' s back , and the children were not punished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he earned in the pruning season eighteen sous a day , and besides hired himself out as reaper , laborer , neat - herd , and odd man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did what he could; his sister worked too , but what could she do with seven children? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one winter was hard , and jean had no work to do , and the family had no bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no bread , literally none , and seven children! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one sunday evening , maubert isabeau , the baker in the church square at faverolles , was just going to bed when he heard a violent blow dealt the grating in front of his shop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole made by a fist through the grating and window pane; the arm seized a loaf , and carried it off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> isabeau ran out hastily; the thief ran away at his hardest , but the baker caught him and stopped him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thief had thrown away the loaf , but his arm was still bleeding; it was jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean was brought before the courts of the day , charged  - with burglary committed with violence at night , in an inhabited house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he had a gun , was a splendid shot , and a bit of a poacher , and this injured him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a legitimate prejudice against poachers , for , like smugglers , they trench very closely on brigandage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still we must remark that there is an abyss between these classes and the hideous assassins of our cities: the poacher lives in the forest; the smuggler in the mountains and on the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cities produce ferocious men , because they produce corrupted men; the forest , the mountain , and the sea produce savage men , but while they develop their ferocious side , they do not always destroy their human part . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean was found guilty , and the terms of the code were precise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are in our civilization formidable hours; they are those moments in which penal justice pronounces a shipwreck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a mournful minute is that in which society withdraws and consummates the irreparable abandonment of a thinking being! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean was sentenced to five years at the galleys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on april 22d , 1796 , men were crying in the streets of paris the victory of montenotte , gained by the general - in - chief of the army of italy , whom the message of the directory to the five hundred , of the 2 floral , year iv . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , calls buona - parte; and on the same day a heavy gang was put in chains at bicetre , and jean valjean formed part of the chain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was seated on the ground like the rest , and seemed not at all to understand his position , except that it was horrible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is probable that he also saw something excessive through the vague ideas of an utterly ignorant man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he started for toulon , and arrived there after a journey of twenty - seven days in a cart , with the chain on his neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at toulon he was dressed in the red jacket . </s> </s>

<s> <s> in the same house as the printing - office there was a day - school , to which she took the little boy , who was seven years of age , but as she went to work at six and the school did not open till seven o' clock , the boy was compelled to wait in the yard for an hour , in winter ,an hour of night in the open air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boy was not allowed to enter the printing - office , because it was said that he would be in the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the workmen as they passed in the morning saw the poor little fellow seated on the pavement , and often sleeping in the darkness , with his head on his satchel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when it rained , an old woman , the portress , took pity on him; she invited him into her den , where there were only a bed , a spinning - wheel , and two chairs , when the little fellow fell asleep in a corner , clinging to the cat , to keep him warm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is what jean valjean was told; it was a momentary flash , as it were a window suddenly opened in the destiny of the beings he had loved , and then all was closed again; he never heard about them more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing reached him from them; he never saw them again , never met them , and we shall not come across them in the course of this melancholy narrative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he escaped and wandered about the fields at liberty for two days: if it is liberty to be hunted down; to turn ones head at every moment; to start at the slightest sound; to be afraid of everything ,of a chimney that smokes , a man who passes , a barking dog , a galloping horse , the striking of the hour , of day because people see , of night because they do not see , of the highway , the path , the thicket , and even sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the evening of the second day he was recaptured; he had not eaten or slept for six - and - thirty hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the maritime tribunal added three years to his sentence for his crime , which made it eight years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the sixth year , it was again his turn to escape; he tried , but could not succeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> escape and rebellion: this fact , foreseen by the special code , was punished by an addition of five years , of which two would be spent in double chains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his tenth year his turn came again , and he took advantage of it , but succeeded no better: three years for this new attempt , or sixteen years in all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> finally , i think it was during his thirteenth year that he made a last attempt , and only succeeded so far as to be recaptured in four hours: three years for these four hours , and a total of nineteen years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in october , 1815 , he was liberated; he had gone in in 1796 for breaking a window and stealing a loaf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us make room for a short parenthesis . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is the second time that , during his essays on the penal question and condemnation by the law , the author of this book has come across a loaf as the starting point of the disaster of a destiny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claude gueux stole a loaf , and so did jean valjean , and english statistics prove that in london four robberies out of five have hunger as their immediate cause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean entered the bagne sobbing and shuddering: he left it stoically . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he entered it in despair: he came out of it gloomy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what had taken place in this soul? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> society must necessarily look at these things , because they are created by it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the natural light was kindled within him , and misfortune , which also has its brightness , increased the little daylight there was in this mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he constituted himself a court , and began by trying himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he recognized that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished; he confessed to himself that he had committed an extreme and blamable action; that the loaf would probably not have been refused him had he asked for it; that in any case it would have been better to wait for it , either from pity or from labor , and that it was not a thoroughly unanswerable argument to say ,  - can a man wait when he is hungry?  -  that , in the first place , it is very rare for a man to die literally of hunger; next , that , unhappily or happily , man is so made that he can suffer for a long time and severely , morally and physically , without dying; that hence he should have been patient; that it would have been better for the poor little children; that it was an act of madness for him , a wretched weak man , violently to collar society and to imagine that a man can escape from wretchedness by theft; that in any case the door by which a man enters infamy is a bad one by which to escape from wretchedness; and , in short , that he had been in the wrong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he asked himself if he were the only person who had been in the wrong in his fatal history? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether , next , when the fault was committed and confessed , the punishment had not been ferocious and excessive , and whether there were not more abuse on the side of the law in the penalty than there was on the side of the culprit in the crime? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether the excess of punishment were not the effacement of the crime , and led to the result of making a victim of the culprit , a creditor of the debtor , and definitively placing the right on the side of the man who had violated it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether this penalty , complicated by excessive aggravations for attempted escapes , did not eventually become a sort of attack made by the stronger on the weaker , a crime of society committed on the individual , a crime which was renewed every day , and had lasted for nineteen years? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked himself if human society could have the right to make its members equally undergo , on one side , its unreasonable improvidence , on the other its pitiless foresight , and to hold a man eternally between a want and an excess , want of work and excess of punishment? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether it were not exorbitant that society should treat thus its members who were worst endowed in that division of property which is made by chance , and consequently the most worthy of indulgence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these questions asked and solved , he passed sentence on society and condemned itto his hatred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made it responsible for the fate he underwent , and said to himself that he would not hesitate to call it to account some day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he declared that there was no equilibrium between the damage he had caused and the damage caused him; and he came to the conclusion that his punishment was not an injustice , but most assuredly an iniquity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wrath may be wild and absurd; a man may be wrongly irritated; but he is only indignant when he has some show of reason somewhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , again , human society had never done him aught but harm , he had only seen its wrathful face , which is called its justice , and shows itself to those whom it strikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men had only laid hands on him to injure him , and any contact with them had been a blow to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never , since his infancy , since his mother and his sister , had he heard a kind word or met a friendly look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was one of the number , and went to school at the age of forty , where he learned reading , writing , and arithmetic; he felt that strengthening his mind was strengthening his hatred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in certain cases , instruction and education may serve as allies to evil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is sad to say , that after trying society which had caused his misfortunes , he tried providence , who had made society , and condemned it also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hence , during these nineteen years of torture and slavery , this soul ascended and descended at the same time; light entered on one side and darkness on the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he condemned society then , and felt that he was growing wicked; he condemned providence , and felt that he was growing impious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here it is difficult not to meditate for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is human nature thus utterly transformed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can man , who is created good by god , be made bad by man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can the soul be entirely remade by destiny , and become evil if the destiny be evil? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these are grave and obscure questions , the last of which every physiologist would unhesitatingly have answered in the negative , had he seen at toulon , in those hours of repose which were for jean valjean hours of reverie , this gloomy , stern , silent , and pensive galley - slavethe pariah of the law which regarded men passionatelythe condemned of civilization , who regarded heaven with severityseated with folded arms on a capstan bar , with the end of his chain thrust into his pocket to prevent it from dragging . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we assuredly do not deny that the physiological observer would have seen there an irremediable misery; he would probably have pitied this patient of the law , but he would not have even attempted a cure: he would have turned away from the caverns he noticed in this soul , and , like dante at the gates of the inferno , he would have effaced from this existence that word which god , however , has written on the brow of every man: hope! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was this state of his soul , which we have attempted to analyze , as perfectly clear to jean valjean as we have tried to render it to our readers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had this rude and unlettered man clearly comprehended the succession of ideas by which he had step by step ascended and descended to the gloomy views which had for so many years been the inner horizon of his mind? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this we should not like to assert , and , indeed , we are not inclined to believe it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was too much ignorance in jean valjean for a considerable amount of vagueness not to remain , even after so much misfortune; at times he did not even know exactly what he experienced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean was in darkness; he suffered in darkness , and he hated in darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he lived habitually in this shadow , groping like a blind man and a dreamer; at times he was attacked , both internally and externally , by a shock of passion , a surcharge of suffering , a pale and rapid flash which illumined his whole soul , and suddenly made him see all around , both before and behind him , in the glare of a frightful light , the hideous precipices and gloomy perspective of his destiny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the flash had passed , night encompassed him again , and where was he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he no longer knew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the peculiarity of punishments of this nature , in which nought but what is pitiless , that is to say brutalizing , prevails , is gradually , and by a species of stupid transfiguration , to transform a man into a wild beast , at times a ferocious beast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one fact we must not omit mentioning is that he possessed a physical strength with which no one in the bagne could compete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in turning a capstan , jean valjean was equal to four men; he frequently raised and held on his back enormous weights , and took the place at times of that instrument which is called a jack , and was formerly called orgueil , from which , by the way , the rue montorgueil derived its name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once when the balcony of the town hall at toulon was being repaired , one of those admirable caryatides of puget' s which support the balcony , became loose and almost fell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean , who was on the spot , supported the statue with his shoulder , and thus gave the workmen time to come up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his suppleness even exceeded his vigor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some convicts , who perpetually dream of escaping , eventually make a real science of combined skill and strength; it is the science of the muscles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a full course of mysterious statics is daily practised by the prisoners , those eternal enviers of flies and birds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> swarming up a perpendicular , and finding a resting - place where a projection is scarcely visible , was child' s play for jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> given a corner of a wall , with the tension of his back and hams , with his elbows and heels clinging to the rough stone , he would hoist himself as if by magic to a third story , and at times would ascend to the very roof of the bagne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to look at him , he seemed engaged in continually gazing at something terrible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was , in fact , absorbed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> through the sickly perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed intellect , he saw confusedly that a monstrous thing was hanging over him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this obscure and dull gloom through which he crawled , wherever he turned his head and essayed to raise his eye , he saw , with a terror blended with rage , built up above him , with frightfully scarped sides , a species of terrific pile of things , laws , prejudices , men , and facts , whose outline escaped him , whose mass terrified him , and which was nothing else but that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed to him as if this distant splendor , far from dissipating his night , only rendered it more gloomy and black . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all these laws , prejudices , facts , men , and things , came and went above him , in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which god imprints on civilization , marching over him , and crushing him with something painful in its cruelty and inexorable in its indiffrence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> souls which have fallen into the abyss of possible misfortune , hapless men lost in the depths of those limbos into which people no longer look , and the reprobates of the law , feel on their heads the whole weight of the human society which is so formidable for those outside it , so terrific for those beneath it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this situation , jean valjean thought , and what could be the nature of his reverie? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if the grain of corn had its thoughts , when ground by the mill - stone , it would doubtless think as did jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all these things , realities full of spectres , phantasmagorias full of reality , ended by creating for him a sort of internal condition which is almost inexpressible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at times , in the midst of his galley - slave toil , he stopped and began thinking; his reason , at once riper and more troubled than of yore , revolted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that had happened appeared to him absurd; all that surrounded him seemed to him impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> visible nature scarce existed for him; we might almost say with truth , that for jean valjean there was no sun , no glorious summer - day , no brilliant sky , no fresh april dawn; we cannot describe the gloomy light which illumined his soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in conclusion , to sum up all that can be summed up in what we have indicated , we will confine ourselves to establishing the fact that in nineteen years , jean valjean , the inoffensive wood - cutter of faverolles , and the formidable galley - slave of toulon , had become , thanks to the manner in which the bagne had fashioned him , capable of two sorts of bad actions: first , a rapid , unreflecting bad deed , entirely instinctive , and a species of reprisal for the evil he had suffered; and , secondly , of a grave , serious evil deed , discussed conscientiously and meditated with the false ideas which such a misfortune can produce . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his premeditations passed through the three successive phases which natures of a certain temperament can alone undergo ,reasoning , will , and obstinacy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the starting - point , like the goal , of all his thoughts , was hatred of human law; that hatred , which , if it be not arrested in its development by some providential incident , becomes within a given time a hatred of society , then a hatred of the human race , next a hatred of creation , and which is expressed by a vague , incessant , and brutal desire to injure some one , no matter whom . </s> </s>

<s> <s> all this water seems to be hate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he tries to save himself , to keep himself up; he strikes out , he swims . </s> </s>

<s> <s> where is the ship now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> way down there , barely visible in the pale obscurity of the horizon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the squalls hum about him , the wave - crests wash over him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> night falls; he has been swimming now for hours; his strength has reached its end; this ship , this far - off thing where there were men , is blotted from his sight; he is alone in the fearful gulf of twilight; he sinks , he braces himself , he writhes , he feels below him the roving monsters of the invisible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there are no longer any men here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he implores the waste of waters , the wave , the seaweed , the rock; it is deaf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he supplicates the tempest; the pitiless tempest obeys only the infinite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> around him is darkness , mist , solitude , the stormy and unreasoning tumult , the boundless rolling of the wild waters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> under him the abyss . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is nothing to rest on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thinks of what will happen to his body in the boundless shades . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the infinite cold benumbs him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his hands shrivel; they clutch and find nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is he to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> worn out as he is , he makes up his mind to die , he abandons himself , he lets himself go , he relaxes himself , and there he is rolling forever into the dismal depths in which he is swallowed up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , implacable course of human society! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a loss of men and of souls on the way! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ocean into which falls all that the law lets fall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wicked vanishing of help! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , moral death! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who will bring it to life again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the hour for quitting the bagne arrived , when jean valjean heard in his ear the unfamiliar words  - you are free , -  the moment seemed improbable and extraordinary , and a ray of bright light , of the light of the living , penetrated to him; but it soon grew pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty , and had believed in a new life , but he soon saw that it is a liberty to which a yellow passport is granted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and around this there was much bitterness; he had calculated that his earnings , during his stay at the bagne , should have amounted to 171 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not understand it all , and fancied that he had been robbed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he set to work; he was intelligent , powerful , and skilful , and his master appeared satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was at work a gendarme passed , noticed him , asked for his paper , and he was compelled to show his yellow pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a little while previously he had asked one of the workmen what he earned for his day' s work , and the answer was 30 sous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> liberation is not deliverance; a man may leave the bagne , but not condemnation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have seen what happened to him at grasse , and we know how he was treated at d . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what aroused him was that the bed was too comfortable , for close on twenty years he had not slept in a bed , and though he had not undressed , the sensation was too novel not to disturb his sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had been asleep for more than four hours , and his weariness had worn off; and he was accustomed not to grant many hours to repose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he opened his eyes and looked into the surrounding darkness , and then he closed them again to go to sleep once more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when many diverse sensations have agitated a day , and when matters preoccupy the mind , a man may sleep , but he cannot go to sleep again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sleep comes more easily than it returns , and this happened to jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he could not go to sleep again , he began thinking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was one of those moments in which the ideas that occupy the mind are troubled , and there was a species of obscure oscillation in his brain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his old recollections and immediate recollections crossed each other , and floated confusedly , losing their shape , growing enormously , and then disappearing suddenly , as if in troubled and muddy water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many thoughts occurred to him , but there was one which constantly reverted and expelled all the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this thought we will at once describe; he had noticed the six silver forks and spoons and the great ladle which madame magloire put on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his mind oscillated for a good hour , in these fluctuations with which a struggle was most assuredly blended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when three o' clock struck he opened his eyes , suddenly sat up , stretched out his arms , and felt for his knapsack which he had thrown into a corner of the alcove , then let his legs hang , and felt himself seated on the bed - side almost without knowing how . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained for a while thoughtfully in this attitude , which would have had something sinister about it , for any one who had seen him , the only wakeful person in the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all at once he stooped , took off his shoes , then resumed his thoughtful posture , and remained motionless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the midst of this hideous meditation , the ideas which we have indicated incessantly crossed his brain , entered , went out , returned , and weighed upon him; and then he thought , without knowing why , and with the mechanical obstinacy of reverie , of a convict he had known at the bagne , of the name of brevet , whose trousers were only held up by a single knitted brace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he rose , hesitated for a moment and listened; all was silent in the house , and he went on tip - toe to the window , through which he peered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the night was not very dark; there was a full moon , across which heavy clouds were chased by the wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on reaching the window , jean valjean examined it; it was without bars , looked on the garden , and was only closed , according to the fashion of the country , by a small peg . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he opened it , but as a cold sharp breeze suddenly entered the room , he closed it again directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he gazed into the garden with that attentive glance which studies rather than looks , and found that it was enclosed by a white - washed wall , easy to climb over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beyond it he noticed the tops of trees standing at regular distances , which proved that this wall separated the garden from a public walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after taking this glance , he walked boldly to the alcove , opened his knapsack , took out something which he laid on the bed , put his shoes in one of the pouches , placed the knapsack on his shoulders , put on his cap , the peak of which he pulled over his eyes , groped for his stick , which he placed in the window nook , and then returned to the bed , and took up the object he had laid on it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would have been difficult to distinguish in the darkness for what purpose this piece of iron had been fashioned; perhaps it was a lever , perhaps it was a club . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by daylight it could have been seen that it was nothing but a miners candlestick . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the convicts at that day were sometimes employed in extracting rock from the lofty hills that surround toulon , and it was not infrequent for them to have mining tools at their disposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the miner' s candlesticks are made of massive steel , and have a point at the lower end , by which they are dug into the rock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took the bar in his right hand , and holding his breath and deadening his footsteps he walked towards the door of the adjoining room , the bishop' s as we know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean listened , but there was not a sound; he pushed the door with the tip of his finger lightly , and with the furtive restless gentleness of a cat that wants to get in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door yielded to the pressure , and made an almost imperceptible and silent movement , which slightly widened the opening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he waited for a moment , and then pushed the door again more boldly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it continued to yield silently , and the opening was soon large enough for him to pass through . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but there was near the door a small table which formed an awkward angle with it , and barred the entrance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made up his mind , and pushed the door a third time , more energetically still . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time there was a badly - oiled hinge , which suddenly uttered a hoarse prolonged cry in the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean started; the sound of the hinge smote his ear startlingly and formidably , as if it had been the trumpet of the day of judgment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the fantastic exaggerations of the first minute , he almost imagined that this hinge had become animated , and suddenly obtained a terrible vitality and barked like a dog to warn and awaken the sleepers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stopped , shuddering and dismayed , and fell back from tip - toes on his heels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fancied that the horrible clamor of this irritated hinge must have startled the whole house like the shock of an earthquake; the door he opened had been alarmed and cried for help; the old man would rise , the two aged females would shriek , and assistance would arrive within a quarter of an hour , the town would be astir , and the gendarmerie turned out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a moment he believed himself lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained where he was , petrified like the pillar of salt , and not daring to make a movement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few minutes passed , during which the door remained wide open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he ventured to look into the room , and found that nothing had stirred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he listened; no one was moving in the house , the creaking of the rusty hinge had not awakened any one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first danger had passed , but still there was fearful tumult within him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he did not recoil , he had not done so even when he thought himself lost; he only thought of finishing the job as speedily as possible , and entered the bed - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the room was in a state of perfect calmness; here and there might be distinguished confused and vague forms , which by day were papers scattered over the table , open folios , books piled on a sofa , an easy - chair covered with clothes , and a priedieu , all of which were at this moment only dark nooks and patches of white . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean advanced cautiously and carefully , and avoided coming into collision with the furniture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he heard from the end of the room the calm and regular breathing of the sleeping bishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nature at times blends her effects and scenes with our actions , with a species of gloomy and intelligent design , as if wishing to make us reflect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for nearly half an hour a heavy cloud had covered the sky , but at the moment when jean valjean stopped at the foot of the bed , this cloud was rent asunder as if expressly , and a moonbeam passing through the tall window suddenly illumined the bishop' s pale face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was sleeping peacefully , and was wrapped up in a long garment of brown wool , which covered his arms down to the wrists . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had on his forehead the inexpressible reflection of an invisible light , for the soul of a just man contemplates a mysterious heaven during sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a reflection of this heaven was cast over the bishop , but it was at the same time a luminous transparency , for the heaven was within him , and was conscience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the moment when the moonbeam was cast over this internal light , the sleeping bishop seemed to be surrounded by a glory , which was veiled , however , by an ineffable semi - light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moon in the heavens , the slumbering landscape , the quiet house , the hour , the silence , the moment , added something solemn and indescribable to this man' s venerable repose , and cast a majestic and serene halo round his white hair and closed eyes , his face in which all was hope and confidence , his aged head , and his infantine slumbers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean was standing in the shadow with his crow - bar in his hand , motionless and terrified by this luminous old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moral world has no greater spectacle than this ,a troubled , restless conscience , which is on the point of committing a bad action , contemplating the sleep of a just man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this sleep in such isolation , and with a neighbor like himself , possessed a species of sublimity which he felt vaguely , but imperiously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one could have said what was going on within him , not even himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even in his face nothing could have been distinguished with certainty , for it displayed a sort of haggard astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he looked at the bishop , that was all , but what his thoughts were it would be impossible to divine; what was evident was , that he was moved and shaken , but of what nature was this emotion? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his eye was not once removed from the old man , and the only thing clearly revealed by his attitude and countenance was a strange indecision . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed as if he were hesitating between two abysses , the one that saves and the one that destroys; he was ready to dash out the bishop' s brains or kiss his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a moonbeam rendered the crucifix over the mantel - piece dimly visible , which seemed to open its arms for both , with a blessing for one and a pardon for the other . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - monseigneur , monseigneur!  -  she screamed ,  - does your grandeur know where the plate - basket is?  - <s> <s>  - yes , -  said the bishop . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower - bed , and now handed it to madame magloire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here it is , -  he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well!  -  she said ,  - there is nothing in it; where is the plate?  - <s> <s>  - ah!  -  the bishop replied ,  - it is the plate that troubles your mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , i do not know where that is . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - good lord! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is stolen , and that man who came last night is the robber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was stooping down and looking sorrowfully at a cochlearia , whose stem the basket had broken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he raised himself on hearing madame magloire scream ,<s> <s>  - monseigneur , the man has gone! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the plate is stolen!  - <s> <s> while uttering this exclamation her eyes fell on a corner of the garden , where there were signs of climbing; the coping of the wall had been torn away . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he leaped into cochefilet lane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , what an outrage! </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> the bishop remained silent for a moment , then raised his earnest eyes , and said gently to madame magloire ,<s> <s>  - by the way , was that plate ours?  - <s> <s> madame magloire was speechless; there was another interval of silence , after which the bishop continued ,<s> <s>  - madame magloire , i had wrongfully held back this silver , which belonged to the poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who was this person? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> evidently a poor man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , are there not pewter forks to be had?  - <s> <s> madame magloire shrugged her shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pewter smells!  - <s> <s>  - then iron!  - <s> <s> madame magloire made an expressive grimace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - iron tastes . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - well , then , -  said the bishop ,  - wood!  - <s> <s> a few minutes later he was breakfasting at the same table at which jean valjean sat on the previous evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what an idea!  -  madame magloire said , as she went backwards and forwards ,  - to receive a man like that , and lodge him by one' s side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , lord! </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> as the brother and sister were leaving the table there was a knock at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come in , -  said the bishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door opened , and a strange and violent group appeared on the threshold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the three men were gendarmes , the fourth was jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monseigneur , -  he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this word jean valjean , who was gloomy and crushed , raised his head with a stupefied air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ' monseigneur ,'  -  he muttered;  - then he is not the cur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this gentleman is monseigneur the bishop . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> in the mean while monseigneur welcome had advanced as rapidly as his great age permitted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there you are , -  he said , looking at jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am glad to see you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , i gave you the candlesticks too , which are also silver , and will fetch you 200 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why did you not take them away with the rest of the plate?  - <s> <s> jean valjean opened his eyes , and looked at the bishop with an expression which no human language could render . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monseigneur , -  the corporal said;  - what this man told us was true then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we met him , and as he looked as if he were running away , we arrested him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had this plate - <s> <s>  - and he told you , -  the bishop interrupted , with a smile ,  - that it was given to him by an old priest at whose house he passed the night? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i see it all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is a mistake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , you are let go; don' t you understand?  -  said a gendarme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friend , -  the bishop continued ,  - before you go take your candlesticks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two females watched him do so without a word , without a sign , without a look that could disturb the bishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean was trembling in all his limbs; he took the candlesticks mechanically , and with wandering looks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , -  said the bishop ,  - go in peace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the bye , when you return , my friend , it is unnecessary to pass through the garden , for you can always enter , day and night , by the front door , which is only latched . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> jean valjean , who had no recollection of having promised anything , stood silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bishop , who had laid a stress on these words , continued solemnly ,<s> <s>  - jean valjean , my brother , you no longer belong to evil , but to good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have bought your soul of you . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> jean valjean left the town as if running away; he walked hastily across the fields , taking the roads and paths that offered themselves , without perceiving that he was going round and round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wandered thus the entire morning , and though he had eaten nothing , he did not feel hungry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was attacked by a multitude of novel sensations; he felt a sort of passion , but he did not know with whom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not have said whether he was affected or humiliated; at times a strange softening came over him , against which he strove , and to which he opposed the hardening of the last twenty years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked himself what would take its place; at times he would have preferred being in prison and with the gendarmes , and that things had not happened thus; for that would have agitated him less . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although the season was advanced , there were still here and there in the hedges a few laggard flowers , whose smell recalled childhood' s memories as he passed them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these recollections were almost unendurable , for it was so long since they had recurred to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the sun was setting , and lengthening on the ground the shadow of the smallest pebble , jean valjean was sitting behind a bush in a large tawny and utterly - deserted plain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean might be about three leagues from d , and a path that crossed the plain ran a few paces from the bushes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned his head and saw a little savoyard about ten years of age coming along the path , with his hurdy - gurdy at his side and his dormouse - box on his back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lad stopped by the side of the bushes without seeing jean valjean , and threw up the handful of sous , all of which he had hitherto always caught on the back of his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was an utterly deserted spot; as far as eye could extend there was no one on the plain or the path . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing was audible , save the faint cries of a swarm of birds of passage passing through the sky , at an immense height . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , -  the little savoyard said , with that childish confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence ,  - my coin?  - <s> <s>  - what is your name?  -  jean valjean said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - little gervais , sir . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> jean valjean' s eye remained fixed on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my coin , -  the boy cried ,  - my silver piece , my money . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> it seemed as if jean valjean did not hear him , for the boy seized the collar of his blouse and shook him , and at the same time made an effort to remove the iron - shod shoe placed on his coin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was still sitting on the ground , and his eyes were misty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he looked at the lad with a sort of amazement , then stretched forth his hand to his stick , and shouted in a terrible voice ,  - who is there?  - <s> <s>  - i , sir , -  the boy replied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - little gervais; give me back my two francs , if you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , when he had got a certain distance , want of breath forced him to stop , and jean valjean could hear him sobbing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a few minutes the boy had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sun had set , and darkness collected around jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had eaten nothing all day , and was probably in a fever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had remained standing and not changed his attitude since the boy ran off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his breath heaved his chest at long and unequal intervals , his eye , fixed ten or twelve yards ahead , seemed to be studying with profound attention the shape of an old fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly he started , for he felt the night chill; he pulled his cap over his forehead , mechanically tried to cross and button his blouse , made a step , and stooped to pick up his stick . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment he perceived the two - franc piece , which his foot had half buried in the turf , and which glistened among the pebbles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it had the effect of a galvanic shock upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is this?  -  he muttered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fell back three paces , then stopped , unable to take his eye from the spot his foot had trodden a moment before , as if the thing glistening there in the darkness had an open eye fixed upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a few moments he dashed convulsively at the coin , picked it up , and began looking out into the plain , while shuddering like a straying wild beast which is seeking shelter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw nothing , night was falling , the plain was cold and indistinct , and heavy purple mists rose in the twilight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the country was deserted and gloomy , and he was surrounded by space . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was nothing but a gloom in which his gaze was lost , and a stillness in which his voice was lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an icy breeze was blowing , and imparted to things around a sort of mournful life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bushes shook their little thin arms with incredible fury; they seemed to be threatening and pursuing some one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a lad of the name of ' little gervais? '  - <s> <s>  - i have seen nobody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur le cur , this is for your poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a boy of about ten years of age , with a dormouse , i think , and a hurdy - gurdy ,a savoyard , you know . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i did not see him . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - can you tell me if there is any one of the name of little gervais in the villages about here?  - <s> <s>  - if it is as you say , my good fellow , the lad is a stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many of them pass this way . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> jean valjean violently took out two other five - franc pieces , which he gave the priest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for your poor , -  he said; then added wildly ,  - monsieur l' abb , have me arrested: i am a robber . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the priest urged on his horse , and rode away in great alarm , while jean valjean set off running in the direction he had first taken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twice or thrice he ran across the plain to something that appeared to him to be a person lying or sitting down; but he only found heather , or rocks level with the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he stopped at a spot where three paths met; the moon had risen; he gazed afar , and called out for the last time ,  - little gervais , little gervais , little gervais!  -  his shout died away in the mist , without even awakening an echo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he muttered again ,  - little gervais , -  in a weak and almost inarticulate voice , but it was his last effort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his knees suddenly gave way under him as if an invisible power were crushing him beneath the weight of a bad conscience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fell exhausted on a large stone , with his hand tearing his hair , his face between his knees , and shrieked:  - i am a scoundrel!  -  then his heart melted , and he began to weep; it was the first time for nineteen years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when jean valjean quitted the bishop' s house he was lifted out of his former thoughts , and could not account for what was going on within him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stiffened himself against the angelic deeds and gentle words of the old man:  - you have promised me to become an honest man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i purchase your soul; i withdraw it from the spirit of perverseness and give it to god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  this incessantly recurred to him , and he opposed to this celestial indulgence that pride which is within us as the fortress of evil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt indistinctly that this priest' s forgiveness was the greatest and most formidable assault by which he had yet been shaken; that his hardening would be permanent if he resisted this clemency; that if he yielded he must renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul during so many years , and which pleased him; that this time he must either conquer or be vanquished , and that the struggle , a colossal and final struggle , had begun between his wickedness and that man' s goodness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the presence of all these gleams he walked on like a drunken man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he went on thus with haggard eye , had he any distinct perception of what the result of his adventure at d might be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just gone through the solemn hour of his destiny , that no middle way was now left him , and that if he were not henceforth the best of men he would be the worst; that he must now ascend higher than the bishop , or sink lower than the galley - slave; that if he wished to be good he must become an angel , and if he wished to remain wicked that he must become a monster? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here we must ask again the question we previously asked , did he confusedly receive any shadow of all this into his mind? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> assuredly , as we said , misfortune educates the intellect , still it is doubtful whether jean valjean was in a state to draw the conclusions we have formed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on leaving that shapeless black thing which is called the bagne the bishop had hurt his soul , in the same way as a too brilliant light would have hurt his eyes on coming out of darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the future life , the possible life , which presented itself to him , all pure and radiant , filled him with tremor and anxiety , and he really no longer knew how matters were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one thing which he did not suspect is certain , however , that he was no longer the same man; all was changed in him , and it was no longer in his power to get rid of the fact that the bishop had spoken to him and taken his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was so , and was perhaps also even less than that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the intellect woke again and saw this brutish action , jean valjean recoiled with agony and uttered a cry of horror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a curious phenomenon , and one only possible in his situation , that , in robbing the boy of that money , he committed a deed of which he was no longer capable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however this may be , this last bad action had a decisive effect upon him: it suddenly darted through the chaos which filled his mind and dissipated it , placed on one side the dark mists , on the other the light , and acted on his soul , in its present condition , as certain chemical re - agents act upon a troubled mixture , by precipitating one element and clarifying another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at first , before even examining himself or reflecting , he wildly strove to find the boy again and return him his money; then , when he perceived that this was useless and impossible , he stopped in despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the moment when he exclaimed ,  - i am a scoundrel!  -  he had seen himself as he really was , and was already so separated from himself that he fancied himself merely a phantom , and that he had there before him , in flesh and blood , his blouse fastened round his hips , his knapsack full of stolen objects on his back , with his resolute and gloomy face and his mind full of hideous schemes , the frightful galley - slave , jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his brain was in that violent and yet frightfully calm stage when the reverie is so deep that it absorbs reality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on looking more attentively at this light which appeared to his conscience , he perceived that it had a human shape and was the bishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his conscience examined in turn the two men standing before him , the bishop and jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by one of those singular effects peculiar to an ecstasy of this nature , the more his reverie was prolonged , the taller and more brilliant the bishop appeared , while jean valjean grew less and faded out of sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length he disappeared and the bishop alone remained , who filled the wretched man' s soul with a magnificent radiance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean wept for a long time , and sobbed with more weakness than a woman , more terror than a child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he wept the light grew brighter in his brain ,an extraordinary light , at once ravishing and terrible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still a soft light was shed over both , and he fancied that he saw satan by the light of paradise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how many hours did he weep thus? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what did he do afterwards? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one ever knew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was stated , however , that on this very night the mail carrier from grenoble , who arrived at d at about three o' clock in the morning , while passing through the street where the bishop' s palace stood , saw a man kneeling on the pavement in the attitude of prayer in front of monseigneur welcome' s door . </s> </s>

<s> <s> these young men were insignificant , four every - day specimens , neither good nor bad , wise nor ignorant , geniuses nor idiots , and handsome with that charming aprilia which is called twenty years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were four oscars , for at that period arthurs did not yet exist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - burn for him the perfumes of arabia , -  the romance said;  - oscar is advancing , i am about to see him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  people had just emerged from ossian: the elegant world was scandinavian and caledonian , the english style was not destined to prevail till a later date , and the first of the arthurs , wellington , had only just won the battle of waterloo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the names of these oscars were flix tholomys , of toulouse; listolier , of cahors; fameuil , of limoges; and blachevelle , of montauban . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had not entirely laid down the needle , and though unsettled by their amourettes , they still had in their faces a remnant of the serenity of toil , and in their souls that flower of honesty , which in a woman survives the first fall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the four was called the young one , because she was the youngest , and one called the old one , who was only three - and - twenty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to conceal nothing , the three first were more experienced , more reckless , and had flown further into the noise of life than fantine the blonde , who was still occupied with her first illusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dahlia , zphine , and especially favourite , could not have said the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was already more than one episode in their scarce - begun romance , and the lover who was called adolphe in the first chapter , became alphonse in the second , and gustave in the third . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are crushed with the splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what if the jungfrau had hunger? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> favourite , who had been to england , was admired by zphine and dahlia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had a home of her own from an early age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her father was an old brutal and boasting professor of mathematics , unmarried , and still giving lessons in spite of his age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this professor , when a young man , had one day seen a lady' s maid' s gown caught in a fender; he fell in love with this accident , and favourite was the result . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one morning , an old woman with a hypocritical look came into her room and said ,  - do you not know me , miss?  -   - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -   - i am your mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  then the old woman opened the cupboard , ate and drank , sent for a mattress she had , and installed herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this mother , who was grumbling and proud , never spoke to favourite , sat for hours without saying a word , breakfasted , dined , and supped for half a dozen , and spent her evenings in the porter' s lodge , where she abused her daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what drew dahlia toward listolier , towards others perhaps , towards idleness , was having too pretty pink nails . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how could she employ such nails in working? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a girl who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for zphine , she had conquered fameuil by her little saucy and coaxing way of saying  - yes , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such amours are always doubled by such friendships . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a sage and a philosopher are two persons; and what proves it is that , after making all reservations for these little irregular households , favourite , zphine , and dahlia were philosophic girls , and fantine a prudent girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> solomon would reply , that love forms part of wisdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we confine ourselves to saying that fantine' s love was a first love , a single love , a faithful love . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she had never known either father or mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she called herself fantine , and why fantine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had no family name , as she had no family; and no christian name , as the church was abolished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she accepted the name given her by the first passer - by , who saw her running barefooted about the streets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was called little fantine , and no one knew any more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this human creature came into the world in that way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the age of ten , fantine left the town , and went into service with farmers in the neighborhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  fantine was pretty and remained pure as long as she could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she loved tholomys; it was a pastime for him , but a passion with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine , in the labyrinth of the pantheon hill , where so many adventures are fastened and unfastened , long shunned tholomys , but in such a way as to meet him constantly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> blachevelle , listolier , and fameuil formed a sort of group , of which tholomys was the head , for it was he who had the wit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tholomys was the antique old student; he was rich , for he had an income of 4000 francs a year , a splendid scandal on the montagne st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was wrinkled and had lost teeth , and he had an incipient baldness , of which he himself said without sorrow:  - the skull at thirty , the knee at forty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he had but a poor digestion , and one of his eyes was permanently watery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in proportion as his youth was extinguished , his gayety became brighter; he substituted jests for his teeth , joy for his hair , irony for his health , and his weeping eye laughed incessantly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was battered , but still flowering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his youth had beaten an orderly retreat , and only the fire was visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had had a piece refused at the vaudeville theatre , and wrote occasional verses now and then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in addition , he doubted everything in a superior way , which is a great strength in the eyes of the weak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hence , being ironical and bald , he was the leader . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we wonder whether irony , is derived from the english word  - iron - ? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day tholomys took the other three aside , made an oracular gesture , and said ,<s> <s>  - it is nearly a year that fantine , dahlia , zphine , and favorite have been asking us to give them a surprise , and we promised solemnly to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the same way as the old women of naples cry to saint januarius ,  - yellow face , perform your miracle!  -  our beauties incessantly say to me ,  - tholomys , when will you be delivered of your surprise?  -  at the same time our parents are writing to us , so let us kill two birds with one stone . </s> </s>

<s> <s> let us suppose that i am a traveller and say to the guard of the stage - coach ,  - i will walk on and you can pick me up on the quay as you pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is done every day; you are ignorant of life , my dear . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> some time elapsed; all at once favourite started as if waking from sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , -  she said ,  - where is the surprise?  - <s> <s>  - oh yes , -  dahlia continued ,  - the famous surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just as fantine had ended this sigh , the waiter who had served the dinner came in; he held in his hand something that resembled a letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is that?  -  favourite asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the waiter answered ,<s> <s>  - it is a paper which the gentlemen left for you , ladies . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - why did you not bring it to us at once?  - <s> <s>  - because the gentlemen , -  the waiter went on ,  - ordered that it should not be delivered to you for an hour . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> favourite snatched the paper from the waiter' s hands; it was really a letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well - beloved ,know that we have relatives: perhaps you are not perfectly cognizant what they are; it means fathers and mothers in the civil , puerile , and honest code . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , these relatives are groaning; these old people claim us as their own; these worthy men and women call us prodigal sons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they desire our return home , and offer to kill the fatted calf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we obey them , as we are virtuous; at the hour when you read this , five impetuous steeds will be conveying us back to our papas and mammas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  we are flying away in the arms of laffitte and on the wings of gaillard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are re - entering society , duty , and order , at a sharp trot , and at the rate of nine miles an hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is important for our country that we should become , like everybody else , prefects , fathers of a family , game - keepers , and councillors of state . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> revere us , for we are sacrificing ourselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dry up your tears for us rapidly , and get a substitute speedily . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the dinner is paid for . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the four girls looked at each other , and favourite was the first to break the silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don' t care , -  she said ,  - it is a capital joke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so soon as he has left me i am beginning to grow fond of him; the old story . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - no , -  said dahlia ,  - that is an idea of tholomys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that can be easily seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> over the door a board was nailed to the wall , and on this board was painted something resembling a man carrying on his back another man , who wore large gilt general' s epaulettes with silver stars; red dabs represented blood , and the rest of the painting was smoke , probably representing a battle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the bottom could be read the inscription: the sergeant of waterloo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though nothing is more common than a cart at a pot - house door , the vehicle , or rather fragment of a vehicle , which blocked up the street in front of the sergeant of waterloo , one spring evening in 1818 , would have certainly attracted the attention of any painter who had passed that way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the forepart of one of those wains used in wood countries for dragging planks and trunks of trees; it was composed of a massive iron axle - tree , in which a heavy pole was imbedded and supported by two enormous wheels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole thing was sturdy , crushing , and ugly , and it might have passed for the carriage of a monster gun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ruts had given the wheels , felloes , spokes , axle - tree , and pole a coating of mud , a hideous yellow plaster , much like that with which cathedrals are so often adorned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> under the axle - tree was festooned a heavy chain suited for a convict goliath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this chain made you think , not of the wood it was intended to secure , but of the mastodons and mammoths for which it would have served as harness; it had the air of a cyclopean and superhuman bagne , and seemed removed from some monster . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> homer would have bound polyphemus with it , and shakespeare , caliban . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why was this thing at this place in the street? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first , to block it up; secondly , to finish the rusting process . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is in the old social order a multitude of institutions which may be found in the same way in the open air , and which have no other reasons for being there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the centre of the chain hung rather close to the ground , and on the curve , as on the rope of a swing , two little girls were seated on this evening , in an exquisite embrace , one about two years and a half , the other eighteen months; the younger being in the arms of the elder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an artfully - tied handkerchief prevented them from falling , for a mother had seen this frightful chain , and said ,  - what a famous plaything for my children!  -  the two children , who were prettily dressed and with some taste , were radiant; they looked like two roses among old iron; their eyes were a triumph , their healthy cheeks laughed; one had auburn hair , the other was a brunette; their innocent faces had a look of surprise; a flowering shrub a little distance off sent to passers - by a perfume which seemed to come from them; and the younger displayed her nudity with the chaste indecency of childhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> above and around their two delicate heads , moulded in happiness and bathed in light , the gigantic wheels , black with rust , almost terrible , and bristling with curves and savage angles , formed the porch of a cavern , as it were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few yards off , and seated in the inn door , the mother , a woman of no very pleasing appearance , but touching at this moment , was swinging the children by the help of a long cord , and devouring them with her eyes , for fear of an accident , with that animal and heavenly expression peculiar to maternity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at each oscillation the hideous links produced a sharp sound , resembling a cry of anger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little girls were delighted; the setting sun mingled with the joy , and nothing could be so charming as this caprice of accident which had made of a titanic chain a cherub' s swing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while playing with her little ones , the mother sang , terribly out of tune , a romance , very celebrated at that day ,<s> <s>  - il le faut , disait un guerrier . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> her song and contemplation of her daughters prevented her hearing and seeing what took place in the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some one , however , had approached her , as she began the first couplets of the romance , and suddenly she heard a voice saying close to her ear ,<s> <s>  - you have two pretty children , madame . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  -  la belle et tendre imogne , - <s> <s> the mother answered , continuing her song , and then turned her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a woman was standing a few paces from her , who also had a child , which she was carrying in her arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she also carried a heavy bag . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had on a hood of fine linen , ribbons at her shoulders , and valenciennes lace in her cap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her raised petticoats displayed her white , dimpled , fine thigh; it was admirably pink and healthy , and her cheeks made one long to bite them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing could be said of her eyes , except that they were very large , and that she had magnificent lashes , for she was asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the mother , she looked grave and sorrowful , and was dressed like a work - girl who was trying to become a country - woman again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was young; was she pretty? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps so; but in this dress she did not appear so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her eyes looked as if they had not been dry for a long time; she had a fatigued and rather sickly air , and she looked at the child sleeping in her arms in the manner peculiar to a mother who has suckled her babe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a large blue handkerchief , like those served out to the invalids , folded like a shawl , clumsily hid her shape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her hands were rough and covered with red spots , and her forefinger was hardened and torn by the needle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had on a brown cloth cloak , a cotton gown , and heavy shoes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for her toilette ,that aerian toilette of muslin and ribbons which seemed made of gayety , folly , and music , to be full of bells , and perfumed with lilacs ,it had faded away like the dazzling hoar - frost which looks like diamonds in the sun; it melts , and leaves the branch quite black . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  what had taken place during these ten months? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine at once lost sight of favourite , zphine , and dahlia , for this tie broken on the side of the men separated the women . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine remained alone when the father of her child had gone awayalas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she found herself absolutely isolated; she had lost her habit of working , and had gained a taste for pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> led away by her liaison with tholomys to despise the little trade she knew , she had neglected her connection , and it was lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had no resource . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she knew not where to turn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had committed a fault , but the foundation of her nature , we must remember , was modesty and virtue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she felt vaguely that she was on the eve of falling into distress , and gliding into worse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine , as we shall see , possessed the stern bravery of life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had already valiantly given up dress; she dressed in calico , and had put all her silk ribbons and laces upon her daughter , the only vanity left her , and it was a holy one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she sold all she possessed , which brought her in 200 francs; and when she had paid her little debts , she had only about 80 francs left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the age of two - and - twenty , on a fine spring morning , she left paris , carrying her child on her back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we shall have no further occasion to speak of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> flix tholomys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will merely say that twenty years later , in the reign of louis philippe , he was a stout country lawyer , influential and rich , a sensible elector , and a very strict juror , but always a man of pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about mid - day , after resting herself now and then by travelling from time to time , at the rate of three or four leagues an hour , in what were then called the  - little vehicles of the suburbs of paris , -  fantine found herself at montfermeil , in the ruelle boulanger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she passed the sergeant of waterloo , the two little girls in their monster swing had dazzled her , and she stopped before this vision of joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are charms in life , and these two little girls were one for this mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she thought she saw over this inn the mysterious here of providence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she looked then , and admired them with such tenderness that at the moment when the mother was drawing breath between two verses of her song , she could not refrain from saying to her what we have already recorded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have two pretty children , madame . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the most ferocious creatures are disarmed by a caress given to their little ones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mother raised her head , thanked her , and bade her sit down on the door bench . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two women began talking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my name is madame thnardier , -  the mother of the little ones said;  - we keep this inn . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> then returning to her romance , she went on humming ,<s> <s>  - il le faut , je suis chevalier , et je pars pour la palestine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> old romances , working on the imaginations of landladies , produce that effect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was still young , scarce thirty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if this woman , now sitting , had been standing up , perhaps her height and colossal proportions , fitting for a show , would have at once startled the traveller , destroyed her confidence , and prevented what we have to record . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woman told her story with some modification . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had left paris that very morning on foot; as she felt tired from carrying her child , she had travelled by the stage - coach to villemomble , from that place she walked to montfermeil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little one had walked a little , but not much , for she was so young , and so she had been obliged to cany her , and the darling had gone to sleep ,and as she said this she gave her daughter a passionate kiss , which awoke her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we might say that they feel themselves to be angels , and know us to be men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the child began laughing , and , though its mother had to check it , slipped down to the ground with the undauntable energy of a little creature wishing to run . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all at once , she noticed the other two children in their swing , stopped short , and put out her tongue as a sign of admiration . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> children soon get familiar , and in a minute the little thnardiers were playing with the new - comer at making holes in the ground , which was an immense pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger child was very merry; the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the baby . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had picked up a piece of wood which she used as a spade , and was energetically digging a grave large enough for a fly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two went on talking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what ' s the name of your bantling?  - <s> <s>  - cosette . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we know a grandmother who contrived to make out of theodore , gnon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is her age?  - <s> <s>  - going on to three . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - just the same age as my eldest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a large worm crept out of the ground , and they were frightened , and were in ecstasy; their radiant brows touched each other; and they looked like three heads in a halo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how soon children get to know one another , -  mother thnardier exclaimed;  - why , they might be taken for three sisters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine continued ,<s> <s>  - look you , i cannot take the child with me to my town , for when a woman has a baby , it is a hard matter for her to get a situation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> people are so foolish in our part . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was heaven that made me pass in front of your inn; when i saw your little ones so pretty , so clean , so happy , it gave me a turn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  it is so; they will be three sisters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then i shall not be long before i come back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would pay six francs a month . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - six times seven are forty - two , -  said the landlady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will pay it , -  said the mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and seventeen francs in addition for extra expenses , -  the man' s voice added . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - total fifty - seven francs , -  said madame thnardier; and through these figures she sang vaguely ,<s> <s>  - il le faut , disait un guerrier . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i will pay it , -  the mother said;  - i have eighty francs , and shall have enough left to get home on foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall earn money there , and so soon as i have a little i will come and fetch my darling . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the man' s voice continued ,<s> <s>  - has the little one a stock of clothing?  - <s> <s>  - it is my husband , -  said mother thnardier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course she has clothes , poor little treasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the things are in my bag . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - they must be handed over , -  the man' s voice remarked . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the master' s face appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all right , -  he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bargain was concluded , the mother spent the night at the inn , paid her money and left her child , fastened up her bag , which was now light , and started the next morning with the intention of returning soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a neighbor' s wife saw the mother going away , and went home saying ,<s> <s>  - i have just seen a woman crying in the street as if her heart was broken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you set a famous mouse - trap with your young ones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the captured mouse was very small , but the cat is pleased even with a thin mouse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who were the thnardiers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these beings belonged to the bastard class , composed of coarse parvenus , and of degraded people of intellect , which stands between the classes called the middle and the lower , and combines some of the faults of the second with nearly all the vices of the first , though without possessing the generous impulse of the workingman or the honest regularity of the tradesman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> theirs were those dwarf natures which easily become monstrous when any gloomy fire accidentally warms them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was in the woman the basis of a witch , in the man the stuff for a beggar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are crab - like souls which constantly recoil toward darkness , retrograde in life rather than advance , employ experience to augment their deformity , incessantly grow worse , and grow more and more covered with an increasing blackness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man and this woman had souls of this sort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thnardier was peculiarly troublesome to the physiognomist: there are some men whom you need only look at to distrust them , for they are restless behind and threatening in front . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the shadow they have in their glance denounces them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this thnardier , could he be believed , had been a soldiersergeant , he said; he had probably gone through the campaign of 1815 , and had even behaved rather bravely , as it seems . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we shall see presently how the matter really stood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the epoch when the old classical romancewhich after being cllie , had now become lodoiska , and though still noble , was daily growing more vulgar , and had fallen from mademoiselle de scudri to madame bournon malarme , and from madame de lafayette to madame barthlmy hadotwas inflaming the loving soul of the porters'  wives in paris , and even extended its ravages into the suburbs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame thnardier was just intelligent enough to read books of this nature , and lived on them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she thus drowned any brains she possessed , and , so long as she remained young and a little beyond , it gave her a sort of pensive attitude by the side of her husband , who was a scamp of some depth , an almost grammatical ruffian , coarse and delicate at the same time , but who , in matters of sentimentalism , read pigault lebrun , and , in  - all that concerned the sex , -  as he said in his jargon , was a correct and unadulterated booby . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his wife was some twelve or fifteen years younger than he , and when her romantically flowing locks began to grow gray , when the megra was disengaged from the pamela , she was only a stout wicked woman , who had been pampered with foolish romances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as such absurdities cannot be read with impunity , the result was that her eldest daughter was christened ponine; as for the younger , the poor girl was all but named gulnare , and owed it to a fortunate diversion made by a romance of ducray duminil' s , that she was only christened azelma . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the way , all is not ridiculous and superficial in the curious epoch to which we are alluding , and which might be called the anarchy of baptismal names . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the side of the romantic element , which we have just pointed out , there was the social symptom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not rare at the present day for a drover' s son to be called arthur , alfred , or alphonse , and for the viscountif there are any viscounts leftto be called thomas , pierre , or jacques . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this displacement which gives the  - elegant -  name to the plebeian , and the rustic name to the aristocrat , is nothing else than an eddy of equality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beneath this apparent discord there is a grand and deep thing , the french revolution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so soon as this sum was spent , the thnardiers grew accustomed to see in the little girl a child they had taken in through charity , and treated her accordingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she had no clothes , she was dressed in the left - off chemises and petticoats of the little thnardiers , that is to say , in rags . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was fed on the leavings of everybody , a little better than the dog , and a little worse than the cat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dog and cat were her usual company at dinner: for cosette ate with them under the table off a wooden trencher like theirs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mother , who had settled , as we shall see hereafter , at m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sur m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , wrote , or , to speak more correctly , had letters written every month to inquire after her child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thnardiers invariably replied that cosette was getting on famously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the first six months had passed , the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month , and continued to send the money punctually month by month . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mother thnardier passionately loved her own two daughters , which made her detest the stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is sad to think that a mother' s love can look so ugly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this woman , like many women of her class , had a certain amount of caresses and another of blows and insults to expend daily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cosette did not make a movement that did not bring down on her head a hailstorm of violent and unmerited chastisement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as madame thnardier was unkind to cosette , ponine and azelma were the same; for children , at that age , are copies of their mother; the form is smaller , that is all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are not well off , and yet they bring up a poor child left on their hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she must not play the fool with me , -  he shouted ,  - or i' ll let her brat fall like a bomb - shell into her hiding - place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must have an increase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  the mother paid the fifteen francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> year by year the child grew , and so did her wretchedness: so long as cosette was little , she was the scape - goat of the two other children; so soon as she began to be developed a little , that is to say , even before she was five years old , she became the servant of the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at five years , the reader will say , that is improbable; but , alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> social suffering begins at any age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have we not recently seen the trial of a certain dumollard , an orphan , who turned bandit , and who from the age of five , as the official documents tell us , was alone in the world and  - worked for a living and stole - ? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cosette was made to go on messages , sweep the rooms , the yard , the street , wash the dishes , and even carry heavy bundles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thnardiers considered themselves the more justified in acting thus , because the mother , who was still at m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if the mother had returned to montfermeil at the end of three years , she would not have recognized her child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a heart - rending sight to see this poor child , scarce six years of age , shivering in winter under her calico rags , and sweeping the street before day - break , with an enormous broom in her small red hands and a tear in her large eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was this difference , however ,this poor lark never sung . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where was she; what was she doing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine had been away from her province for ten years , and while she had been slowly descending from misery to misery , her native town had prospered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about two years before , one of those industrial facts which are the events of small towns had taken place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from time immemorial m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sur m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had as a special trade the imitation of english jet and german black beads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this trade had hitherto only vegetated , owing to the dearness of the material , which reacted on the artisan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sur m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an extraordinary transformation had taken place in the production of  - black articles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  toward the close of 1815 , a man , a stranger , had settled in the town , and had the idea of substituting in this trade gum lac for rosin , and in bracelets particularly , scraps of bent plate for welded plate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this slight change was a revolution: it prodigiously reduced the cost of the material , which , in the first place , allowed the wages to be raised , a benefit for the town; secondly , improved the manufacture , an advantage for the consumer; and , thirdly , allowed the goods to be sold cheap , while tripling them the profit , an advantage for the manufacturer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on his arrival at m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sur m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had the dress , manners , and language of a workingman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sur m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with his knapsack on his back , and a knotted stick in his hand , a great fire broke out in the town hall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man rushed into the midst of the flames , and at the risk of his life saved two children who happened to belong to the captain of gendarmes; hence no one dreamed of asking for his passport . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this occasion his name was learned; he called himself father madeleine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a man of about fifty , with a preoccupied air , and he was good - hearted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that was all that could be said of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sur m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sur m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> almost rivalled london and berlin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> father madeleine' s profits were so great , that after the second year he was able to build a large factory , in which were two spacious workshops , one for men , the other for women . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> any one who was hungry need only to come , and was sure to find there employment and bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> father madeleine expected from the men good - will , from the women purity , and from all probity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this sternness was the more justifiable because m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sur m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was a garrison town , and opportunities for corruption abounded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> altogether his arrival had been a benefit , and his presence was a providence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before father madeleine came everything was languishing , and now all led the healthy life of work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a powerful circulation warmed and penetrated everything; stagnation and wretchedness were unknown . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was not a pocket , however obscure , in which there was not a little money , nor a lodging so poor in which there was not a little joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he only insisted on one thing ,be an honest man , a good girl! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in 1820 , he was known to have a sum of 630 ,000 francs in lafitte' s bank; but before he put that amount on one side he had spent more than a million for the town and the poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sur m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is divided into an upper and a lower town; the latter , in which he lived , had only one school , a poor tenement falling in ruins , and he built two , one for boys and one for girls . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he had established at his own charges an infant - school , a thing at that time almost unknown in france , and a charitable fund for old and infirm workmen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as his factory was a centre , a new district , in which there was a large number of indigent families , rapidly sprang up around it , and he opened there a free dispensary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  this seemed the more likely because he was religious , and even practised to a certain extent a course which was admired in those days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went regularly to hear low mass on sundays , and the local deputy , who scented rivalry everywhere , soon became alarmed about this religion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this deputy , who had been a member of the legislative council of the empire , shared the religious ideas of a father of the oratory , known by the name of fouch , duc d' otranto , whose creature and friend he had been . </s> </s>

<s> <s> , the services he had rendered the town were so brilliant , the will of the whole country was so unanimous , that the king again nominated him mayor of the town . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was noticed that what appeared specially to determine him was the almost angry remark of an old woman , who cried to him from her door:  - a good mayor is useful; a man should not recoil before the good he may be able to do . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the women said of him ,  - what a good bear!  -  and his great pleasure was to walk about the fields . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in proportion as leisure came with fortune , he seemed to employ it in cultivating his mind: it was noticed that with each year he spent in m his language became more polite , chosen , and gentle . </s> </s>

<s> <s> his pockets were always full of half - pence when he went out , and empty when he came home; whenever he passed through a village , the ragged children ran merrily after him , and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was supposed that he must have formerly lived a rustic life , for he had all sorts of useful secrets which he taught the peasants . </s> </s>

<s> <s> one day he saw some countrymen very busy in tearing up nettles; he looked at the pile of uprooted and already withered plants and said:  - they are dead , and yet they are good if you know how to use them . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - he is in mourning for the bishop , -  was said in drawing - rooms; this added inches to m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the microscopic faubourg st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> germain of the town thought about putting an end to the coventry of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine , the probable relation of a bishop , and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine remarked the promotion he had obtained in the increased love of the old ladies , and the greater amount of smiles from the young . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one evening a lady belonging to this little great world , curious by right of seniority , ventured to say ,  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> le maire is doubtless a cousin of the late bishop of d?  - <s> <s> he answered ,  - no , madame . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - in my youth i was a footman in his family , -  was the answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another thing noticed was , that when a young savoyard passed through the town , looking for chimneys to sweep , the mayor sent for him , asked his name , and gave him money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by degrees and with time all the opposition died out; at first there had been calumnies against m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the respect felt for him was complete , unanimous , and cordial , and the moment arrived in 1821 when the name of the mayor was uttered at m with nearly the same accent as  - monseigneur the bishop -  had been said at d in 1815 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> people came for ten leagues round to consult m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everybody was willing to accept him as arbiter , and it seemed as if he had the book of natural law for his soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a sort of contagious veneration , which in six or seven years spread all over the country - side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only one man in the town and bailiwick resisted this contagion , and whatever m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine might do , remained rebellious to it , as if a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct kept him on his guard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would appear , in fact , as if there is in certain men a veritable bestial instinct , though pure and honest as all instincts are , which creates sympathies and antipathies; which fatally separates one nature from another; which never hesitates; which is not troubled , is never silent , and never contradicts itself; which is clear in its obscurity , infallible , imperious; refractory to all the counsels of intelligence and all the solvents of the reason , and which , whatever the way in which destinies are made , surely warns the man - dog of the man - cat , and the man - fox of the presence of the man - lion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it often happened when m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine passed along a street , calmly , kindly , and greeted by the blessings of all , that a tall man , dressed in an iron - gray great - coat , armed with a thick cane , and wearing a hat with turned - down brim , turned suddenly and looked after him till he disappeared; folding his arms , shaking his head , and raising his upper lip with the lower as high as his nose , a sort of significant grimace , which may be translated , - who is that man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am certain that i have seen him somewhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at any rate , i am not his dupe . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> this person , who was grave , with an almost menacing gravity , was one of those men who , though only noticed for a moment , preoccupy the observer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his name was javert , and he belonged to the police , and performed at m the laborious but useful duties of an inspector . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when javert arrived at m , the great manufacturer' s fortune was made , and father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some police officers have a peculiar face , which is complicated by an air of baseness , blended with an air of authority . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in our conviction , if souls were visible , we should distinctly see the strange fact that every individual of the human species corresponds to some one of the species of animal creation; and we might occurred to the thinker , that , from the oyster to the eagle , from the hog to the tiger , all animals are in man , and that each of them is in a man; at times several of them at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god shows these to us in order to make us reflect; but , as animals are only shadows , god has not made them capable of education in the complete sense of the term , for of what use would it be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the other hand , our souls being realities and having an end of their own , god has endowed them with intelligence; that is to say , possible education . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , if the reader will admit with me for a moment that in every man there is one of the animal species of creation , it will be easy for us to say what javert the policeman was . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when he grew up he thought that he was beyond the pale of society , and despaired of ever entering it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he noticed that society inexorably keeps at bay two classes of men ,those who attack it , and those who guard it; he had only a choice between these two classes , and at the same time felt within him a rigidness , regularity , and probity , combined with an inexpressible hatred of the race of bohemians to which he belonged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he entered the police , got on , and at the age of forty was an inspector . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his youth he was engaged in the southern bagnes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before going further , let us explain the words  - human face -  which we applied just now to javert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his human face consisted of a stub - nose , with two enormous nostrils , toward which enormous whiskers mounted on his cheeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when javert laughed , which was rare and terrible , his thin lips parted , and displayed , not only his teeth , but his gums , and a savage flat curl formed round his nose , such as is seen on the muzzle of a wild beast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert when serious was a bull - dog; when he laughed he was a tiger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man was made up of two very simple and relatively excellent feelings , but which he almost rendered bad by exaggerating them ,respect for authority and hatred of rebellion; and in his eyes , robbery , murder , and every crime were only forms of rebellion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he covered with contempt , aversion , and disgust , every one who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he fully shared the opinion of those extreme minds that attribute to the human law some power of making or verifying demons , and that place a styx at the bottom of society . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was stoical , stern , and austere; a sad dreamer , and humble yet haughty , like all fanatics . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his glance was a gimlet , for it was cold and piercing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his whole life was composed in the two words , watching and overlooking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had introduced the straight line into what is the most tortuous thing in the world; he was conscious of his usefulness , had religious respect for his duties , and was a spy as well as another is a priest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> woe to the wretch who came into his clutches! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he would have done it with that sort of inner satisfaction which virtue produces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with all this he spent a life of privation , isolation , self - denial , chastity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was the implacable duty , the police comprehended as the spartans comprehended sparta , a pitiless watchman , a savage integrity , a marble - hearted spy , a brutus contained in a vidocq . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert' s entire person expressed the man who spies and hides himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his forehead could not be seen , for it was hidden by his hat; his eyes could not be seen , because they were lost under his eye - brows; his chin was plunged into his cravat , his hands were covered by his cuffs , and his cane was carried under his coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when the opportunity arrived , there could be seen suddenly emerging from all this shadow , as from an ambush , an angular , narrow forehead , a fatal glance , a menacing chin , enormous hands , and a monstrous rattan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his leisure moments , which were few , he read , though he hated books , and this caused him not to be utterly ignorant , as could be noticed through a certain emphasis in his language . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the name of javert , if uttered , set them to flight; the face of javert , if seen , petrified them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine , an eye fall of suspicion and conjectures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine noticed it in the end; but he considered it a matter of insignificance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he treated javert like every one else , easily and kindly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once he happened to say , talking to himself ,  - i believe that i have got him; -  then he remained thoughtful for three days without saying a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seems that the thread which he fancied he held was broken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , there cannot be any theory really infallible in a human creature , and it is the peculiarity of instinct that it can be troubled , thrown out , and routed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine' s complete naturalness and calmness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day , however , his strange manner seemed to produce an impression on m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the occasion was as follows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine was passing one morning through an unpaved lane in the town , he heard a noise and saw a group at some distance , to which he walked up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this fauchelevent was one of the few enemies m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine still had at this time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when madeleine came to these parts , fauchelevent , a tolerably well - educated peasant , was doing badly in business; and he saw the simple workman grow rich , while he , a master , was being ruined . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then bankruptcy came , and in his old days , having only a horse and cart left , and no family , he turned carter to earn a living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the horse had both legs broken and could not get up , while the old man was entangled between the wheels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fall had been so unfortunate , that the whole weight of the cart was pressing on his chest , and it was heavily loaded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fauchelevent uttered lamentable groans , and attempts had been made , though in vain , to draw him out; any irregular effort , any clumsy help or shock , might kill him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was impossible to extricate him except by raising the cart from below , and javert , who came up at the moment of the accident , had sent to fetch a jack . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine approached , the mob made way respectfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine turned to the spectators . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you a jack?  - <s> <s>  - they have gone to fetch one , -  a peasant answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how soon will it be here?  - <s> <s>  - well , the nearest is at flachot the blacksmith' s , but it cannot be brought here under a good quarter of an hour . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - a quarter of an hour!  -  madeleine exclaimed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was evident that his ribs would be broken within five minutes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine to the peasants who were looking on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we must . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - but do you not see that the cart is sinking into the ground?  - <s> <s>  - hang it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so it is . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - listen to me , -  madeleine continued;  - there is still room enough for a man to slip under the cart and raise it with his back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it will only take half a minute , and the poor man can be drawn out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is there any one here who has strong loins? </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> no one stirred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his hearers looked down , and one of them muttered ,  - a man would have to be deucedly strong , and , besides , he would run a risk of being smashed . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - come , -  madeleine began again ,  - twenty louis . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  the same silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not the good - will they are deficient in , -  a voice cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine turned and recognized javert: he had noticed him when he came up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert continued ,<s> <s>  - it is the strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man would have to be tremendously strong to lift a cart like that with his back . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> then , looking fixedly at m . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - indeed!  -  said madeleine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at the toulon bagne . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> madeleine turned pale; all this while the cart was slowly settling down , and father fauchelevent was screaming ,<s> <s>  - i am choking: it is breaking my ribs: a jack! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> somethingoh!  - <s> <s> madeleine looked around him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is there no one here willing to earn twenty louis and save this poor old man' s life?  - <s> <s> no one stirred , and javert repeated ,<s> <s>  - i never knew but one man capable of acting as a jack , and it was that convict . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - oh , it is crushing me!  -  the old man yelled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine raised his head , met javert' s falcon eye still fixed on him , gazed at the peasants , and sighed sorrowfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a frightful moment of expectation and silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine almost lying flat under the tremendous weight , twice tried in vain to bring his elbows up to his knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must die , so leave me; you will be killed too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cart was lifted by twenty arms , and old fauchelevent was saved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine rose; he was livid , although dripping with perspiration: his clothes were torn and covered with mud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man kissed his knees , and called him his savior , while madeleine had on his face a strange expression of happy and celestial suffering , and turned his placid eye on javert , who was still looking at him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> father fauchelevent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning the old man found a thousand - franc note by his bed - side , with a line in m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> madeleine was appointed mayor; the first time javert saw him wearing the scarf which gave him all authority in the town , he felt that sort of excitement a dog would feel that scented a wolf in its master' s clothes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from this moment he avoided him as much as he could , and when duty imperiously compelled him , and he could not do otherwise than appear before the mayor , he addressed him with profound respect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when work abounds , when the country is happy and rich , the taxes are paid cheerfully , and cost the state little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we may say that wretchedness and the public exchequer have an infallible thermometer in the cost of collecting the taxes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in seven years these costs had been reduced three - fourths in the arrondissement of m , which caused it to be frequently quoted by m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> no one remembered her , but luckily the door of m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as the trade was quite new to fantine , she was awkward at it and earned but small wages; but that was enough , for she had solved the problem ,she was earning her livelihood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when fantine saw that she could earn her own living , she had a moment of joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a taste for work really came back to her: she bought a looking - glass , delighted in seeing in it her youth , her fine hair and fine teeth; forgot many things , only thought of cosette , and her possible future , and was almost happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she hired a small room and furnished it , on credit , to be paid for out of her future earnings ,this was a relic of her irregular habits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the outset , as we have seen , she punctually paid the thnardiers; and as she could only sign her name , she was compelled to write to them through the agency of a public writer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was noticed that she wrote frequently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was beginning to be whispered in the shop that fantine  - wrote letters , -  and was  - carrying on . </s> </s>

<s> <s> astounding to say , this old woman had once been young; in her youth , in ' 93 , she had married a monk , who escaped from the cloisters in a red cap , and passed over from the bernardines to the jacobins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was dry , crabbed , sharp , thorny , and almost venomous , while remembering the monk whose widow she was and who had considerably tamed her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had a small estate which she left with considerable pallor to a religious community , and she was very welcome at the episcopal palace of arras . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this madame victurnien , then , went to montfermeil , and when she returned , said ,  - i have seen the child . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> all this took time , and fantine had been more than a year at the factory , when one morning the forewoman handed her 50 francs in the mayor' s name , and told her that she was no longer engaged , and had better leave the town , so the mayor said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> crushed by shame more than disgrace , she left the factory , and returned to her room: her fault then was now known to all! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she did not feel the strength in her to say a word; she was advised to see the mayor , but did not dare do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mayor gave her 50 francs because he was kind , and discharged her because he was just; and she bowed her head to the sentence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the monk' s widow , then , was good for something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine , however , knew nothing of all this; and they were combinations of events of which the world is fall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine trusted to her in everything , for the best men are often forced to delegate their authority , and it was with this fall power , and in the conviction she was acting rightly , that the forewoman tried , condemned , and executed fantine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine had given her for alms and helping the workwomen , and which she did not account for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine tried to get a servant' s place in the town , and went from house to house , but no one would have anything to do with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  the landlord to whom she owed her rent , said to her ,  - you are young and pretty , you can pay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  she divided the 50 francs between the landlord and the broker , gave back to the latter three - fourths of the goods , only retaining what was absolutely necessary , and found herself without work , without a trade , with only a bed , and still owing about 100 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she set to work making coarse shirts for the troops , and earned at this sixpence a day , her daughter costing her fourpence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was at this moment she began to fall in arrears with the thnardiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind living on little , there is living on nothing: there are two chambers ,the first is obscure , the second quite dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we do not know all that certain weak beings , who have grown old in want and honesty , can get out of a halfpenny , and in the end it becomes a talent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine acquired this sublime talent , and regained a little courage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , when you are sad , you eat less . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suffering , anxiety , a little bread on one side and sorrow on the other , all will support me . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> in this distress , it would have been a strange happiness to have had her daughter with her , and she thought of sending for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called indigent life , was a pious creature , poor , and charitable to the poor and even to the rich , who could just write her name ,  - marguerite , -  and believed in god , which is knowledge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are many such virtues down here , and one day they will be up above , for this life has a morrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every one stared at her , and no one bowed to her; the cold bitter contempt of the passers - by passed through her flesh and her mind like an east wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in small towns an unhappy girl seems to be naked beneath the sarcasm and curiosity of all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in paris , at least no one knows you , and that obscurity is a garment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she must grow accustomed to disrespect , as she had done to poverty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she came and went , with head erect and with a bitter smile , and felt that she was growing impudent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame victurnien sometimes saw her pass from her window; she noticed the distress of  - the creature whom she had made know her place , -  and congratulated herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wicked have a black happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she sometimes said to her neighbor ,  - marguerite , just feel how hot my hands are!  -  still , in the morning , when she passed an old broken comb through her glorious hair , which shone like floss silk , she had a minute of happy coquettishness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> short days and less work; in winter there is no warmth , no light , no mid - day , for the evening is joined to the morning; there is fog , twilight , the window is gray , and you cannot see clearly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sky is like a dark vault , and the sun has the look of a poor man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a frightful season; winter changes into stone the water of heaven and the heart of man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her creditors pressed her , for fantine was earning too little , and her debts had increased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thnardiers , being irregularly paid , constantly wrote her letters , whose contents afflicted her , and postage ruined her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day they wrote her that little cosette was quite naked , that she wanted a flannel skirt , and that the mother must send at least ten francs for the purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she crumpled the letter in her hands all day , and at nightfall went to a barber' s at the corner of the street , and removed her comb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her splendid light hair fell down to her hips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what will you give me for it?  -  she asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ten francs . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - cut it off . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> she bought a skirt and sent to the thnardiers; it made them furious , for they wanted the money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine thought ,  - my child is no longer cold , for i have dressed her in my hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  she wore small round caps which hid her shorn head , and she still looked pretty in them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she passed the factory she pretended to laugh and sing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an old workwoman who once saw her doing so , said ,  - that' s a girl who will come to a bad end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  she took a lover , the first who offered , a man she did not love , through bravado and with rage in her heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a scoundrel , a sort of mendicant musician , an idle scamp , who beat her , and left her , as she had chosen him , in disgust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she adored her child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lower she sank , the darker the gloom became around her , the more did this sweet little angel gleam in her soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she said:  - when i am rich , i shall have my cosette with me; -  and she laughed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she did not get rid of her cough , and she felt a cold perspiration in her back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day she received from the thnardiers a letter to the following effect:  - cosette is ill with a complaint which is very prevalent in the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is called miliary fever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you do not send us forty francs within a week , the little one will be dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  she burst into a loud laugh , and said to her old neighbor ,  - oh , what funny people! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they want forty francs; where do they expect me to get them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some one who met her said ,  - what has made you so merry?  -  and she answered ,  - it is a piece of stupidity some country folk have written; they want forty francs of methe asses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a dentist going his rounds , who offered the public complete sets of teeth , opiates , powders , and elixirs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine joined the crowd and began laughing like the rest at this harangue , in which there was slang for the mob , and scientific jargon for respectable persons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the extractor of teeth saw the pretty girl laughing , and suddenly exclaimed ,<s> <s>  - you have fine teeth , my laughing beauty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you like to sell me your two top front teeth , i will give you a napoleon apiece for them . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - what a horrible idea!  -  fantine exclaimed . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> fantine ran away and stopped her ears not to hear the hoarse voice of the man , who shouted ,<s> <s>  - think it over , my dear: two napoleons may be useful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if your heart says yes , come to - night to the tillac d' argent , where you will find me . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> fantine , when she reached home , was furious , and told her good neighbor marguerite what had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is he not an abominable man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can people like that be allowed to go about the country? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , i should look horrible; hair grows again , but teeth! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , the monster! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would sooner throw myself head first out of a fifth - floor window on to the pavement . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - and what did he offer you?  -  marguerite asked . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - that makes forty francs . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - yes , -  said fantine ,  - that makes forty francs . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> she became thoughtful and sat down to her work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of a quarter of an hour , she left the room and read thnardier' s letter again on the staircase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she returned , she said to marguerite ,<s> <s>  - do you know what a miliary fever is?  - <s> <s>  - yes , -  said the old woman ,  - it is an illness . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - does it require much medicine?  - <s> <s>  - oh , an awful lot!  - <s> <s>  - does it attack children?  - <s> <s>  - more than anybody . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - do they die of it?  - <s> <s>  - plenty , -  said marguerite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine went out and read the letter once again on the staircase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at night she went out , and could be seen proceeding in the direction of the rue de paris , where the inns are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning , when marguerite entered fantine' s room before day - break , for they worked together , and they made one candle do for them both , she found her sitting on her bed , pale and chill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her cap had fallen on her knees , and the candle had been burning all night , and was nearly consumed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the candle nearly burnt out! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> something must have happened . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> then she looked at fantine , who turned her close - shaven head towards her , and seemed to have grown ten years older since the previous day . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> as she said this , she pointed to two napoleons that glistened on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , lord!  -  said marguerite;  - why ,' t is a fortune; where ever did you get them from?  - <s> <s>  - i had them by me , -  fantine answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she sent the forty francs to montfermeil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it had only been a trick of the thnardiers to get money , for cosette was not ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine threw her looking - glass out of the window; she had long before left her cell on the second floor for a garret under the roof ,one of those tenements in which the ceiling forms an angle with the floor , and you knock your head at every step . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor man can only go to the end of his room , as to the end of his destiny , by stooping more and more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had no bed left; she had only a rag she called a blanket , a mattress on the ground , and a bottomless chair; a little rose - tree she had had withered away , forgotten in a corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in another corner she had a pail to hold water , which froze in winter , and in which the different levels of the water remained marked for a long time by rings of ice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had lost her shame , and now lost her coquetry; the last sign was , that she went out with dirty caps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> either through want of time or carelessness , she no longer mended her linen , and as the heels of her stockings wore out , she tucked them into her shoes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the people to whom she owed money made  - scenes , -  and allowed her no rest; she met them in the street , she met them again on the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her eyes were very bright , and she felt a settled pain at the top of her left shoulder - blade , while she coughed frequently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she deeply hated father madeleine , and sewed for seventeen hours a day; but a speculator hired all the female prisoners , and reduced the prices of the free workmen to nine sous a day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seventeen hours'  work for nine sous! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her creditors were more pitiless than ever , and the broker , who had got back nearly all her furniture , incessantly said to her ,  - when are you going to pay me , you cheat?  -  what did they want of her , good heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about the same time thnardier wrote to her , that he had decidedly waited too patiently , and that unless he received one hundred francs at once , he would turn poor cosette , who had scarce recovered , out of doors into the cold , and she must do what she could or die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one hundred francs!  -  fantine thought;  - but where is the trade in which i can earn one hundred sous a day? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will sell all that is left!  - <s> <s> and the unfortunate girl went on the streets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is this story of fantine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is society buying a slave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of misery , of hunger , of cold , of loneliness , of desertion , of destitution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a soul for a morsel of bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> misery offers its wares , and society accepts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that' s a mistake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it still exists; but it weighs now only on woman , and its name is prostitution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is not one of the least reproaches upon man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the point which we have reached in this painful drama , there is nothing left in fantine of her former self . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whoever touches her is chilled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> life and social order have said to her their last word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she shuns nothing now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she fears nothing now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let the whole sky fall on her , let the whole ocean pass over her! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what does she care? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at least she thinks so; but it is never safe to think that you have drained the cup of misfortune , or that you have reached the end of anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are all these destinies driven along thus helter - skelter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where are they going? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why are they what they are? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he who knows this sees the whole shadow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is in all small towns , and there was at m in particular , a class of young men , who squander fifteen hundred francs a year in the provinces with the same air as those of the same set in paris devour two hundred thousand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are beings of the great neutral species; geldings , parasites , nobodies , who possess a little land , a little folly , and a little wit , who would be rustics in a drawing - room , and believe themselves gentlemen in a pot - house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they talk about my fields , my woods , my peasants , horses , the actresses , to prove themselves men of taste; quarrel with the officers , to prove themselves men of war; shoot , smoke , yawn , drink , smell of tobacco , play at billiards , watch the travellers get out of the stage - coach , live at the caf , dine at the inn , have a dog that gnaws bones under the table , and a mistress who places the dishes upon it; haggle over a son , exaggerate the fashions , admire tragedy , despise women , wear out their old boots , copy london through paris , and paris through pont -  - mousson; grow stupidly old , do not work , are of no use , and do no great harm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> flix tholomys remained in his province and not seen paris , he would have been one of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if they were richer , people would say they are dandies; if poorer , they are loafers; but they are simply men without occupation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> among them there are bores and bored , dreamers , and a few scamps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the provincial dandy wore longer spurs and more ferocious moustachios . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the period of the struggle of the south american republics against the king of spain , of bolivar against morillo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> narrow - brimmed hats were royalist , and called morillos , while the liberals wore broad brims , which were called bolivars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eight or ten months after the events we have described in the previous chapter , toward the beginning of january , and on a night when snow had fallen , one of these dandiesa man of  - right sentiments , -  for he wore a morillo , and was also warmly wrapped up in one of the large spanish cloaks which at that time completed the fashionable costume in cold weatherwas amusing himself by annoying a creature who was prowling about in a low - neck balldress , and with flowers in her hair , before the window of the officers'  caf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this dandy was smoking , as that was a decided mark of fashion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each time this woman passed him , he made some remark to her , which he fancied witty and amusing , as:  - how ugly you are! why don' t you go to kennel? you have no teeth , -  etc . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , etc . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this gentleman' s name was monsieur bamatabois . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woman , a sad - dressed phantom walking backwards and forwards in the snow , made him no answer , did not even look at him , but still continued silently and with a gloomy regularity her walk , which , every few minutes , brought her under his sarcasms , like the condemned soldier running the gauntlet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the slight effect produced doubtless annoyed the idler , for taking advantage of her back being turned , he crept up behind her , stooped to pick up a handful of snow , and suddenly plunged it between her bare shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these insults , vomited by a voice rendered hoarse by brandy , hideously issued from a mouth in which the two front teeth were really missing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was fantine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the noise , the officers left the caf in a throng , the passers - by stopped , and a laughing , yelling , applauding circle was made round these two beings , in whom it was difficult to recognize a man and a woman ,the man struggling , his hat on the ground , the woman striking with feet and fists , bareheaded , yelling , without teeth or hair , livid with passion , and horrible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all at once a tall man quickly broke through the crowd , seized the woman' s satin dress , which was covered with mud , and said:  - follow me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  the woman raised her hand , and her passionate voice suddenly died out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her eyes were glassy , she grew pale instead of being livid , and trembled with fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had recognized javert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dandy profited by this incident to make his escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert broke through the circle and began walking with long strides toward the police office , which is at the other end of the market - place , dragging the wretched girl after him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she allowed him to do so mechanically , and neither he nor she said a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the crowd of spectators , in a paroxysm of delight , followed them with coarse jokes , for supreme misery is an occasion for obscenities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on reaching the police office , which was a low room , heated by a stove , and guarded by a sentry , and having a barred glass door opening on the street , javert walked in with fantine , and shut the door after him , to the great disappointment of the curious , who stood on tip - toe , and stretched out their necks in front of the dirty window trying to see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on entering , fantine crouched down motionless in a corner like a frightened dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sergeant on duty brought in a candle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert sat down at a table , took a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket , and began writing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> women of this class are by the french laws left entirely at the discretion of the police: they do what they like with them , punish them as they think proper , and confiscate the two sad things which they call their trade and their liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this instant he felt that his high stool was a tribunal , and himself the judge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he tried and he condemned: he summoned all the ideas he had in his mind round the great thing he was doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the more he examined the girl' s deed , the more outraged he felt: for it was evident that he had just seen a crime committed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had seen in the street , society , represented by a householder and elector , insulted and attacked by a creature beyond the pale of everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a prostitute had assaulted a citizen , and he , javert , had witnessed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wrote on silently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had finished , he affixed his signature , folded up the paper , and said to the sergeant as he handed it to him:  - take these men and lead this girl to prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  then he turned to fantine ,  - you will have six months for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , what will become of cosette , my child , my child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , i owe more than one hundred francs to thnardier , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur javert , -  she said ,  - i ask for mercy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i assure you that i was not in the wrong; if you had seen the beginning , you would say so; i swear by our saviour that i was not to blame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that gentleman , who was a stranger to me , put snow down my back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it sent me wild , for you must know i am not very well , and besides he had been abusing me - you are ugly , you have no teeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did nothing , and said to myself ,  - this gentleman is amusing himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  i was civil to him , and said nothing , and it was at this moment he put the snow down my back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert , is there no one who saw it to tell you that this is the truth? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , something so cold put down your back , at a moment when you are least expecting it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was; wrong to destroy the gentleman' s hat , but why has he gone away? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would ask his pardon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would willingly do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me off this time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert , perhaps you do not know that in prison you can only earn seven sous a day; it is not the fault of government , but you only earn seven sous; and just fancy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have one hundred francs to pay , or my child will be turned into the street . </s> </s>

<s> <s> oh , my cosette , oh , my little angel , what ever will become of you , poor darling! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must tell you that the thnardiers are inn - keepers , peasants , and unreasonable; they insist on having their money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , do not send me to prison! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look you , the little thing will be turned into the streets in the middle of winter to go where she likes , and you must take pity on that , my kind m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if she were older she could earn her living , but at her age it is impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in happier times you need only have looked into my chest of drawers , and you would have seen that i was not a disorderly woman , for i had linen , plenty of linen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert!  - <s> <s> she spoke thus , crushed , shaken by sobs , blinded by tears , wringing her hands , interrupted by a sharp dry cough , and stammering softly , with death imprinted on her voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from time to time she stopped , and tenderly kissed the skirt of the policeman' s coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she would have melted a heart of granite ,but a wooden heart cannot be moved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be off now; you have six months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eternal father in person could not alter it . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> on hearing this solemn phrase , she understood that sentence was passed; she fell all of a heap , murmuring ,  - mercy!  -  but javert turned his back , and the soldiers seized her arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some minutes previously a man had entered unnoticed; he had closed the door , leaned against it , and heard fantine' s desperate entreaties . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the moment when the soldiers laid hold of the unhappy girl , who would not rise , he emerged from the gloom , and said ,<s> <s>  - wait a minute , if you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine; he took off his hat , and bowed with a sort of vexed awkwardness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> le maire - <s> <s> the words  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> le maire -  produced a strange effect on fantine; she sprang up like a spectre emerging from the ground , thrust back the soldiers , walked straight up to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine before she could be prevented , and , looking at him wildly , she exclaimed ,<s> <s>  - so you are the mayor?  - <s> <s> then she burst into a laugh , and spat in his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine wiped his face , and said ,<s> <s>  - inspector javert , set this woman at liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to see a girl of the town spit in the mayor' s face was so monstrous a thing that he would have regarded it as sacrilege even to believe it possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when he saw this mayor , this magistrate , calmly wipe his face , and say ,  - set this woman at liberty , -  he had a bedazzlement of stupor , so to speak; thought and language failed him equally , for he had passed the limits of possible amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his sentence had produced an equally strange effect on fantine; she raised her bare arm , and clung to the chimney - key of the stove like a tottering person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she looked around , and began saying in a low voice , as if speaking to herself ,<s> <s>  - at liberty! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall not be sent to prison for six months! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who said that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is impossible that any one said it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must have heard badly; it cannot be that monster of a mayor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it you , my kind m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that monster of a mayor , that old villain of a mayor , is the cause of it all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert , he discharged me on account of a parcel of sluts gossiping in the shop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was not that horrible ,to discharge a poor girl who is doing her work fairly! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after that i did not earn enough , and all this misfortune came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first place , there is an improvement which the police gentry ought to make , and that is to prevent persons in prison injuring poor people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will explain this to you; you earn twelve sous for making a shirt , but it falls to seven , and then you can no longer live , and are obliged to do what you can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as i had my little cosette i was forced to become a bad woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can now understand how it was that beggar of a mayor who did all the mischief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert , i never did any harm purposely , and i see everywhere much worse women than myself who are much more fortunate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , monsieur javert , you said that i was to be set at liberty , did you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make inquiries , speak to my landlord; i pay my rent now , and you will hear that i am honest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , good gracious! </s> </s>

<s> <s> -  as a rumor had spread about the affair in the police office , the lady - manager of the post , and some other persons who saw the letter before it was sent off and recognized javert' s handwriting , supposed that he was sending in his resignation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine hastened to write to the thnardiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this dazzled thnardier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this bill two undeniable amounts figure , one from a physician , the other from an apothecary , who had attended ponine and azelma in a long illness . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s>  - christi!  -  said thnardier ,  - we must not let the child go . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> in the mean while fantine did not recover , and still remained in the infirmary . </s> </s>

<s> <s> one day the sisters heard her say in the paroxysm of fever ,  - i have been a sinner , but when i have my child by my side , that will show that god has forgiven me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet it was for her sake that i did wrong , and for that reason god pardons me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she knows nothing , as she is an angel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my sisters , at her age the wings have not yet dropped off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine went to see her twice a day , and every time she asked him ,  - shall i see my cosette soon?  - <s> <s> he would answer ,<s> <s>  - to - morrow , perhaps; she may arrive at any moment , for i am expecting her . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> and the mother' s pale face would grow radiant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh!  -  she said ,  - how happy i shall be!  - <s> <s> we have said that she did not improve; on the contrary , her condition seemed to grow worse week by week . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the handful of snow placed between her naked shoulder - blades produced a sudden check of perspiration , which caused the illness that had smouldered in her for years suddenly to break out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> larmier' s fine method for studying and healing diseases of the lungs was just beginning to be employed; the physician placed the stethoscope to fantine' s chest , and shook his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine said to him ,<s> <s>  - well?  - <s> <s>  - has she not a child that she wishes to see?  -  asked the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine forced a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he said that your child must come at once , for that would cure you . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - oh , -  she replied ,  - he is right; but what do those thnardiers mean by keeping my cosette? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , she will come , and then i shall see happiness close to me . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> thnardier , however , would not let the child go , and alleged a hundred poor excuses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cosette was ailing , and it would be dangerous for her to travel in winter; and then there were some small debts still to pay , which he was collecting , &c . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will send some one to fetch cosette , -  said father madeleine;  - if necessary , i will go myself . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he did not put himself out of the way for javert , for he could not refrain from thinking of poor fantine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert bowed respectfully to the mayor , who had his back turned to him; the mayor did not look at him , but continued to make his notes . </s> </s>

<s> <s> javert had nothing in his mind which he did not also have in his face , and , like all violent men , he was subject to sudden changes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never had his face been stranger or more surprising . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was waiting , without saying a word , without making a movement , in a true humility and tranquil resignation , till the mayor might think proper to turn round ,calm , serious , hat in hand , and with an expression which was half - way between the private before his officer and the culprit before the judge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the feelings as well as all the resolutions he might be supposed to possess had disappeared: there was nothing but a gloomy sadness on this face , which was impenetrable and simple as granite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length the mayor laid down his pen and half turned round . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - what deed?  - <s> <s>  - an inferior agent of authority has failed in his respect to a magistrate in the gravest matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have come , as is my duty , to bring the fact to your knowledge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine asked<s> <s>  - myself . </s> </s>

<s> <s> such a course is honorable , but i have done wrong , and deserve punishment . </s> </s>

<s> <s> madeleine exclaimed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what have you done to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you accuse yourself , you wish to be removed - <s> <s>  - dismissed , -  said javert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not understand it . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> javert heaved a deep sigh , and continued still coldly and sadly ,<s> <s>  - six weeks ago , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> le maire , after the scene about that girl , i was furious , and denounced you . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - denounced me?  - <s> <s>  - to the prefect of police at paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine , who did not laugh much oftener than javert , burst into a laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as a mayor who had encroached on the police?  - <s> <s>  - as an ex - galley slave . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the mayor turned livid , but javert , who had not raised his eyes , continued ,<s> <s>  - i thought you were so , and have had these notions for a long time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a resemblance , information you sought at faverolles , the strength of your loins , the adventures with old fauchelevent , your skill in firing , your leg which halts a littleand so on . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - what name did you say?  - <s> <s>  - jean valjean; he is a convict i saw twenty years ago when i was assistant keeper at the toulon bagne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> passion decided me , and i denounced you to the prefect . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine , who had taken up the charge - book again , said with a careless accent ,<s> <s>  - and what was the answer you received?  - <s> <s>  - that i was mad!  - <s> <s>  - well?  - <s> <s>  - they were right . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - it is fortunate that you allow it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine was holding fell from his grasp , he raised his head , looked searchingly at javert , said with an indescribable accent ,<s> <s>  - ah!  - <s> <s> javert continued ,<s> <s>  - the facts are these , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> le maire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seems that there was over at ailly le haut clocher , an old fellow who was called father champmathieu . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this champmathieu was arrested with the branch still in his hand , and was locked up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the lock - up was under repair , the magistrates ordered that champmathieu should be taken to the departmental prison at arras . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this prison there is an ex - convict of the name of brevet , under imprisonment for some offence , and he has been made room - turnkey for his good behavior . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> champmathieu no sooner arrived than brevet cries out ,  - why , i know this man: he is an ex - convict . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look at me , old fellow: you are jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you were at the toulon bagne twenty years ago , and i was there too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this champmathieu about thirty years ago was a journeyman wood - cutter at several places , especially at faverolles , where his trail is lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a long time after he is found again in auvergne , and then in paris , where he says he was a blacksmith , and had a daughter a washer - woman ,though there is no evidence of this ,and lastly , he turned up in these parts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , before being sent to the galleys , what was jean valjean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at faverolles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is more natural to suppose than that on leaving the bagne he assumed his mother' s name as a disguise , and called himself jean mathieu? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went to auvergne , where jean is pronounced chan , and thus he was transformed into champmathieu . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are following me , i suppose? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquiries have been made at faverolles , but jean valjean' s family is no longer there , and no one knows where it has gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as you are aware , in those places families frequently disappear in such a way; these people , if they are not mud , are dust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , again , as the beginning of this story dates back thirty years , there is no one in faverolles who knew jean valjean: and beside brevet , there are only two convicts who remember him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these two were brought from the bagne and confronted with the pretended champmathieu , and they did not hesitate for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can conceive that this surprised me , as i fancied that i held my jean valjean here . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - well?  -  m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine interrupted him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert answered with his incorruptible and sad face ,<s> <s>  - monsieur le maire , truth is truth: i am sorry , but that man is jean valjean: i recognized him too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine said in a very low voice ,<s> <s>  - are you sure?  - <s> <s> javert burst into that sorrowful laugh which escapes from a profound conviction ,<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> certain . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he stood for a moment pensive , mechanically taking pinches of saw - dust out of the sprinkler in the inkstand , and added ,<s> <s>  - and now that i have seen the real jean valjean , i cannot understand how i could have believed anything else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is no longer a matter for the police courts , but for the assizes; it is no longer imprisonment for a few days , but the galleys for life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and there is the matter with the savoyard , which , i trust , will be brought up again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is enough to settle a man , is there not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but jean valjean is artful , and in that i recognize him too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> any other man would find it warm; he would struggle , cry out , refuse to be jean valjean , and so on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he pretends though not to understand , and says ,  - i am champmathieu , and i shall stick to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert , you will go at one to mother busaupied , who sells vegetables at the corner of the rue st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> saulve , and tell her to take out a summons against pierre the carter; he is a brutal fellow , who almost drove over this woman and her child , and he must be punished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will then go to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i am giving you a deal to do , and i think you said you were going away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you not state you were going to arras on this matter in a week or ten days?  - <s> <s>  - sooner than that , sir . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - on what day , then?  - <s> <s>  - i fancied i told you that the trial comes off to - morrow , and that i should start by to - night' s coach . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - and how long will the trial last?  - <s> <s>  - a day at the most , and sentence will be passed to - morrow night at the latest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i shall not wait for that , but return so soon as i have given my evidence . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - very good , -  said m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he did not go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i beg your pardon , m . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s>  - i repeat , -  m . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> but javert , only attending to his own thoughts , continued ,<s> <s>  - as for exaggerating , i am not doing so , for this is how i reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i suspected you unjustly; that is nothing: it is the duty of men like myself to suspect , though there is an abuse in suspecting those above us . </s> </s>

<s> <s> stay , monsieur le maire , one word more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have often been severe in my life to others , for it was just , and i was doing my duty , and if i were not severe to myself now , all the justice i have done would become injustice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ought i to spare myself more than others? </s> </s>

<s> <s> come! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> le maire , i am bound to treat myself as i would treat another man; when i repressed malefactors , when i was severe with scamps , i often said to myself ,  - if you ever catch yourself tripping , look out , -  i have tripped , i have committed a fault , and all the worse for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have strong arms and will turn laborer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> madeleine went to see fantine as usual; but before going to her , he asked for sister simplice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two nuns who managed the infirmary , who were lazarets , like all sisters of charity , were known by the names of sisters perpetua and simplice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this type is not rare , for the monastic orders gladly accept this clumsy peasant clay , which can be easily fashioned into a capuchin friar or an ursuline nun; and these rusticities are employed in the heavy work of devotion . </s> </s>

<s> <s> sister perpetua was a strong nun belonging to marnies near pantoise , who talked with a country accent , sang psalms to match , sugared the tisane according to the bigotry or hypocrisy of the patient , was rough with the sick , and harsh with the dying , almost throwing god in their faces , and storming their last moments with angry prayer . </s> </s>

<s> <s> vincent de paul has divinely described the sister of charity in those admirable words in which so much liberty is blended with slavery:  - they will have no other convent but the hospital , no other cell but a hired room , no chapel but the parish church , no cloister beyond the streets or the hospital wards , no walls but obedience , no grating but the fear of god , and no veil but modesty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was a gentle , austere , well - nurtured , cold personwe dare not say a womanwho had never told a falsehood; she was so gentle that she appeared fragile , but she was more solid than granite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she touched the wretched with her delicate and pure fingers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was , so to speak , silence in her language; she only said what was necessary , and possessed an intonation of voice which would at once have edified a confessional and delighted a drawing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this delicacy harmonized with the rough gown , for it formed in this rough contact a continual reminder of heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us dwell on one detail; never to have told a falsehood , never to have said , for any advantage or even indifferently , a thing which was not the truth , the holy truth , was the characteristic feature of sister simplice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was almost celebrated in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity , and the abb suard alludes to sister simplice in a letter to the deaf , mute massieu . </s> </s>

<s> <s> -  the cashier occupied a room exactly under m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about midnight he woke with a start , for he heard in his sleep a noise above his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he listened; it was a footfall coming and going , as if some one were walking about the room above him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he listened more attentively , and recognized m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a moment later the cashier heard something like a wardrobe open and shut; a piece of furniture was moved , there was a silence , and the walking began again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cashier sat up in bed , wide awake , looked out , and through his window noticed on a wall opposite , the red reflection of a lighted window; from the direction of the rays it could only be the window of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the reflection flickered as if it came from a fire rather than a candle , while the shadow of the framework could not be traced , which proved that the window was wide open , and this was a curious fact , considering the cold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cashier fell asleep and woke again some two hours after; the same slow and regular footfall was still audible above his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the reflection was still cast on the wall , but was now pale and quiet , as if it came from a lamp or a candle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the window was still open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is what was occurring in m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the reader has , of course , guessed that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have already looked into the depths of this conscience , and the moment has arrived to look into them again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we do not do this without emotion or tremor , for there is nothing more terrifying than this species of contemplation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a spectacle grander than the sea , and that is the sky; there is a spectacle grander than the sky , and it is the interior of the soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> conscience is the chaos of chimeras , envies , and attempts , the furnace of dreams , the lurking - place of ideas we are ashamed of; it is the pandemonium of sophistry , the battlefield of the passions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at certain hours look through the livid face of a reflecting man , look into his soul , peer into the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beneath the external silence , combats of giants are going on there , such as we read of in homer; mles of dragons and hydras and clouds of phantoms , such as we find in milton; and visionary spirals , as in dante . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a sombre thing is the infinitude which every man bears within him , and by which he desperately measures the volitions of his brain and the actions of his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from this moment , as we have seen , he became another man , and he made himself what the bishop wished to make him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he succeeded in disappearing , sold the bishop' s plate , only keeping the candlesticks as a souvenir , passed through france , reached m , had the idea we have described , accomplished what we have narrated , managed to make himself unseizable and inaccessible , and henceforth settled at m , happy at feeling his conscience saddened by the past , and the first half of his existence contradicted by the last half; he lived peacefully , reassured and trusting , and having but two thoughts ,to hide his name and sanctify his life; escape from men and return to god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these two thoughts were so closely blended in his mind , that they only formed one; they were both equally absorbing and imperious , and governed his slightest actions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> usually they agreed to regulate the conduct of his life; they turned him toward the shadow; they rendered him beneficent and simple , and they counselled him the same things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hence , despite all his caution and prudence , he had kept the bishop' s candlesticks , worn mourning for him , questioned all the little savoyards who passed through the town , inquired after the family at faverolles , and saved the life of old fauchelevent , in spite of the alarming insinuations of javert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed , as we have already remarked , that he thought , after the example of all those who have been wise , holy , and just , that his first duty was not toward himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , we are bound to say , nothing like the present had before occurred; never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings we are describing , entered upon so serious a struggle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he comprehended confusedly , but deeply , from the first words which javert uttered on entering his study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the moment when the name which he had buried so deeply was so strangely pronounced , he was struck with stupor , and , as it were , intoxicated by the sinister peculiarity of his destiny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and through this stupor he felt that quivering which precedes great storms; he bowed like an oak at the approach of a storm , like a soldier before a coming assault . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt the shadows full of thunder and lightning collecting over his head: while listening to javert he had a thought of running off , denouncing himself , taking champmathieu out of prison , and taking his place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would doubtless be grand if , after the bishop' s holy remarks , after so many years of repentance and self - denial , in the midst of a penitence so admirably commenced , this man , even in the presence of such a terrible conjuncture , had not failed for a moment , but continued to march at the same pace toward this open abyss , at the bottom of which heaven was: this would be grand , but it did not take place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are bound to describe all the things that took place in this mind , and cannot say that this was one of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he hastily collected his ideas , stifled his emotion , deferred any resolution with the firmness of terror , deadened himself against what he had to do , and resumed his calmness as a gladiator puts up his buckler . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the remainder of the day he was in the same state ,a hurricane within , a deep tranquillity outside ,and he only took what may be called  - conservative measures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  all was still confused and jumbled in his brain; the trouble in it was so great that he did not see distinctly the outline of any idea , and he could have said nothing about himself , save that he had received a heavy blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went as usual to fantine' s bed of pain , and prolonged his visit , with a kindly instinct , saying to himself that he must act thus , and recommend her to the sisters in the event of his being obliged to go away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt vaguely that he must perhaps go to arras; and , though not the least in the world decided about the journey , he said to himself that , safe from suspicion as he was , there would be no harm in being witness of what might take place , and he hired scaufflaire' s tilbury , in order to be ready for any event . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he dined with considerable appetite , and , on returning to his bed - room , reflected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a moment after , he blew out his light , for it annoyed him , and he fancied that he might be overseen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what he wanted to keep out had entered; what he wished to blind was looking at him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was his conscience , that is to say , god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , at the first moment , he deceived himself; he had a feeling of security and solitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he put in the bolt , he thought himself impregnable; when the candle was out , he felt himself invisible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then regained his self - possession; and he put his elbows on the table , leaned his head on his hand , and began dreaming in the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where am i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> am i not dreaming? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was i told? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it really true that i saw that javert , and that he spoke to me so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seems he resembles me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it possible? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i think that i was so tranquil yesterday , and so far from suspecting anything! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was i doing yesterday at this hour? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they passed like waves , and he clutched his forehead with both hands to stop them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from this tumult which overthrew his wits and reason , and from which he sought to draw an evidence and a resolution , nothing issued but agony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his head was burning; and he went by the window and threw it wide open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first hour passed away thus , but gradually vague features began to shape themselves , and become fixed in his thoughts , and he could observe with the precision of reality some details of the situation , if not its entirety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he began by noticing that however critical and extraordinary his situation might be , he was utterly the master of it , and his stupor was only augmented . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> independently of the stern and religious object he proposed to himself in his actions , all that he had done up to this day was only a hole he dug in which to bury his name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what he had always most feared , in his hours of reflection as in his sleepless nights , was ever to hear that name pronounced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said to himself that this would be to him the end of everything; that on the day when that name re - appeared , it would cause his new life to fade away , and possibly the new soul he had within him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine would come forth more honored , more peaceful , and more respected than ever ,if any one had told him this , he would have shaken his head , and considered such talk insane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his reverie continued to grow clearer , and each moment he comprehended his position better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed to him that he had just awakened from a dream , and that he was descending an incline in the middle of the night , shuddering and recoiling in vain from the brink of an abyss . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he distinctly saw in the shadows an unknown man , a stranger , whom destiny took for him , and thrust into the gulf in his place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in order that the gulf should close , either he or another must fall in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then he said to himself that at this moment he had a substitute ,that it seemed a man of the name of champmathieu had this ill - luck; and that , in future , himself at the bagne in the person of this champmathieu , and present in society under the name of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine , would have nothing more to fear , provided that he did not prevent justice from laying over the head of this champmathieu the stone of infamy which , like the tombstone , falls once and is never raised again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this was so violent and so strange , that he suddenly felt within him that species of indescribable movement which no man experiences more than twice or thrice in his life ,a sort of convulsion of the conscience , which disturbs everything doubtful in the heart , which is composed of irony , joy , and despair , and what might be called an internal burst of laughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he suddenly relit his candle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , what am i afraid of?  -  he said to himself;  - what reason have i to have such thoughts? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am saved , and all is settled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was only one open door through which my past could burst in upon my life: and that door is now walled up forever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that javert , who has so long annoyed me , the formidable instinct which seemed to have scented me , and by heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is henceforth satisfied , he will leave me at peace , for he has got his jean valjean! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is possible that he may wish to leave the town too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and all this has taken place without my interference , and so , what is there so unlucky in it all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on my word , any people who saw me would believe that a catastrophe had befallen me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> providence has done it all , and apparently decrees it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have i the right to derange what he arranges? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it does not concern me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what else can i want? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and why has heaven decreed it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that i may continue what i have begun; that i may do good; that i may one day be a grand and encouraging example; that it may be said that there is after all a little happiness attaching to the penance i have undergone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i really cannot understand why i was so afraid just now about visiting that worthy cur , telling all to him as to a confessor , and asking his advice , for this is certainly what he would have advised me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is settled; i will let matters take their course , and leave the decision to heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he got up from his chair and walked about the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , -  he said ,  - i will think no more of it; i have made up my mind; -  but he felt no joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is no more possible to prevent thought from reverting to an idea than the sea from returning to the shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the sailor this is called the tide , with the culprit it is called remorse; god heaves the soul like the ocean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a few moments , whatever he might do , he resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened , saying what he wished to be silent about , listening to what he did not desire to hear , and yielding to that mysterious power which said to him  - think , -  as it did , two thousand years ago , to another condemned man ,  - go on . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> before going further , and in order to be fully understood , let us dwell on a necessary observation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is certain that men talk to themselves; and there is not a thinking being who has not realized the fact . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is only in this sense that the words frequently employed in this chapter , he said , he exclaimed , must be understood; men talk to themselves , speak to themselves , cry out within themselves , but the external silence is not interrupted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked himself then , what he had arrived at , and cross - questioned himself about the resolution he had formed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he confessed to himself that all he had arranged in his mind was monstrous , and that leaving  - god to act -  was simply horrible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to allow this mistake of destiny and of men to be accomplished , not to prevent it , to lend himself to it , do nothing , in short , was to do everything; it was the last stage of hypocritical indignity! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the first time during eight years this hapless man had the taste of a bad thought and a bad action , and he spat it out in disgust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it for so paltry a thing that he had done all that he had effected? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to be a just man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it not that he craved solely , and that the bishop had ordered him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> close the door on his past? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , great heaven , he opened it again by committing an infamous action . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was becoming a robber once more , and the most odious of robbers! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was becoming an assassin , he was killing , morally killing , a wretched man; he was inflicting on him the frightful living death , the open - air death , which is called the galleys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> falling back into it apparently would be leaving it in reality! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt that the bishop was here , that he was the more present because he was dead , that the bishop was steadfastly looking at him , and that henceforth madeleine the mayor would be an abomination to him , and jean valjean the convict admirable and pure in his sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he must consequently go to arras , deliver the false jean valjean , and denounce the true one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> frightful destiny his! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not obtain sanctity in the sight of heaven unless he returned to infamy in the sight of man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , -  he said ,  - i will make up my mind to this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will do my duty and save this man . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he uttered those words aloud without noticing he had raised his voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fetched his books , verified and put them in order . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he threw into the fire a number of claims he had upon embarrassed tradesmen , and wrote a letter , which he addressed  - to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lafitte , banker , rue d' artois , paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  he then took from his desk a pocket - book , which contained a few bank - notes and the passport he had employed just previously to go to the elections . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> any one who had seen him while he was accomplishing these various acts , with which such grave meditation was mingled , would not have suspected what was taking place in him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at moments his lips moved , at others he raised his head and looked at a part of the wall , as if there were something there which he desired to clear up or question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the letter to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his reverie had not deviated; he continued to see his duty clearly written in luminous letters which flashed before his eyes , and moved about with his glance , name yourself , denounce yourself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could also see the two ideas which had hitherto been the double rule of his lifeto hide his name and sanctify his lifemoving before him as it were in a tangible shape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the first time they seemed to him absolutely distinct , and he saw the difference that separated them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they strove with each other , and he could see them doing so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was thinking , they had grown before his mental eye , and they had now colossal forms , and he fancied he could see a god and a giant wrestling within him , in the infinitude to which we just now alluded , and in the midst of obscurity and flashes of light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt that he was approaching the second decisive moment of his life; that the bishop marked the first phase of his new life , and that this champmathieu marked the second; after the great crisis came the great trial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a thousand thoughts crossed his mind , but they continued to strengthen him in his resolution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at one moment he said to himself that he perhaps regarded the matter too seriously; that , after all , this champmathieu did not concern him , and in any case was a thief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , again , is it proved that he has committed a robbery? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not public prosecutors habitually act in this way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man is believed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at another moment the idea occurred to him that , when he had denounced himself , the heroism of his deed might perhaps be taken into consideration , as well as his life of honesty during the last seven years , and the good he had done the town , and that he would be pardoned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this supposition soon vanished , and he smiled bitterly at the thought that the robbery of the 40 sous from gervais rendered him a relapsed convict; that this affair would certainly be brought forward , and , by the precise terms of the law , sentence him to the galleys for life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned away from all illusions , detached himself more and more from earth , and sought consolation and strength elsewhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said to himself that he must do his duty: that , perhaps , he would not be more wretched after doing it than he would have been had he eluded it: that , if he let matters take their course and remained at m , his good name , good deeds , charity , wealth , popularity , and virtue would be tainted by a crime; and what flavor would all these sacred things have , when attached to this hideous thought; while , if he accomplished his sacrifice , he would mingle a heavenly idea with the galleys , the chain , the green cap , the unrelaxing toil , and the pitiless shame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he said to himself that it was a necessity , that his destiny was thus shaped , that he had no power to derange the arrangements of heaven , and that in any case he must choose either external virtue and internal abomination , or holiness within and infamy outside him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his courage did not fail him in revolving so many mournful ideas , but his brain grew weary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he began thinking involuntarily of other and indifferent matters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his arteries beat violently in his temples , and he was still walking up and down; midnight struck , first from the parish church , and then from the town hall: he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks , and compared the sound of the two bells . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they reminded him that a few days before he had seen an old bell at a marine store , on which was engraved the name antoine albier , romainville . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - ah , yes , -  he said to himself ,  - i had formed the resolution to denounce myself . </s> </s>

<s> <s> hitherto , i have thought of myself and consulted my own convenience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether it suits me to be silent or denounce myselfhide my person or save my soulbe a contemptible and respected magistrate , or an infamous and venerable convictit is always self , nought but self . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this is egotism; under different shapes , ' t is true , but still egotism . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suppose i were to think a little about others! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , let me examine: when i am effaced and forgotten , what will become of all this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i denounce myself , that champmathieu will be set at liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what will occur here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before i came there was nothing of all this; i revived , animated , fertilized , stimulated , and enriched the whole district . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i am gone the soul will be gone; if i withdraw all will die; and then , this woman , who has suffered so greatly , who has so much merit in her fall , and whose misfortune i unwittingly caused , and the child which i intended to go and fetch , and restore to the motherdo not i also owe something to this woman in reparation of the wrong which i have done her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i do not denounce myself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , let me see . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> after asking himself this question , he hesitated , and trembled slightly; but this emotion lasted but a short time , and he answered himself calmly: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , this man will go to the galleys , it is true , but , hang it all! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although i may say to myself that he has not stolen , he has done so! </s> </s>

<s> <s> i keep nothing for myself; but what do i care? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not doing this for myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prosperity of all is increased; trades are revived , factories and forges are multiplied , and thousands of families are happy; the district is populated; villages spring up where there are only farms , and farms where there is nothing; wretchedness disappears , and with it debauchery , prostitution , robbery , murder , all the vices , all the crimesand this poor mother brings up her child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , i was mad , absurd , when i talked about denouncing myself , and i must guard against precipitation . </s> </s>

<s> <s> without the mother seeing her child again , or the child knowing her mother! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and i would fail in my duties to all these poor creatures , and commit such a folly as to denounce myself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us put things at the worst: suppose that i am committing a bad action in this , and that my conscience reproaches me with it some day; there will be devotion and virtue in accepting , for the good of my neighbor , these reproaches , which only weigh on me , and this bad action , which only compromises my own soul . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he got up and began walking up and down again: this time he seemed to be satisfied with himself . </s> </s>

<s> <s> a man must in the end hold on to something , and my mind is made up . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> he looked into the small looking - glass over the mantel - piece , and said to himself ,<s> <s>  - how greatly has forming a resolution relieved me! </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he walked a little way and then stopped short . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are threads which still attach me to jean valjean which must be broken . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> he took his purse from his pocket , and drew a small key out of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he put this key in a lock , the hole of which could scarcely be seen , for it was hidden in the darkest part of the design on the paper that covered the walls . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a sort of false cupboard made between the corner of the wall and the mantel - piece was visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this hiding - place there were only a few rags ,a blue blouse , worn trousers , an old knapsack , and a large thorn - stick shod with iron at both ends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had preserved them , as he had done the candlesticks , that they might constantly remind him of his starting - point; still he hid what came from the galleys , and displayed the candlesticks which came from the bishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a few seconds , the room and opposite wall were lit up with a large red and flickering glow; all was burning , and the thorn - stick crackled and threw out sparks into the middle of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on stooping it could be easily recognized as a coin; it was doubtless the little savoyard' s two - franc piece . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not look at the fire , and continued his walk backwards and forwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all at once his eye fell on the two candlesticks which the fire - light caused to shine vaguely on the mantel - piece . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he seized the candlesticksthere was a fire large enough to destroy their shape , and convert them into unrecognizable ingots . </s> </s>

<s> <s> all at once he fancied he heard a voice cry within him ,  - jean valjean! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean!  -  his hair stood erect , and he became like a man who is listening to a terrible thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , that is right; finish!  -  the voice said:  - complete what you are about; destroy those candlesticks , annihilate that reminiscence! </s> </s>

<s> <s> oh , you scoundrel!  - <s> <s> the perspiration beaded on his forehead , and he fixed his haggard eye upon the candlesticks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the voice within him , however , had not ended yet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - jean valjean! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there will be around you many voices making a great noise , speaking very loud and blessing you , and one which no one will hear , and which will curse you in the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , listen , infamous man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all these blessings will fall back on the ground before reaching heaven , and the curse alone will ascend to god!  - <s> <s> this voice , at first very faint , and which spoke from the obscurest nook of his conscience , had gradually become sonorous and formidable , and he now heard it in his ear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is there any one here?  -  he asked , in a loud voice and wildly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there can be nobody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he placed the candlesticks on the mantel - piece , and then resumed that melancholy , mournful walk , which aroused the sleeper underneath him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this walking relieved him , and at the same time intoxicated him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it appears sometimes as if on supreme occasions people move about to ask advice of everything they pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he now recoiled with equal horror from the two resolutions he had formed in turn; the two ideas that counselled him seemed each as desperate as the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a fatality that this champmathieu should be taken for him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> denounce himself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> great heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give himself up! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would be forced to bid adieu to this good , pure , radiant life ,to the respect of all classes ,to honor , to liberty! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all appeared charming to him at this moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> great god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of all this , there would be the gang , the red jacket , the chain on his foot , fatigue , the dungeon , the camp - bed , and all the horrors he knew! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at his age , after all he had borne! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would be different were he still young . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to be old , coarsely addressed by anybody , searched by the jailer , and receive blows from the keeper' s stick! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to thrust his naked feet into iron - shod shoes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to offer his leg morning and night to the man who examines the fetters! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , what misery! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and whatever he might do , he ever fell back into this crushing dilemma , which was the basis of his reverie ,remain in paradise , and become a demon there; or re - enter hell , and become an angel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what should he do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the trouble , from which he had escaped with such difficulty , was again let loose on him , and his thoughts became composed once more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they assumed something stupefied and mechanical , which is peculiar to despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the name of romainville incessantly returned to his mind , with two lines of a song which he had formerly heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at certain moments , he struggled against his lassitude , and tried to recapture his intelligence; he tried to set himself , for the last time , the problem over which he had fallen in a state of exhaustion ,must he denounce himself , or must he be silent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not succeed in seeing anything distinct , the vague outlines of all the reasonings sketched in by his reverie were dissipated in turn like smoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all his irresolution had seized him again , and he was no further advanced than at the beginning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus the wretched soul writhed in agony! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eighteen hundred years before this unhappy man , the mysterious being in whom are embodied all the sanctities and sufferings of humanity had also , while the olive - trees shuddered in the fierce wind of the infinite , long put away with his hand the awful cup which appeared to him , dripping with shadow and overflowing with darkness in the starry depths . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three a . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had struck , and he had been walking about in this way for five hours without a break , when he fell into his chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fell asleep , and had a dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this dream , like most dreams , was only connected with his situation by something poignant and mournful , but it made an impression on him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was upon a plain , a large mournful plain , on which no grass grew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it did not seem to me to be day , but it was not night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we spoke about a woman , formerly a neighbor of ours , who had always worked with her window open , since she had occupied a front room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we saw a man pass close by us; he was a perfectly naked man , of the color of ashes , mounted on a horse of an earthen color . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man had no hair , and i could see his skull , and the veins on his skull . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he held in his hand a wand , which was supple as a vine - twig and heavy as lead . </s> </s> 
' <s> <s>  - it was a hollow way in which not a bramble or even a patch of moss could be seen; all was earth - colored , even the sky . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after going a few yards , i received no answer when i spoke , and i noticed that my brother was no longer with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i entered a village that i saw , and i fancied that it must be romainville . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first street i entered was deserted; i entered a second street , and behind the angle formed by the two streets a man was standing against the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i asked this man ,  - what is this place? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where am i?  -  but he gave me no answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind the door of this room there was a man leaning against the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i asked him ,  - to whom does this house belong? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where am i?  -  but the man gave me no answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where am i?  -  but he made me no answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the streets were deserted , all the doors open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not a living soul passed along the street , moved in the rooms , or walked in the gardens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never saw more than one at a time , and these men looked at me as i passed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i left the village and began walking about the fields . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of some time i turned back and saw a great crowd coming after me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i recognized all the men whom i had seen in the town , and they had strange heads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did not appear to be in a hurry , and yet they walked faster than i , and made no noise in walking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the faces of these men were earth - colored . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the man i had seen first and questioned when i entered the town said to me ,  - where are you going? </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he woke up , chilled to the marrow , for a wind , cold as the morning breeze , was shaking the open window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as his mind was half submerged in the mist of dreams , he thought ,  - there are no stars in the sky: they are on the earth now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  a second sound like the first completely woke him , and he perceived that those two stars were carriage lamps , and by the light which they projected he could distinguish the shape of the vehicle; it was a tilbury , in which a small white horse was harnessed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sound he had heard was the pawing of the horse' s hoof on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who can have come at so early an hour?  - <s> <s> at this moment there was a gentle tap at his bed - room door; he shuddered from head to foot , and shouted in a terrible voice ,  - who' s there?  - <s> <s> some one replied ,  - i , sir , -  and he recognized his old servant' s voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , -  he continued ,  - what is it?  - <s> <s>  - it is getting on for four o' clock , sir . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - what has that to do with me?  - <s> <s>  - the tilbury has come , sir . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - what tilbury?  - <s> <s>  - did you not order one?  - <s> <s>  - no , -  he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the ostler says that he has come to fetch m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> le maire . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - what ostler?  - <s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scaufflaire' s . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> this name made him start as if a flash of lightning had passed before his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes , -  he repeated ,  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a lengthened silence , during which he stupidly examined the candle flame and rolled up some of the wax in his fingers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old woman , who was waiting , at length mustered up courage to raise her voice again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> le maire , what answer am i to give?  - <s> <s>  - say it is quite right , and that i shall be down directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wheels were armed with those long offensive axle - trees , which kept other carriages at a distance , and may still be seen on german roads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these vehicles , like which we have nothing at the present day , had something ugly and humpbacked about them , and when you saw them pass at a distance or creeping up a hill on the horizon , they resembled those insects called , we think , termites , and which with a small body drag a heavy burden after them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they went very fast , however , and the mail which left arras at one in the morning , after the paris mail had arrived , reached m a little before five a . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this morning , the mail - cart , just as it entered m , and while turning a corner , ran into a tilbury drawn by a white horse , coming in the opposite direction , and in which there was only one sitter , a man wrapped in a cloak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wheel of the tilbury received a rather heavy blow , and though the driver of the mail - cart shouted to the man to stop , he did not listen , but went on at a smart trot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the man is in a deuce of a hurry , -  said the courier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where was he going? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not have told . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why was he hurrying? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was going onwards unthinkingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he buried himself in the darkness as in a gulf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was going on in him no one could tell , but all will understand it ,for what man has not entered , at least once in his life , this obscure cavern of the unknown? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , he had settled , decided , and done nothing; not one of the acts of his conscience had been definitive , and he was still as unsettled as at the beginning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why was he going to arras? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he repeated what he had already said on hiring the gig of scaufflairethat , whatever the result might be , there would be no harm in seeing with his own eyes , and judging matters for himselfthat this was prudent; and he was bound to know what was going onthat he could not decide anything till he had observed and examinedthat , at a distance , a man made mountains of molehillsthat after all , when he had seen this champmathieu , his conscience would probably be quietly relieved , and he could let the scoundrel go to the galleys in his place: that javert would be there and the three convicts who had known him ,but , nonsense! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they would not recognize him , for all conjectures and suppositions were fixed on this champmathieu , and there is nothing so obstinate as conjectures and suppositions ,and that hence he incurred no danger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was doubtless a black moment , but he would emerge from it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after all , he held his destiny , however adverse it might try to be , in his own hands , and was master of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he clung wildly to the latter thought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while reflecting he lashed the horse , which was going at that regular and certain trot which covers two leagues and a half in an hour; and as the gig advanced , he felt something within him recoil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he watched the horizon grow white; he looked , without seeing them , at all the cold figures of a winter dawn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not see them , but unconsciously , and through a sort of almost physical penetration , these black outlines of trees and hills added something gloomy and sinister to the violent state of his soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each time that he passed one of those isolated houses which skirt high roads , he said to himself:  - and yet there are people asleep in them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this horse , as scaufflaire had said , belonged to that small boulonnais breed , which has too large a head , too much stomach , and not enough neck , but which also has a wide crupper , lean , slender legs , and a solid hoof: it is an ugly but strong and healthy breed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the capital little beast had done five leagues in two hours , and had not turned a hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not get out of the tilbury; the ostler who brought the oats suddenly stooped down and examined the left wheel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you going far in this state?  -  the man said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he answered almost without emerging from his reverie ,<s> <s>  - why do you ask?  - <s> <s>  - have you come any distance?  -  the ostler continued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - five leagues . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he jumped out of the tilbury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what are you saying , my friend?  - <s> <s>  - i say that it is a miracle you and your horse did not roll into a ditch by the road - side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the blow dealt it by the mail - cart had broken two spokes , and almost carried away the axle - tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my good fellow , -  he said to the ostler ,  - is there a wheelwright here?  - <s> <s>  - of course , sir . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - he lives close by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can you mend this wheel?  - <s> <s>  - yes , sir . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - when can i start again?  - <s> <s>  - to - morrow: there is a good day' s work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you in a hurry , sir?  - <s> <s>  - in a great hurry: i must set out again in an hour at the latest . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - it is impossible , sir . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - impossible . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - my business cannot wait till to - morrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suppose , instead of mending this wheel , you were to put another on?  - <s> <s>  - how so?  - <s> <s>  - you are a wheelwright , and have probably a wheel you can sell me , and then i could set out again directly . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i have no ready - made wheel to suit your gig , for wheels are sold in pairs , and it is not easy to match one . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - at any rate try . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you take such good care of gigs you hire , that if i had one i would not let it to you . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - well , one to sell me?  - <s> <s>  - i have not one . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - what , not a tax - cart? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not particular , as you see . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - this is a small place . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - where are you going to , sir?  - <s> <s>  - to arras . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - and you wish to arrive to - day?  - <s> <s>  - certainly . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - by taking post - horses?  - <s> <s>  - why not?  - <s> <s>  - does it make any difference to you if you reach arras at four o' clock to - morrow morning?  - <s> <s>  - of course it does . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the relays are badly served , and the horses are out at work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will have to wait three or four hours , sir , at each station , and only go at a foot - pace , for there are many hills to ascend . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - well , i will ride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take the horse out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i suppose i can purchase a saddle here?  - <s> <s>  - of course , but will this horse carry a saddle?  - <s> <s>  - no , i remember now that it will not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to go to arras without a break?  - <s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first place , you would have to buy it , as you are a stranger , but you would not find one to buy or hire for five hundred francs ,not for a thousand . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - hang it!  - <s> <s>  - is there not the arras mail - cart? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when does that pass?  - <s> <s>  - not till to - night . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will take a whole day in mending that wheel?  - <s> <s>  - an honest day . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - suppose you employed two workmen?  - <s> <s>  - ay , if i had ten . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - suppose the spokes were tied with cords?  - <s> <s>  - what is to be done with the axle? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , the felloe is in a bad state . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he felt an immense joy , for it was evident that providence was interfering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> providence had broken the tilbury wheel and stopped his journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not yielded to this species of first summons; he had made every possible effort to continue his journey; he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all resources; he had not recoiled before the season , fatigue , or expense; and he had nothing to reproach himself with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he did not go farther , it did not concern him; it was not his fault , it was not the doing of his conscience , but of providence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he breathed freely and fully for the first time since javert' s visit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said to himself that he had done all in his power , and at present need only return home quietly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had the conversation with the wheelwright taken place in an inn - room , it would probably have not been heard by any one ,matters would have remained in this state , and we should probably not have had to record any of the following events; but the conversation took place in the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> any colloquy in the street inevitably produces a crowd , for there are always people who only ask to be spectators . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was questioning the wheelwright , some passers - by stopped around , and a lad to whom no one paid any attention , after listening for some moments , ran off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the instant when the traveller made up his mind to turn back , this boy returned , accompanied by an old woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , -  the woman said ,  - my boy tells me that you wish to hire a conveyance?  - <s> <s> this simple remark , made by an old woman led by a child , made the perspiration pour down his back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fancied he saw the hand which had let him loose reappear in the shadow behind him , ready to clutch him again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he replied ,<s> <s>  - yes , my good woman , i want to hire a gig . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> and he hastily added ,  - but there is not one in the town . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - yes there is , -  said the old woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where?  -  the wheelwright remarked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at my house , -  the old crone answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he gave a start , for the fatal hand had seized him again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor woman really had a sort of wicker - cart under a shed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wheelwright and the ostler , sorry to see the traveller escape them , interfered: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was a frightful rattle - trap , and had no springs ,it is a fact that the inside seats were hung with leathern strapsthe rain got into itthe wheels were rusty , and ready to fall to piecesit would not go much farther than the tilburythe gentleman had better not get into it , - and so on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this was true; but the rattle - trap , whatever it might be , rolled on two wheels , and could go to arras . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the moment when the cart moved ahead , he confessed to himself that an instant before he had felt a sort of joy at the thought that he could not continue his journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he examined this joy with a sort of passion , and found it absurd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why did he feel joy at turning back? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after all , he was making this journey of his free will , and no one forced him to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and assuredly nothing could happen , except what he liked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he was leaving hesdin , he heard a voice shouting to him ,  - stop , stop!  -  he stopped the cart with a hurried movement in which there was something feverish and convulsive that resembled joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , -  he said ,  - it was i who got you the cart . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he who gave to all , and so easily , considered this demand exorbitant , and almost odious . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he flogged his horse , which started again at a smart trot . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the landlady entered the stable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you not wish to breakfast , sir?  - <s> <s>  - it is true , -  said he ,  - i am very hungry . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he followed the woman , who had a healthy , ruddy face; she led him to a ground - floor room , in which were tables covered with oil - cloth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - make haste , -  he remarked ,  - for i am in a great hurry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that was the trouble , -  he thought;  - i had not breakfasted . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he pounced upon the bread , bit a mouthful , and then slowly laid it back on the table , and did not touch it again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a wagoner was sitting at another table , and he said to him ,<s> <s>  - why is their bread so bitter?  - <s> <s> the wagoner was a german , and did not understand him; he returned to his horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was he thinking of? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as in the morning , he looked at the trees , the roofs , the ploughed fields , and the diversities of a landscape which every turn in the road changes , as he passed them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to see a thousand different objects for the first and last time is most melancholy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shadow and light are blended; after a dazzling comes an eclipse; every event is a turn in the road , and all at once you are old . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twilight was setting in at the moment when the school - boys , leaving school , saw this traveller enter tinques . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not halt there , but as he left the village , a road - mender , who was laying stones , raised his head , and said to him ,<s> <s>  - your horse is very tired . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the poor brute , in fact , could not get beyond a walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - if you go at that pace , you will not reach it very soon . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he stopped his horse , and asked the road - mender ,<s> <s>  - how far is it from here to arras?  - <s> <s>  - nearly seven long leagues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the post - book says only five and a quarter leagues . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - ah -  the road - mender continued ,  - you do not know that the road is under repair; you will find it cut up about a mile farther on , and it is impossible to pass . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - indeed!  - <s> <s>  - you must take the road on the left , that runs to carency , and cross the river; when you reach camblin you will turn to the right , for it is the mont st . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - you do not belong to these parts?  - <s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i must be there to - night . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - that is different . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in that case go back to the inn all the same , and hire a second horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stable boy will act as your guide across the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a stable lad , who called himself a postilion , was sitting on the shafts of the cart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still he felt that he had lost time , for it was now dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they entered the cross - road , and it soon became frightful; the cart tumbled from one rut into another , but he said to the postilion ,<s> <s>  - keep on at a trot , and i will give you a double fee . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> in one of the jolts the whipple - tree broke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the whipple - tree is broken , sir , -  said the postilion ,  - and i do not know how to fasten my horse , and the road is very bad by night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you will go back and sleep at tinques , we can get to arras at an early hour to - morrow . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he answered ,  - have you a piece of rope and a knife?  - <s> <s>  - yes , sir . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he cut a branch and made a whipple - tree; it was a further loss of twenty minutes , but they started again at a gallop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cold pierced him , for he had eaten nothing since the previous morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he vaguely recalled his other night - excursion , on the great plain of d eight years before , and it seemed to him to be yesterday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a clock struck from a distant steeple , and he asked the lad ,<s> <s>  - what o' clock is that?  - <s> <s>  - seven , sir , and we shall be at arras by eight , for we have only three leagues to go . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> at this moment he made for the first time this reflectionand considered it strange that it had not occurred to him beforethat all the trouble he was taking was perhaps thrown away; he did not even know the hour for the trial , and he might at least have asked about that; it was extravagant to go on thus , without knowing if it would be of any service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would arrive when it was all over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the postilion flogged the horses; they had crossed the river and left mont st hoy behind them; the night was growing more and more dark . </s> </s>

<s> <s> madeleine arrived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the morning she was gloomy , said little , and made folds in sheets , while murmuring in a low voice , and calculating what seemed to be distances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her eyes were hollow and fixed , they seemed almost extinct , and then , at moments , they were relit , and flashed like stars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seems as if , on the approach of a certain dark hour , the brightness of heaven fills those whom the brightness of earth is quitting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each time that sister simplice asked her how she was , she invariably answered ,  - well , but i should like to see m . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> a few months previously , at the time when fantine lost her last modesty , her last shame , and her last joy , she was the shadow of herself: now she was the ghost . </s> </s>

<s> <s> how illness improvises old age! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at mid - day , the physician returned , wrote a prescription , inquired whether m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then fantine turned and looked at the door: but no one entered , and the door was not opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she remained thus for a quarter of an hour , with her eyes fixed on the door , motionless , and holding her breath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the nun did not dare speak to her , and as the clock struck the quarter , fantine fell back on her pillow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she said nothing , and began again making folds in the sheet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each time the clock struck fantine sat up , looked at the door , and then fell back again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her thoughts could be clearly read , but she did not say a word , complain , or make any accusation: she merely coughed in a sad way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed as if something dark was settling down on her , for she was livid and her lips were blue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she smiled every now and then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when five o' clock struck , the nun heard her say very softly and sweetly ,  - as i am going away to - morrow , it was wrong of him not to come to - day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  sister simplice herself was surprised at m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine' s delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the mean while fantine looked up at the top of her bed , and seemed to be trying to remember something: all at once she began singing in a voice faint as a sigh . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the clock struck , and fantine did not seem to hear it: she appeared not to pay any attention to things around her . </s> </s>

<s> <s> while the two women were whispering with their backs turned to fantine , the sister questioning , and the servant conjecturing , fantine , with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies which blend the free movements of health with the frightful weakness of death , had knelt in bed , with her two clenched hands supported by the pillow , and listened with her head thrust between the curtains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine: why do you whisper? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is he doing , and why does he not come?  - <s> <s> her voice was so loud and hoarse that the two women fancied it a man' s voice , and they turned round in alarm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - answer!  -  fantine cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servant stammered ,<s> <s>  - the portress told me that he could not come to - day . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - my child , -  the sister said ,  - be calm and lie down again . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> fantine , without changing her attitude , went on in a loud voice and with an accent at once imperious and heart - rending ,<s> <s>  - he cannot come: why not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know the reason . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the servant hastily whispered in the nun' s ear ,  - tell her that he is engaged at the municipal council . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> sister simplice blushed slightly , for it was a falsehood that the servant proposed to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the other hand it seemed to her that telling the patient the truth would doubtless deal her a terrible blow , and this was serious in fantine' s present condition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the blush lasted but a little while: the sister fixed her calm sad eye on fantine , and said ,<s> <s>  - the mayor is gone on a journey . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> fantine rose and sat up on her heels , her eyes sparkled , and an ineffable joy shone on her sad face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has gone to fetch cosette , -  she exclaimed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she had finished she said ,  - my sister , i am willing to lie down again and do everything you wish: i was naughty just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ask your pardon for having spoken so loud , for i know that it was wrong , good sister; but , look you , i am so happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god is good , and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine is good: only think , he has gone to montfermeil to fetch my little cosette . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> she lay down again , helped the nun to smooth her pillow , and kissed a little silver cross she wore on her neck , and which sister simplice had given her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my child , -  the sister said ,  - try to go to sleep now , and do not speak any more . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - he started this morning for paris , and indeed had no occasion to go there; for montfermeil is a little to the left before you get there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you remember how he said to me yesterday when i asked him about cosette ,  - soon , soon - ? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wishes to offer me a surprise , for , do you know , he made me sign a letter to get her back from the thnardiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for they are paid; the authorities would not allow a child to be kept , for now there is nothing owing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sister , do not make me signs that i must not speak , for i am extremely happy: i am going on very well , i feel no pain at all; i am going to see cosette again , and i even feel very hungry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is nearly five years since i saw her: you cannot imagine how a mother clings to her child ,and then she must be so pretty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she has such pretty pink fingers , and she will have beautiful hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i call her cosette , but her real name is euphrasie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good lord! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how wrong it is for a mother to be so many years without seeing her child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , how kind it is of the mayor to go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it true that it is so cold? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope he took his cloak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he will be here again to - morrow , will he not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and we will make a holiday of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to - morrow morning , sister , you will remind me to put on my little cap with the lace border . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> montfermeil is a great distance , and i came from there to this town on foot , and it took me a long time; but the stage - coaches travel so quickly! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how far is it to montfermeil?  - <s> <s> the sister , who had no notion of distances , answered ,  - oh , i believe he can be here to - morrow . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - to - morrow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to - morrow!  -  said fantine;  - i shall see cosette to - morrow , my good sister! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not ill now; i feel wild , and would dance if you permitted me . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> any one who had seen her a quarter of an hour before would not have understood it; she was now quite flushed , she spoke with an eager natural voice , and her whole face was a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at times she laughed while speaking to herself in a low voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well!  -  the nun said ,  - you are now happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so obey me and do not speak any more . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> fantine laid her head on the pillow , and said in a low voice ,  - yes , lie down , behave yourself , as you are going to have your child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sister simplice is right: all in this place are right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sister closed the curtains , hoping she would fall off to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the physician arrived between seven and eight o' clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hearing no sound , he fancied fantine asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he entered softly and walked up to the bed on tip - toe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he opened the curtains , and by the light of the lamp saw fantine' s large calm eyes fixed on him . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the physician took sister simplice on one side who explained the matter to him: that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine was absent for a day or two , and being in doubt they had not thought it right to undeceive the patient , who fancied that he had gone to montfermeil , and she might possibly be in the right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she said to him ,<s> <s>  - in the morning , when the poor darling wakes , i will say good - day to her , and at night i , who do not sleep , will listen to her sleeping . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - give me your hand , -  said the physician . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh yes , you do not know that i am cured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cosette arrives to - morrow . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the physician was surprised to find her better: the oppression was slighter , her pulse had regained strength , and a sort of altogether unlooked - for life reanimated the poor exhausted being . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doctor , -  she continued ,  - has the sister told you that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine has gone to fetch my darling?  - <s> <s> the physician recommended silence , and that any painful emotion should be avoided: he prescribed a dose of quinine , and if the fever returned in the night , a sedative; and as he went away , he said to the sister:  - she is better . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> it was nearly eight in the evening when the cart we left on the road drove under the archway of the post - house at arras . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had taken fourteen hours in a journey for which he had allowed himself six . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlady came in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you sleep here , sir?  - <s> <s> he nodded in the negative . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - is not the postoffice in this house?  - <s> <s>  - yes , sir . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the landlady led him to the office , where he showed his passport , and inquired whether he could return to m the same night by the mail - cart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only one seat was vacant , and he took it and paid for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not fail , sir , -  said the clerk ,  - to be here at one o' clock precisely . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> this done , he left the hotel , and began walking about the streets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a citizen came toward him with a lantern , whom , after some hesitation , he resolved to address , though not till he had looked before and behind him , as if afraid lest anybody should overhear the question he was about to ask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you be kind enough to tell me the way to the courts of justice , sir?  -  he said . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - are the assizes held there?  -  he asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course , sir: you must know that what is now the prefecture was the bishop' s palace before the revolution . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> on the road , the citizen said to him ,<s> <s>  - if you wish to witness a trial you are rather late , for the court usually closes at six o' clock . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> however , when they arrived in the great square the old man showed him four lofty lighted windows in a vast gloomy building . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you see those four windows? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they belong to the assize courts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it a criminal offence , or are you a witness?  - <s> <s> he answered ,<s> <s>  - i have not come for any trial: i only wish to speak to a solicitor . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - that is different . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he followed the old man' s instructions , and a few minutes later was in a large hall , in which there were a good many people , and groups of robed barristers were gossiping together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is always a thing that contracts the heart , to see these assemblies of men dressed in black , conversing in a low voice on the threshold of a court of justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all such groups appear to the thoughtful observer so many gloomy hives , in which buzzing minds build in community all sorts of dark edifices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this hall , which was large and only lighted by one lamp , served as a waiting - room: and folding - doors , at this moment closed , separated it from the grand chamber in which the assizes were being held . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the obscurity was so great , that he was not afraid of addressing the first barrister he came across . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how is it going , sir?  -  he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is finished . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - finished!  -  this word was repeated with such an accent , that the barrister turned round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was a verdict of guilty brought in?  - <s> <s>  - of course; it could not possibly be otherwise . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - the galleys?  - <s> <s>  - for life . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he continued in a voice so faint that it was scarce audible ,<s> <s>  - then , the identity was proved?  - <s> <s>  - what identity?  -  the barrister retorted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to whom were you referring , pray?  - <s> <s>  - to nobody; but as the trial is over , how is it that the court is still lighted?  - <s> <s>  - it is for the other trial , which began about two hours back . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - what other trial?  - <s> <s>  - oh , it is clear too; he is a sort of beggar , a relapsed galley slave , who has been robbing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i forget his name , but he has a regular bandit face , on the strength of which i would send him to the galleys if for nothing else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not think so , for it is very full . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , the trial is suspended , and some persons have gone out . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - which is the way in?  - <s> <s>  - by that large door . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the barrister left him; in a few minutes he had experienced almost simultaneously , and confusedly blended , every emotion possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the words of this indifferent person had by turns pierced his heart like needles of ice and like red - hot sword - blades . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he found that the trial was not over , he breathed again; but he could not have said whether what he felt were satisfaction or pain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  this man had stolen apples , but it was proved that he had already been at the toulon galleys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his examination and the deposition of the witnesses were over; but there were still the speech for the defence and the summing up , and hence it would not be finished till midnight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man would probably be condemned , for the public prosecutor was sharp , and did not let his accused escape; he was a witty fellow who wrote verses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an usher was standing near the door communicating with the court , and he asked him ,<s> <s>  - will this door be opened soon?  - <s> <s>  - it will not be opened , -  said the usher . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will it not be opened when the court resumes its sitting?  - <s> <s>  - it has resumed , -  the usher replied ,  - but the door will not be opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door is closed , and no one can go in . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the usher added after a pause , - there are certainly two or three seats behind the president , but he only admits public officials to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he withdrew with hanging head , crossed the waiting - room , and slowly went down the stairs , hesitating at every step . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on reaching the landing he leaned against the banisters and folded his arms; but all at once he took his pocket - book , tore a leaf from it , wrote in pencil upon it ,  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine , mayor of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>; -  then he hurried up the stairs , cleft the crowd , walked up to the usher , handed him the paper , and said to him with an air of authority , - hand this to the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without suspecting the fact , the mayor of m enjoyed a species of celebrity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in addition to the considerable service he had done the chief town , by restoring the glass - bead trade , there was not one of the one hundred and forty parishes in the bailiwick of m which was not indebted to him for some kindness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had ever assisted and promoted , when necessary , the trades of other departments: thus he had supported with his credit and funds , the tulle factory at boulogne , the flax - spinning machine at nivers , and the hydraulic manufacture of canvas at bourbus sur cauche . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine was everywhere pronounced with veneration , and arras and douai envied the fortunate little town of m its mayor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the usher discreetly opened the door of the judges'  robing room , leaned over the president' s chair , and handed him the paper , adding ,  - this gentleman wishes to hear the trial , -  the president made a deferential movement , took up a pen , wrote a few words at the foot of the paper , and returned it to the usher , saying , - show him in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time the usher handed him the paper; he unfolded it , and as he happened to be near the lamps he was able to read ,  - the president of the assize court presents his respects to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he followed the usher , and a few minutes later found himself alone in a room of severe appearance , lighted by two wax candles standing on a green - baize covered table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he still had in his ears the last words of the usher , who had just left him ,  - you are in the judges'  chamber; you have only to turn the handle of that door , and you will find yourself in court behind the president' s chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  these words were mingled in his thoughts with a confused recollection of narrow passages and dark staircases , which he had just passed through . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he tried to collect himself , but could not succeed; for it is especially in the hours when men have the most need of thought that all the threads are broken in the brain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was at the actual spot where the judges deliberate and pass sentence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he gazed with stupid tranquillity at this peaceful and yet formidable room , in which so many existences had been broken , where his name would be echoed ere long , and which his destiny was traversing at this moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not eaten for more than twenty - four hours , he was exhausted by the jolting of the cart , but he did not feel it; it seemed to him that he did not feel anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he walked up to a black frame hanging on the wall , and which contained under glass an autograph letter of jean nicolas pache , mayor of paris , and minister , dated , doubtless in error , juin 9 an ii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , and in which pache sent to the commune a list of the ministers and deputies under arrest at their own houses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while thinking , he turned , and his eyes met the brass handle of the door that separated him from the assize court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had almost forgotten this door , but his eye , at first calm , rested on it , then became wild and fixed , and was gradually filled with terror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> drops of perspiration started out from his hair and streamed down his temples . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was no longer in that room , but in a passage , a long narrow passage , cut up by steps and wickets , making all sorts of turns , lit up here and there by reflectors like the night - lamps for the sick ,the passage by which he had come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he breathed , he listened , not a sound behind him , not a sound before him , and he began to fly as if he were pursued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then standing there alone , trembling from cold , and perhaps from something else , he thought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he entered the judges chamber , and the first thing he saw was the handle of the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this handle , which was round and made of polished brass , shone for him like a terrific star; he looked at it as a sheep would look at the eye of a tiger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his eyes would not leave it , and from time to time he took a step which brought him nearer to the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all at once , and without knowing how , he found himself close to the door; he convulsively seized the handle , and the door opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was in the assize court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but all this yet produced an austere and august impression , for the grand human thing called law , and the great divine thing called justice , could be felt in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one in this crowd paid any attention to him , for all eyes converged on a single point ,a wooden bench placed against a little door , along the wall on the left of the president; on this bench , which was illumined by several candles , sat a man between two gendarmes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man was the man; he did not seek him , he saw him; his eyes went there naturally , as if they had known beforehand where that face was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fancied he saw himself , aged , not absolutely alike in face , but exactly similar in attitude and appearance , with his bristling hair , with his savage restless eyeballs , and the blouse , just as he was on the day when he entered d , full of hatred , and concealing in his mind that hideous treasure of frightful thoughts which he had spent nineteen years in collecting on the pavement of the bagne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said to himself with a shudder ,  - my god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall i become again like that?  -  this being appeared to be at least sixty years of age; he had something about him rough , stupid , and startled . </s> </s>

<s> <s> these mournful things he found again ,they were there , stirring , existing; it was no longer an effort of his memory , a mirage of his mind; they were real gendarmes , real judges , a real crowd , and real men in flesh and bone . </s> </s>

<s> <s> never! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and by a tragic sport of fate which made all his ideas terrible and rendered him nearly mad , it was another himself who was there . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the accusation said , - we have got hold not only of a fruit - stealer , a marauder , but we hold under our hand a bandit , a man who has broken his ban , an ex - convict , a most dangerous villain , a malefactor of the name of jean valjean , whom justice has been seeking for a long time , and who , eight years ago , on leaving toulon , committed a highway robbery with violence on a savoyard lad , called little gervais , a crime provided for by article 383 of the penal code , for which we intend to prosecute him hereafter , when the identity has been judicially proved . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he looks like a brute now , but in that case age has brutalized him , for he was cunning at the hulks . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - go and sit down , -  said the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - prisoner , remain standing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was serving his time at toulon , whence he had been fetched for this trial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his mates at the galleys had surnamed him je - nie - dieu . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the president addressed him much as he had done brevet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the moment when he reminded him that his degradation robbed him of the right of taking an oath , chenildieu raised his head and looked boldly at the crowd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the president begged him to reflect , and asked him if he still persisted in recognizing the prisoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should think i do! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , we were fastened to the same chain for five years! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this second convict for life , who had been fetched from the galleys and was dressed in red like chenildieu , was a peasant of lourdes and a half - bear of the pyrenees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had guarded sheep in the mountains , and had gradually drifted into brigandage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cochepaille was no less savage , and appeared even more stupid , than the prisoner; he was one of those wretched men whom nature has outlined as wild beasts and whom society finishes as galley - slaves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the president tried to move him by a few grave and pathetic words , and asked him , like the two others , whether he still persisted , without any hesitation or trouble , in recognizing the man standing before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is jean valjean , -  said cochepaille . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prisoner himself listened to them with that amazed face which , according to the indictment , was his principal means of defence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was plain that the man was lost . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> it was he in truth; the clerk' s lamp lit up his face; he held his hat in his hand , there was no disorder in his attire , and his coat was carefully buttoned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was very pale and trembled slightly; and his hair , which had been gray when he arrived at arras , was now perfectly white; it had turned so during the hour he had passed in the court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every head was raised , the sensation was indescribable , and there was a momentary hesitation among the spectators . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they could not believe that this tranquil man could have uttered that terrific cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this indecision lasted but a few moments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before the president and the public prosecutor could say a word , before the gendarmes and ushers could make a move , the man , whom all still called at this moment m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine , had walked up to the witnesses , brevet , chenildieu , and cochepaille . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you not recognize me?  -  he asked them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine turned to the jury and the court , and said in a gentle voice ,<s> <s>  - gentlemen of the jury , acquit the prisoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man you are seeking is not he , fori am jean valjean . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> not a breath was drawn ,the first commotion of astonishment had been succeeded by a sepulchral silence; all felt that species of religious terror which seizes on a crowd when something grand is being accomplished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the president' s face , however , displayed sympathy and sorrow; he exchanged a rapid look with the public prosecutor , and a few words in a low voice with the assistant judges . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then turned to the spectators , and asked with an accent which all understood ,<s> <s>  - is there a medical man present?  - <s> <s> the public prosecutor then said ,<s> <s>  - gentlemen of the jury , the strange and unexpected incident which has disturbed the trial inspires us , as it does yourselves , with a feeling which we need not express . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these are the words he spoke; we produce them literally as they were written down by one of the witnesses of this scene , and as they still live in the ears of those who heard them just forty years ago: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thank you , sir , but i am not mad , as you will soon see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am the only man who sees clearly here , and i am telling you the truth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what i am doing at this moment god above is looking at , and that is sufficient for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can seize me , for here i am; and yet i did my best . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are many things i cannot tell you , as i am not going to describe my life to you , for one day it will be known . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> listen , gentlemen of the court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be good enough to bear that fact in mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before i went to toulon i was a poor peasant with but little intelligence , a sort of idiot; the galleys changed me: i was stupid , and i became wicked; i was a log , and i became a brand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , forgive me , you cannot understand what i am saying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at my house the two - franc piece i stole seven years ago from little gervais will be found among the ashes in the fire - place . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this is afflicting; at least do not condemn this man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , i wish that javert were here , for he would recognize me!  - <s> <s> no pen could render the benevolent and sombre melancholy of the accent which accompanied these words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brevet , do you not remember me?  -  he broke off , hesitated for a moment , and said ,<s> <s>  - can you call to mind the checkered braces you used to wear at the galleys?  - <s> <s> brevet gave a start of surprise and looked at him from head to foot in terror . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it is the property of sublime spectacles to seize on all minds and make spectators of all the witnesses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the appearance , of this man had been sufficient to throw a bright light on an affair which was so obscure a moment previously: without needing any explanation , the entire crowd understood , as if through a sort of electric revelation , at once and at a glance the simple and magnificent story of a man who denounced himself in order that another man might not be condemned in his place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was an impression which quickly passed away , but at the moment was irresistible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the public prosecutor knows who i am , he knows where i am going , and he will order me to be arrested when he thinks proper . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he walked towards the door , and not a voice was raised , not an arm stretched forth to prevent him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he slowly walked on; it was never known who opened the door , but it is certain that he found it opened when he reached it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i presume that all of you consider me worthy of pity? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> great god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i think of what i was on the point of doing , i consider myself worthy of envy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , i should have preferred that all this had not taken place . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he answered in a low voice ,<s> <s>  - how is the poor creature?  - <s> <s>  - not so bad just at present , but she has frightened us terribly . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - of course; but it will take at least two or three days . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - if she were not to see you till then , sir , -  the sister continued timidly ,  - she would not know that you had returned; it would be easy to keep her quiet , and when her child arrived , she would naturally think that you had returned with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that would not be telling a falsehood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine appeared to reflect for a few moments , and then said with his calm gravity ,<s> <s>  - no , sister , i must see her , for i am possibly pressed for time . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the nun did not seem to notice the word  - possibly , -  which gave an obscure and singular meaning to the mayor' s remark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she answered in a low voice ,<s> <s>  - in that case you can go in , sir , though she is asleep . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he made a few remarks about a door that closed badly and whose creaking might awake the patient , then entered fantine' s room , went up to the bed , and opened the curtains . </s> </s>

 - <s> <s> she impetuously interrupted him ,<s> <s>  - but i am well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i tell you i am well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a donkey this doctor is! </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - there , you see , -  the physician said ,  - how violent you are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so long as you are like that , i will prevent your having your child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you grow reasonable , i will bring her myself . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the poor mother hung her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doctor , i ask your pardon; i sincerely ask your pardon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in former times i should not have spoken as i did just now , but i have gone through so much unhappiness that i do not know at times what i am saying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i understand; you are afraid of the excitement; i will wait as long as you like , but i swear to you that it would not do me any harm to see my child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not angry , for i know very well that i am going to be happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole night i have seen white things and smiling faces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor will bring me cosette when he likes; i have no fever now , because i am cured; i feel that there is nothing the matter with me , but i will behave as if i were ill , and not stir , so as to please these ladies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you see that i am quite calm , you will say , we must give her her child . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine had seated himself in a chair by the bed - side; she turned to him , visibly making an effort to appear calm and  - very good , -  as she said in that weakness of illness which resembles childhood , in order that , on seeing her so peaceful , there might be no difficulty in bringing cosette to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , while checking herself , she could not refrain from asking m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine a thousand questions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , how kind it was of you to go and fetch her for me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only tell me how she is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did she stand the journey well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she will not recognize , she will have forgotten me in all this time , poor darling! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> children have no memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had she got clean underclothing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what food did they give her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now it is all passed away and i am happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , how i should like to see her! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can she not be brought here if only for a moment? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could be taken away again directly afterwards . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he took her hand and said:  - cosette is lovely , she is well , you will see her soon; but calm yourself . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> in fact , a fit of coughing interrupted fantine at nearly every word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she did not object; she feared lest she had injured the confidence she had wished to inspire , by some too impassioned entreaties , and she began talking of indifferent matters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in summer , pleasure parties go there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have those thnardiers a good trade? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not many people pass through the village , and theirs is a sort of pot - house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine still held her hand , and was looking at her anxiously; it was evident that he had come to tell her something at which he now hesitated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the physician had left , and sister simplice alone remained near them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a child was playing in the yard , and probably belonged to one of the workmen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was one of those accidents which constantly occur , and seem to form part of the mysterious mise - en - scne of mournful events . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is there in which children' s games are not mingled? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i recognize her voice . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the child went away again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her voice died away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine listened for some time , and then her face was clouded , and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine could hear her murmuring ,  - how unkind that doctor is not to let me see my child! </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> still , her merry ideas returned to her , and she continued to talk to herself , with her head on the pillow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how happy we are going to be! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine has promised me that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my child will play in the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she must know her alphabet by this time , and i will teach her to spell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , she will take her first communion; let me see when that will be . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> she began counting on her fingers ,<s> <s>  - one , two , three , four ,she is now seven years old; in five years , then , she will wear a white open - work veil , and look like a little lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , my good sister , you cannot think how foolish i am , for i am thinking of my daughter' s first communion . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> and she began laughing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had let go fantine' s hand , and listened to these words , as one listens to the soughing breeze , with his eyes fixed on the ground , and his mind plunged into unfathomable reflections . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine had become frightful to look at . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she no longer spoke , she no longer breathed; she was half sitting up , and her thin shoulder projected from her nightgown; her face , radiant a moment previously , was hard , and she seemed to be fixing her eyes , dilated by terror , upon something formidable that stood at the other end of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is what had occurred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> half - past twelve was striking when m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he reached m , and his first care was to post the letter for m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , he had scarce quitted the court ere the public prosecutor , recovering from his stupor , rose on his legs , deplored the act of mania on the part of the honorable mayor of m , declared that his convictions were in no way modified by this strange incident , which would be cleared up at a later date , and demanded , in the interim , the conviction of this champmathieu , evidently the true jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the persistency of the public prosecutor was visibly in contradiction with the feelings of all ,the public , the court , and the jury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine , that is to say , the real jean valjean , circumstances were entirely altered , and the jury had an innocent man before them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the barrister deduced a few arguments , unfortunately rather stale , about judicial errors , etc . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , the president in his summing - up supported the defence , and the jury in a few moments acquitted champmathieu . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> immediately after champmathieu was acquitted , he had a conference with the president as to the necessity of seizing the person of the mayor of m , and after the first emotion had passed , the president raised but few objections . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert was getting up at the moment when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the warrant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the order of arrest , signed by the public prosecutor , was thus conceived:  - inspector javert will apprehend monsieur madeleine , mayor of m , who in this day' s session was recognized as the liberated convict , jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  any one who did not know javert and had seen him at the moment when he entered the infirmary ante - room , could not have guessed what was taking place , but would have considered him to be as usual . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was cold , calm , serious , his gray hair was smoothed down on his temples , and he went up the stairs with his usual slowness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert was a complete character , without a crease in his duty or in his uniform: methodical with criminals , and rigid with his coat - buttons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for him to have his stock out of order , it was necessary for him to be suffering from one of those emotions which might be called internal earthquakes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had merely fetched a corporal and four men from the guardhouse close by , left them in the yard , and had fantine' s room pointed out to him by the unsuspecting portress , who was accustomed to see policemen ask for the mayor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on reaching fantine' s door , javert turned the key , pushed the door with the gentleness either of a sick - nurse or a spy , and entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> correctly speaking , he did not enter: he stood in the half - opened door with his hat on his head , and his left hand thrust into the breast of his great - coat , which was buttoned to the chin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> under his elbow could be seen the leaden knob of his enormous cane , which was concealed behind his back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all at once fantine raised her eyes , saw him , and made m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine turn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no human feeling can succeed in being so horrible as joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the face of a fiend who has just found a condemned soul again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the certainty of at length holding jean valjean caused all he had in his soul to appear on his countenance , and the stirred - up sediment rose to the surface . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the humiliation of having lost the trail for a while and having been mistaken with regard to champmathieu was effaced by his pride at having guessed so correctly at the beginning , and having a right instinct for such a length of time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert' s satisfaction was displayed in his sovereign attitude , and the deformity of triumph was spread over his narrow forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert at this moment was in heaven: without distinctly comprehending the fact , but still with a confused intuition of his necessity and his success , he , javert , personified justice , light , and truth in their celestial function of crushing evil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was in his victory a remnant of defiance and contest: upright , haughty , and dazzling , he displayed the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel in the bright azure of heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the formidable shadow of the deed he was doing rendered visible to his clutching fist the flashing social sword . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> michael . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine had not seen javert since the day when the mayor tore her out of his clutches , and her sickly brain could form no other thought but that he had come to fetch her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could not endure his frightful face: she felt herself dying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she buried her face in her hands , and cried with agony ,<s> <s>  - monsieur madeleine , save me!  - <s> <s> jean valjeanwe will not call him otherwise in futurehad risen , and said to fantine in his gentlest , calmest voice ,<s> <s>  - do not be alarmed: he has not come for you . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> then he turned to javert and said ,<s> <s>  - i know what you want . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> and javert answered ,<s> <s>  - come , make haste - <s> <s> there was something savage and frenzied in the accent that accompanied these words; no orthographer could write it down , for it was no longer human speech , but a roar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not behave as usual , he did not enter into the matter or display his warrant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to him jean valjean was a sort of mysterious combatant , a dark wrestler with whom he had been struggling for five years , and had been unable to throw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this arrest was not a beginning but an end , and he confined himself to saying ,  - come , make haste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  while speaking thus , he did not advance: he merely darted at jean valjean the look which he threw out as a grapple , and with which he violently drew wretches to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was this look which fantine had felt pierce to her marrow two months before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on hearing javert' s roar , fantine opened her eyes again; but the mayor was present , so what had she to fear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one was present but the nun and the mayor; to whom , then , could this humiliating remark be addressed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only to herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she saw an extraordinary thing ,so extraordinary that nothing like it had ever appeared in the darkest delirium of fever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur le maire!  -  fantine screamed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert burst into a laugh ,that frightful laugh which showed all his teeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is no monsieur le maire here . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> jean valjean did not attempt to remove the hand that grasped his collar; he said ,<s> <s>  - javert - <s> <s> javert interrupted him:  - call me monsieur the inspector . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i should like to say a word to you in private , sir , -  jean valjean continued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - speak up , -  javert answered;  - people talk aloud to me . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> jean valjean went on in a low voice ,<s> <s>  - it is a request i have to make of you . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - i tell you to speak up . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - but it must only be heard by yourself - <s> <s>  - what do i care for that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not listening!  - <s> <s> jean valjean turned to him and said rapidly , and in a very low voice ,<s> <s>  - grant me three days ,three days to go and fetch this unhappy woman' s child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will pay whatever you ask , and you can accompany me if you like . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s>  - you must be joking , -  javert cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you ask three days of me that you may bolt! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my child!  -  she exclaimed , - to go and fetch my child? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sister , answer me ,where is cosette? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i want my child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monsieur madeleine , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there' s the other beginning now; will you be quiet , wench? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a devil' s own country , where galley - slaves are magistrates , and street - walkers are nursed like countesses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , well , it will be altered now , and it' s time for it . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he looked fixedly at fantine , and added , as he took a fresh hold of jean valjean' s cravat , shirt , and coat - collar ,<s> <s>  - i tell you there is no m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her head struck against the bed - head , and fell back on her breast with gaping mouth and open eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not here to listen to abuse , so you can save your breath . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> there was in the corner of the room an old iron bedstead in a bad condition , which the sisters used as a sofa when they were sitting up at night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> javert recoiled to the door . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> one thing is certain ,javert trembled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thought of going to fetch the guard , but jean valjean might take advantage of the moment to escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he therefore remained , clutched his stick by the small end , and leaned against the door - post , without taking his eyes off jean valjean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter rested his elbow on the bedstead , and his forehead on his hand , and began contemplating fantine , who lay motionless before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained thus , absorbed and silent , and evidently not thinking of anything else in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on his face and in his attitude there was only an indescribable pity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a few minutes passed in this reverie , he stooped over fantine and spoke to her in a low voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what did he say to her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what could this outcast man say to this dead woman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one on earth heard the words , but did that dead woman hear them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are touching illusions , which are perhaps sublime realities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one thing is indubitable , that sister simplice , the sole witness of what took place , has frequently declared that at the moment when jean valjean whispered in fantine' s ear , she distinctly saw an ineffable smile playing round her pale lips and in her vague eyeballs , which were full of the amazement of the tomb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean took fantine' s head in his hands , and laid it on the pillow , as a mother might have done to a child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when this was done , he closed her eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine' s face at this moment seemed strangely illumined , for death is the entrance into brilliant light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine' s hand was hanging out of bed; jean valjean knelt down by this hand , gently raised and kissed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he rose and turned to javert ,<s> <s>  - now i am at your service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the arrest of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine produced an extraordinary commotion in m , but it is sad to have to say that nearly everybody abandoned him on hearing that he was a galley - slave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in less than two hours all the good he had done was forgotten , and he was only a galley - slave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is but fair to say , though , that they did not yet know the details of the affair at arras . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole day through , conversations like the following could be heard in all parts of the town: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don' t you know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is a liberated convict . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>nonsense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine? yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where to? he will be tried at the assizes for a highway robbery which he formerly committed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he refused the cross , and gave sous to all the little scamps he met . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an old lady , who subscribed to the drapeau blanc , made this remark , whose depth it is almost impossible to fathom ,<s> <s>  - well , i do not feel sorry at it , for it will be a lesson to the buonapartists . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> it is thus that the phantom which called itself m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine faded away at m; only three or four persons in the whole town remained faithful to his memory , and his old servant was one of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the evening of the same day this worthy old woman was sitting in her lodge , still greatly startled and indulging in sad thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine was wont to come in , the worthy portress rose mechanically , took the key of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madeleine' s bed - room from a drawer , and the candlestick which he used at night to go up - stairs; then she hung the key on the nail from which he usually took it , and placed the candlestick by its side , as if she expected him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she sat down again and began thinking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she did not break off her reverie for two or three hours , and then exclaimed:  - only think of that! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have hung his key on the nail!  - <s> <s> at this moment the window of the lodge was opened , a hand was passed through the opening , which seized the key and lit the candle by hers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the portress raised her eyes , and stood with gaping mouth , but she repressed the cry which was in her throat; for she recognized this hand , this arm , this coat - sleeve , as belonging to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was some minutes ere she could speak , for she  - was struck , -  as she said afterwards when describing the adventure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> le maire!  -  she at length exclaimed ,  - i fancied - <s> <s> she stopped , for the end of the sentence would have been disrespectful to the first part . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean was still monsieur le maire with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he completed her thought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that i was in prison?  -  he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was so , but i pulled out a bar , leaped out , and here i am . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am going up to my room; go and fetch sister simplice , who doubtless is by the side of that poor woman . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the old servant hastened to obey; he said nothing further to her , for he was quite sure that she would guard him better than he could himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was never known how he managed to get into the yard without having the gate opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he always carried about him a master - key , which opened a little side door , but he must have been searched and this key taken from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took a glance around him , at his table , his chair , his bed , which had not been slept in for three nights . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no trace of that night' s disorder remained , for the portress  - had done his room; -  but she had picked out of the ashes and laid neatly on the table the two iron ends of the stick and the forty - sous piece , which was blackened by the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took a sheet of paper , on which he wrote ,  - this is the two - franc piece stolen from little gervais to which i alluded in court , -  and he laid the coin on the paper , so that it should be the first thing seen on entering the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took from a drawer an old shirt which he tore up , and wrapped the two candlesticks in the rags . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were two gentle taps at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was sister simplice; she was pale , her eyes were red , and the candle she held shook in her hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the emotions of this day the nun had become a woman again; she had wept and was trembling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jean valjean had just finished writing some lines on a piece of paper , which he handed to the sister , with the remark ,  - sister , you will deliver this to the cur?  - <s> <s> as the paper was open , she turned her eyes on it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may read it , -  he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she read ,  - i request the cur to take charge of all that i leave here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rest will be for the poor . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> the sister attempted to speak , but could only produce a few inarticulate sounds: at length she managed to say ,<s> <s>  - do you not wish to see the poor unhappy girl for the last time , sir?  - <s> <s>  - no , -  he said;  - i am pursued , and if i were to be arrested in her room it would disturb her . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> he had scarce said this , ere a great noise broke out on the staircase: they heard a tumult of ascending steps , and the old servant cry in her loudest and most piercing voice ,<s> <s>  - my good sir , i can take my oath that no one has come in here all day or all the evening , and i have not left my lodge once . </s> </s> 
 - <s> <s> a man answered ,<s> <s>  - but there is a light in that room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the room was so built that the door , on being thrown open , concealed a nook in the right - hand wall: jean valjean blew out the light and crept into the nook . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sister simplice fell on her knees by the table , as the door opened and javert entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the voices of several men and the protestations of the old portress could be heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her candle was on the chimney and gave but little light , and on noticing the nun , javert halted in great confusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it will be remembered that the very basis of javert , his element , the air he breathed , was reverence for all authority: he was all of one piece , and allowed no objection or limitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with him , of course , ecclesiastical authority was the highest of all: he was religious , superficial , and correct on this point as on all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> theirs were souls walled up against the world with only one door , which never opened except to let truth pass out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on noticing the sister , his first movement was to withdraw , but he had another duty too , which imperiously urged him in an opposite direction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sister , -  he asked ,  - are you alone in the room?  - <s> <s> there was a terrible moment , during which the old servant felt as if she were going to faint: the sister raised her eyes and said ,  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i beg your pardon , -  said javert; and he withdrew with a deep bow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , holy woman! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an hour later a man , making his way through the fog , was hurrying away from m in the direction of paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was never known; but a few days before , an old workman had died in the infirmary of the sailors , leaving only a blouse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it might have been that one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one last word about fantine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have all one mother , the earth , and fantine was given back to that mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cur thought he was doing his duty , and perhaps did it , in keeping as much money for the poor as he possibly could out of what jean valjean left him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a convict and a street - walker: hence he simplified fantine' s interment , and reduced it to what is called the  - public grave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> -  fantine was therefore interred in the free corner of the cemetery , which belongs to everybody and to nobody , and where the poor are lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fortunately god knows where to look for a soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fantine was laid in the darkness among a pile of promiscuous bones in the public grave . </s> </s>
