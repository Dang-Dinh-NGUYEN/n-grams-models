 <s> <s> hans went into the stable , cut out all the calves  and sheep s eyes , and threw them in gretel s face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sing me that song again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king and queen had just flown out , so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers , who were lying close together , and every moment she was filled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he got near the battlefield a great part of the king s men had already fallen , and little was wanting to make the rest give way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they might know him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so when frederick and catherine came down , there they found all their money safe and sound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree , and which was full of gold , and lifted it up , grumbling to himself: uncouth people , to cut off a piece of my fine beard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had fallen down again without injury , the giant said: what is this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , when the bird came home and had laid aside his burden , they sat down to table , and when they had finished their meal , they could sleep their fill till the following morning: and that was really a very delightful life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hans had been at home for a long time , but elsie did not come; then said he: what a clever elsie i have; she is so industrious that she does not even come home to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they walked off together towards the spot where chanticleer had seen the light , and as they drew near it became larger and brighter , till they at last came close to a house in which a gang of robbers lived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now they were all beautiful , and all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of sugar , the next some sweet syrup , and the youngest a spoonful of honey; so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he walked nearer than a hundred paces to it , and yet he did not become fixed as before , but found that he could go quite close up to the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and the huntsmen went up to the tree , and when they came back again said , in the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast , such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur , but there it lies fast asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  not knowing what better to do , he came into the plan , and learnt tailoring from the beginning; and when he left his master , he gave him a needle , and said , you can sew anything with this , be it as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when he came to the gate , the guards , who had seen the road he took , said to him , he could not be what he said he was , and must go about his business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep , he got on his legs , and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty , he wanted to go to a well to drink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wilt thou then forget me quite?   but the prince all the time slept so soundly , that her voice only passed over him , and seemed like the whistling of the wind among the fir - trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now go on ,  said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old witch is dead!   then hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  why?   said the king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the prince started at this , and said , let me live , and i will change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my father , and do you give me your shabby one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they began to run , rushed into the parlour , and threw themselves round their father s neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the seed came up , there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and it kept getting larger and larger , and seemed as if it would never cease growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for there never was such a one seen before , and never will again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he listened , and heard an ant - king complain: why cannot folks , with their clumsy beasts , keep off our bodies? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  o , you fool!   said she , then we must all four die of hunger , you may as well plane the planks for our coffins ,  and she left him no peace until he consented . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at night: boy , make me the doublet , and patch the pantaloons , or else i will rap the yard - measure over your ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when therefore he went out , all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money , and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a heavy sum into the bargain , if he would not denounce them , for if he did they would be hanged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he was to have any rest , her husband must once more descend into the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the frog put his head down , and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again , with the ball in his mouth , and threw it on the edge of the spring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he said: oh , you wretched beard - cleaner , you piebald fool , you hungry mouse - hunter , what can you be thinking of? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior , he had one request to make to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received , and they lived for a long time afterwards , happy and contented . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so they had to spend the night with the goose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he fetched other older maps , and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it , but it was many thousand miles away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this time she kept away too long , and stayed beyond the half - hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress , and threw her fur mantle over it , and in her haste did not blacken herself all over with soot , but left one of her fingers white . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you come to the king , and he asks for the beautiful princess , you must say ,  - here she is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he put on her clothes , dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew the curtains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the second came soon afterwards , thinking only of how she might get a feather for herself , but she had scarcely touched her sister than she was held fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will run and fetch someone ,  said rose - red . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she placed the can before her , and turned the tap , and while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle , but looked up at the wall , and after much peering here and there , saw a pick - axe exactly above her , which the masons had accidentally left there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the man was unwilling to do so and said , it may be my youngest daughter , who loves me most , and always runs to meet me when i go home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do i find you here , you old sinner!   said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he was ascending the stairs with them , the gardener met him , and said: how can you take the king s daughter a garland of such common flowers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have done all this only to cure you of your silly pride , and to show you the folly of your ill - treatment of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they came hopping up to it , satisfied their hunger , and cried: we will remember youone good turn deserves another!  <s> <s> and now he had to use his own legs , and when he had walked a long way , he came to a large city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went down again , and as he knew what he had to do , he did it thoroughly , and brought a chest full of gold out with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the princess ran to the door and opened it , and there she saw the frog , whom she had quite forgotten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is rather dark ,  said he; they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the youth heard it , got up , and said: it has not come to that yet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king s daughter , and up she sprang to see what that could be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing was hidden from him , and it seemed as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she took her little lamp , and went into her cabin , and took off the fur skin , and washed the soot from off her face and hands , so that her beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree , he cried out , good morning! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am also the soldier that overset your stall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he went to the judge , and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money , and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to go home: and the king s son said , i shall go and take care of you to your home ; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs fox went up to her room , shut herself in , and her maid , miss cat , sat by the fire , and did the cooking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , go with me , i will see about a place for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they belong to king grisly - beard , hadst thou taken him , they had all been thine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i dare not shoot at him ,  said the huntsman , for i should kill the beautiful young lady also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the man in his terror consented to everything , and when the woman was brought to bed , the enchantress appeared at once , gave the child the name of rapunzel , and took it away with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one summer s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the window; he was in good spirits , and sewed with all his might . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the time was long to him , and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man upstairs waited a short time , but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater , he said: i must go into the cellar myself and see where elsie is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  his mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders , and with it a bottle of sour beer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when this was over the king said , now get ready to goyou must not stay hereyou must travel on with your husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had reached the middle of the forest , the father said: now , children , pile up some wood , and i will light a fire that you may not be cold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  soon afterwards the wolf knocked , and cried: open the door , grandmother , i am little red - cap , and am bringing you some cakes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not even so much as a cow , and still less money to buy one , and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but god helped her , so that she passed safely over them , and then she and the old woman went upstairs , opened the door , and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers  den . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he went up to a neighbouring hill , where a shepherd dwelt , and borrowed his old frock , and thus passed unknown into the town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then as you have spoken to me kindly , and are wise enough to seek for advice , i will tell you how and where to go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so twelve fairies came , each with a high red cap on her head , and red shoes with high heels on her feet , and a long white wand in her hand: and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little princess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the first cock crowed , the manikin carried her back to the royal palace , and laid her in her bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  gretel took the bread under her apron , as hansel had the pebbles in his pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come in , come in!   said she; is not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?   and there was a parlour , and a bedchamber , and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there was a little garden , planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and there was a courtyard behind , full of ducks and chickens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he had but left me one , so that something remained for me to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did not you ask it for anything?   said the wife , we live very wretchedly here , in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  countryman ,  said the witch , who are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it s all gone , and  - what can t be cured must be endured ,  said catherine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is but one pope at a time in christendom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said , as far as the wind blows , and so long as the cock crows , i will journey on , till i find him once again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there ,  cried the sparrow , thou cruel villain , thou hast killed my friend the dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would have been all over with her , likewise , if , by good fortune , a tailor who was travelling in search of work , had not sat down to rest by the brook . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king still would not give him the promised reward , and made a third demand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this beautiful queen fell ill , and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said , promise me that you will never marry again , unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as i am , and who has golden hair like mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last she came to mother holle s house , and as she had heard all about the large teeth from her sister , she was not afraid of them , and engaged herself without delay to the old woman . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades , and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house , and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door , and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club , and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out , throw the rascal up here!   after this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are , i dare say , at this very day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who invited you?   said the little tailor , and drove the unbidden guests away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good day , gretel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely , and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  go home ,  said the fish; she is king already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened that the cat met the fox in a forest , and as she thought to herself: he is clever and full of experience , and much esteemed in the world ,  she spoke to him in a friendly way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the old king was very angry , and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape , and got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea , and where they went to nobody knew and nobody cared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she called all seven to her and said: dear children , i have to go into the forest , be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in , he will devour you allskin , hair , and everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels; but the third , who was called lily , said , dear father , bring me a rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> little marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were still alive , and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the table and ate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  all went off well ,  answered the cat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it , it has lived so well!   you re right ,  said hans , as he weighed it in his hand; but if you talk of fat , my pig is no trifle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the youth wandered on , and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night s lodging . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> poor sultan , who was lying close by them , heard all that the shepherd and his wife said to one another , and was very much frightened to think tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good friend the wolf , who lived in the wood , and told him all his sorrows , and how his master meant to kill him in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she came to the field she said to herself: what shall i do; shall i cut first , or shall i eat first? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes rightall that falls to them is so much gainall their geese are swansall their cards are trumpstoss them which way you will , they will always , like poor puss , alight upon their legs , and only move on so much the faster . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a hungry wolf sprang out , and swallowed up the whole stomach , with tom in it , at one gulp , and ran away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a sight she saw there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the king saw him he fell into a passion , and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young willow - wrens , however , continued to cry and scream , and when their parents again brought food they said: we will not so much as touch one fly s leg , no , not if we were dying of hunger , until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted us!   then the old king said: be easy , he shall be punished ,  and he at once flew with the queen to the bear s cave , and called in: old growler , why have you insulted my children? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the shoemaker heard him , and he jumped up and ran out in his shirt - sleeves , and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts were kept , and washed herself there in a clear stream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this queen died; and the king soon married another wife , who became queen , and was very beautiful , but so vain that she could not bear to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  after hans had gone away , she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  goodbye , hans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day the little man came , and she began with timothy , ichabod , benjamin , jeremiah , and all the names she could remember; but to all and each of them he said , madam , that is not my name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he looked around him , and said , i wish i had something to eat , if not i shall be worse off than before; for here i see neither apples nor pears , nor any kind of fruits , nothing but vegetables . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the boar perceived the tailor , it ran on him with foaming mouth and whetted tusks , and was about to throw him to the ground , but the hero fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at once , and in one bound out again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but just as the wedding was going to be solemnized , old mr fox stirred under the bench , and cudgelled all the rabble , and drove them and mrs fox out of the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he dressed himself as a poor man , and came secretly to the king s court , and was scarcely within the doors when the horse began to eat , and the bird to sing , and the princess left off weeping . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> whither away , hans?   to gretel , mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when hansel and gretel came into her neighbourhood , she laughed with malice , and said mockingly: i have them , they shall not escape me again!   early in the morning before the children were awake , she was already up , and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty , with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: that will be a dainty mouthful!   then she seized hansel with her shrivelled hand , carried him into a little stable , and locked him in behind a grated door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not let him , for fear some harm should come to him: however , at last he consented , and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meantime little heinel grew up , and as the end of the twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond , and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good morning to thee , my friend!   the student looked about everywhere; and seeing no one , and not knowing where the voice came from , cried out , who calls me?  <s> <s> then the man in the tree answered , lift up thine eyes , for behold here i sit in the sack of wisdom; here have i , in a short time , learned great and wondrous things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the woman was satisfied with this; but the king s armour - bearer , who had heard all , was friendly with the young lord , and informed him of the whole plot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she shook the tree , and the apples came falling down upon her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single apple left upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she saw jorindel she was very angry , and screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him , for the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when he began to walk and to move about , the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what do you say of making an exchange?   said the horseman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  good evening , hans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the miller said: what did he say?   the peasant answered: in the first place , he says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the prince thought to himself , i cannot go home to my father without my brothers ; so he said , my dear friend , cannot you tell me where my two brothers are , who set out in search of the water of life before me , and never came back?   i have shut them up by a charm between two mountains ,  said the dwarf , because they were proud and ill - behaved , and scorned to ask advice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the witch fell into a passion , sprang to the window , and as she could look forth quite far into the world , she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her sweetheart roland . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask , which quite hid her from view . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so her little friend took the ring , and began to work at the wheel again , and whistled and sang: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but falada saw it all , and marked it well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> catherine looked , but could not see where it had gone; so she said , well , i suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he has younger legs than i have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after many , many years there came a king s son into that land: and an old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful palace stood behind it , and how a wonderful princess , called briar rose , lay in it asleep , with all her court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as it was midnight , there came in two little naked dwarfs; and they sat themselves upon the shoemaker s bench , took up all the work that was cut out , and began to ply with their little fingers , stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate , that the shoemaker was all wonder , and could not take his eyes off them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they took stock of the hole where the nest lay , and trotted away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he wandered quite blind about the forest , ate nothing but roots and berries , and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well ,  said the grandmother , we will shut the door , that he may not come in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no ,  said the boy , i will not do that; the king has forbidden it ,  and ran away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the witch placed herself on the shore , threw breadcrumbs in , and went to endless trouble to entice the duck; but the duck did not let herself be enticed , and the old woman had to go home at night as she had come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he reached home , he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head , and he resolved to kill his brother . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  goodbye , hans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl , however , when she saw the old woman striding towards her , changed , with her magic wand , her sweetheart roland into a lake , and herself into a duck swimming in the middle of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she went on for a long , long way , till at length she came to the castle whither the princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready , and she heard that the wedding was about to be held . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that you should dig all round my garden for me , tomorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides that , the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways , and laughed at her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom; but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat out of , they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look , do you see that large cauldron of water which i am obliged to keep on the fire! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thereupon the wild man appeared immediately , and said: what do you desire?   i want a strong steed , for i am going to the wars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but tom seemed as if he did not understand them , and bawled out again , how much will you have? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you shall likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion , and ride on a spirited chestnut - horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile , i will run into the cellar , and take a drink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the peasant made the raven croak again , and said: in the second place , he says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you should have stuck the needle in your sleeve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she was twelve years old , the enchantress shut her into a tower , which lay in a forest , and had neither stairs nor door , but quite at the top was a little window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah! </s> </s>

<s> <s> there was great joy at their coming , and the prince flew to meet them , and lifted the maid from her horse , thinking she was the one who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber; but the true princess was told to stay in the court below . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what dangerous walking it is ,  said he , in this ploughed field! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had made two snips , he saw the little red - cap shining , and then he made two snips more , and the little girl sprang out , crying: ah , how frightened i have been! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , what a pretty bird!   said the miser; i would give a great deal of money to have such a one . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> and they stole away out of the palace by night unawares , and seated themselves on the griffin , who flew back with them over the red sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain , when he heard the song of the bird on his roof . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she has a soft , pleasant voice , but your voice is rough; you are the wolf!   then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk , ate this and made his voice soft with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once a merchant who had only one child , a son , that was very young , and barely able to run alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers , and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bless me!   said the old woman , how badly your stays are laced! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they came to the nobleman s castle , the table was spread , and crabb was told to sit down and eat . </s> </s>

<s> <s> swiftly he sprang towards it , and threw a white cloth over it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were all drunk , and paid no heed to her cries and lamentations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before him , and they came into the ante - chamber where the peas were lying , they stepped so firmly on them , and had such a strong , sure walk , that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred . </s> </s>

<s> <s> hans soon came to himself , and got upon his legs again , sadly vexed , and said to the shepherd , this riding is no joke , when a man has the luck to get upon a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break his neck . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when at last they awoke , it was already dark night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> because i am beginning to grow old , and had rather lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice , my mistress laid hold of me , and was going to drown me; and though i have been lucky enough to get away from her , i do not know what i am to live upon . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this evil thought took possession of her more and more , and made her behave very unkindly to the boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ought he to have had such treatment from thee?   then he went out and sent away the company , and said the wedding was at an end , for that he was come back to the kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dear god , do help us ,  she cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor man thought he would try to better himself; so , pulling off his red coat , he became a gardener , and dug his ground well , and sowed turnips . </s> </s>

<s> <s> her waiting - maid said: i will find a cure for him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  very well ,  answered the sparrow , do so , and in the meantime i will perch upon that bush . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  well ,  said the father , we will try for once . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  and in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone; so he went merrily to the king , and told him that now that it was removed he must give him the princess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servant , however , thought he intended by that to say: that is the first thief ,  and as he actually was so , he was terrified , and said to his comrade outside: the doctor knows all: we shall fare ill , he said i was the first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the house - door stood wide open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the little peasant stood at his door , and waited for his little calf , and when the cow - herd drove the cows through the village , and the calf was missing , he inquired where it was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the little kids knew that it was the wolf , by the rough voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it had to go into his pocket with the cheese . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then gretel became angry , tore herself loose and ran away , and was no longer the bride of hans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she made the sister go and sit by the well and spin , and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a thorn - bush , so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then she threw it into the well , and jumped in herself . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  you silly creature!   said the eldest , it is nothing but a nail in the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood - cutter with his wife and his two children . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> as soon as the cook went away , cat - skin heated the king s soup , and toasted a slice of bread first , as nicely as ever she could; and when it was ready , she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring , and put it into the dish in which the soup was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she ran home crying to tell of her misfortune , but her stepmother spoke harshly to her , and after giving her a violent scolding , said unkindly , as you have let the spindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier s mercy , and merely to be allowed to live at all , gave him his kingdom for his own , and his daughter to wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  ah!   said the man , as he gazed upon her , what a fine thing it is to be emperor!   husband ,  said she , why should we stop at being emperor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  hansel , however , stretched out a little bone to her , and the old woman , who had dim eyes , could not see it , and thought it was hansel s finger , and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last the third also came with the like intent , and the others screamed out: keep away; for goodness  sake keep away!   but she did not understand why she was to keep away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next thing she came to was a little house , and there she saw an old woman looking out , with such large teeth , that she was terrified , and turned to run away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you a fellow of that sort?   said he , and could not help admiring his own bravery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was old , however , and had a long white beard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she began to bewail her loss , and said , alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tonight , when the robbers are all asleep , we will flee together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 2 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he gave him the ship which could sail on land and water , and when the king saw that , he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is not enough!   then the uproar began again , there was a roaring and howling , and the other half fell down likewise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  gretel presents hans with a knife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but marleen stood looking on , and wept and wept , and her tears fell into the pot , so that there was no need of salt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again , and he could see with them as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then i will try my skill ,  said the thief , and went and stole her away from under the dragon , so quietly and gently that the beast did not know it , but went on snoring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tomorrow , you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unlucky wretch that i am!   cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was almost all gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she was in a great fright , and cried out to chanticleer , pray run as fast as you can , and fetch me some water , or i shall be choked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why did you not pull the church to pieces , and bring the chandelier home with you?   and now the old cook herself got on her legs , and went with the three servants in pursuit of the children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little tailor went bravely up , spoke to him , and said: good day , comrade , so you are sitting there overlooking the wide - spread world! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day when the feast was again held , and her father , mother , and sisters were gone , ashputtel went to the hazel - tree , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the frog called after her , stay , princess , and take me with you as you said ,  but she did not stop to hear a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no ,  said he , perceiving her evil intention , i will not give you the light until i am standing with both feet upon the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they lived on this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware , and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but a drunken soldier soon came by , and rode his horse against her stall , and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> but she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same tapping at the door; and the frog came once more , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> actually , there were crabs . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> and i ,  said the mother , i feel so uneasy , as if a heavy thunderstorm were coming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she grew impatient , and seeing the ravens flying round the castle , she opened the window , and said: i wish you were a raven and would fly away , then i should have a little peace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and if i had not sewn the boat together again ,  said the tailor , you would all have been drowned , therefore she is mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> luckily a butcher soon came by , driving a pig in a wheelbarrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door is big enough; just look , i can get in myself!   and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then away rattled the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried , bless me , it is hailing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give me a fine fat goose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she cried: snow - white , rose - red , come out , the bear will do you no harm , he means well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , his eyes were sharp and sparkling , and he soon showed himself to be a clever little fellow , who always knew well what he was about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they came to their journey s end , the youngest son brought his cup to the sick king , that he might drink and be healed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the white snow , and said , would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow , as red as that blood , and as black as this ebony windowframe!   and so the little girl really did grow up; her skin was as white as snow , her cheeks as rosy as the blood , and her hair as black as ebony; and she was called snowdrop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray let the fiddle alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  alas!   said the huntsman; the king has ordered me to shoot you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i ought to have something into the bargain ,  said the countryman; give a fat goose for a pig , indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a lovely child she is!   and they were very glad to see her , and took care not to wake her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn , till the night was gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see ,  said she , is not this grand?   with that they went into the castle together , and found a great many servants there , and the rooms all richly furnished , and full of golden chairs and tables; and behind the castle was a garden , and around it was a park half a mile long , full of sheep , and goats , and hares , and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and cow - houses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but her mother said , it is all of no use , you cannot go; you have no clothes , and cannot dance , and you would only put us to shame : and off she went with her two daughters to the ball . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mayor , however , said: but my servant must go first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pretty princess!   thought she , what will now become of thee?   but it happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king s castle , so she said to the cook , may i go up a little while and see what is going on? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the enchantress remarked nothing of this , until once rapunzel said to her: tell me , dame gothel , how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king s sonhe is with me in a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it , and shut the iron door , and fastened the bolt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what wicked tricks are these?   said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that is not done quite as you seem to think ,  said the wolf; you must wait until the queen comes ,  soon afterwards , the queen arrived with some food in her beak , and the lord king came too , and they began to feed their young ones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and just as that was decided on , the young count entered into the church , and suddenly two snow - white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that was ill done , hans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  wife ,  said the fisherman , i don t like to go to him again , for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this pretty cottage to live in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a farmer had a faithful and diligent servant , who had worked hard for him three years , without having been paid any wages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh ,  said he , what long nails you have! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him , and said , listen , my friend , to what i am going to tell you; i will reward you for your kindness; go your way , and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is not the true bride ,  said he to the father; have you no other daughters?   no ,  said he; there is only a little dirty ashputtel here , the child of my first wife; i am sure she cannot be the bride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so they said , well , we cannot say we have not got what we wished for , and , little as he is , we will love him dearly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and this at last angered her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she dressed herself up as a peasant s wife , and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs  cottage , and knocked at the door; but snowdrop put her head out of the window and said , i dare not let anyone in , for the dwarfs have told me not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the cow was killed , and cut up; and the stomach , in which tom lay , was thrown out upon a dunghill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there he sits as easy and happy as if he was at home , in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no stones , saves shoe - leather , and gets on he hardly knows how . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do you desire?   asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the merchant thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely be his dog or his cat , or something of that sort , but forgot his little boy heinel; so he agreed to the bargain , and signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the parson went to the crowd , and declared that the mass had been said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the son sat down on the fox s tail , and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  never mind , will do better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep , and in the morning another apple was gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the little man began to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child , to take home with him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out , now , lady , what is my name?   is it john?   asked she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the children , full of pity , at once took tight hold of the little man , and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , madam!   is it tom?   no , madam!   is it jemmy?   it is not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had brought home the princess to her father , there was great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers , one of you shall marry her , but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when it was at an end , he would have held her fast by the hand , but she slipped away , and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under the stairs . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> while she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after some time he said to her , tomorrow there will be a great feast in your father s house , for your eldest sister is to be married; and if you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the gnat had heard that , she flew away again , and revealed everything , down to the minutest detail , to the willow - wren . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> soon after came up a millstone , an egg , a duck , and a pin; and chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with them . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you slut , you have no clothes , and cannot dance; you shall not go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the fact was , he could not refuse the request , on account of the dwarf s third gift . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of treasure and gold have i enough , and more than anyone in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good day , gretel . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  at last , however , they had pity on him , and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him , the piece of apple fell from between her lips , and snowdrop awoke , and said , where am i?   and the prince said , thou art quite safe with me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> however , the fox bid him be of good cheer , and said , i will help you; lie down there , stretch yourself out quite stiff , and pretend to be dead . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then they went out all day long to their work , seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but snowdrop was left at home; and they warned her , and said , the queen will soon find out where you are , so take care and let no one in . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  the peasant listened , and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this frightened him dreadfully , and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the cock , who had been awakened by the noise , crowed with all his might . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man held his tongue , but heinel said again , what do you want here?   the dwarf said , i come to talk with your father , not with you . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at last the peasant pinched the raven once more till he croaked , and said: fourthly , he says that there are some cakes under the bed . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  now ,  said the grinder , as he gave him a common rough stone that lay by his side , this is a most capital stone; do but work it well enough , and you can make an old nail cut with it . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  thereupon he went away , and when he returned next day she had not done it , and said: why should i shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?   the cook once more said: if you do not do it , it shall cost you your own life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what is it that you are always muttering between your teeth?   ah ,  replied the youth , i do so wish i could shudder , but no one can teach me how . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then the princess came in , and as she passed by them she had something spiteful to say to every one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything went right for a week or two , and then dame ilsabill said , husband , there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; i should like to have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him to give us a castle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have bought this flower at a high price , for i have said i would give you to a wild lion; and when he has you , he will tear you in pieces , and eat you . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as they were now set free , roland said: now i will go to my father and arrange for the wedding . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then she threw the peas down among the ashes , but the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden , and cried out: </s> </s>

<s> <s> i had just driven the wedge safely in , and everything was going as i wished; but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out , and the tree closed so quickly that i could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so now it is tight and i cannot get away , and the silly , sleek , milk - faced things laugh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> heinel said they must first let him try these wonderful things , then he might know how to set a value upon them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  good day , hans , what good thing do you bring?   i bring nothing , but would have something given . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this garden stood a fine large pear - tree full of ripe fruit; and ashputtel , not knowing where to hide herself , jumped up into it without being seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king became very angry at this , and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the king said , that is not true; it was better done than you could do it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was astonished at this and called out: hi! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what an odd thing that is!   said one: there is a cart going along , and i hear a carter talking to the horse , but yet i can see no one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she said to the frog , well , if you will bring me my ball , i will do all you ask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  never mind , will do better next time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was in part due to edgar taylor , who made the first english translation in 1823 , selecting about fifty stories with the amusement of some young friends principally in view . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my tale is done , there runs a mouse; whosoever catches it , may make himself a big fur cap out of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when his request was granted he set out on his way , and one day came to a pond , where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that is queer , indeed ,  said the other; let us follow the cart , and see where it goes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then said the youth , see , little cousin , have i not warmed you?   the dead man , however , got up and cried: now will i strangle you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the faithful maiden heard of this , she grew so sad that she thought her heart would break , and she would not go thither , but the other girls came and took her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  behave well , hans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the robbers , who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert , had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them , and scampered away as fast as they could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wolf ran with the child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but sultan soon overtook him , and carried the poor little thing back to his master and mistress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i don t know how that may be ,  said she; never is a long time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when she had grown up her father said: we will get her married . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> long before the end of the hour the work was quite done , and all flew out again at the windows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the fox managed to tie his legs together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he could not set himself free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was overjoyed to see her , and longed to get to the top of the mountain , but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the chamberlain told him allhow he had given him a sleeping draught , and how a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber , and was to come again that night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two days after there came by a travelling fiddler , who began to play under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him , he said , let him come in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  at length a man came from a distance and wooed her , who was called hans; but he stipulated that clever elsie should be really smart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have been playing at nine - pins ,  he answered , and have lost a couple of farthings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king took the gift very graciously , and said he knew not what to give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so the soldier was forced to put it into a cart , and drag it home with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cloak is very well ,  said he: now give me the sword . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then the prince and briar rose were married , and the wedding feast was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she went on a little farther , till she came to a tree full of apples . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when she began her song , and it reached roland s ears , he sprang up and cried: i know the voice , that is the true bride , i will have no other!   everything he had forgotten , and which had vanished from his mind , had suddenly come home again to his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shake me , shake me , i pray; my apples , one and all , are ripe ,  it cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they brought in a dirty - looking fellow; and when he had sung before the king and the princess , he begged a boon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she took it , and went to her mother s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he carried the child away to a secret place , where a nurse was obliged to suckle it , and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth , and was sure that the servant had betrayed her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meantime the queen went home to her glass , and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before; and she said , snowdrop shall die , if it cost me my life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length the woman hoped that god was about to grant her desire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my golden ball has fallen into the spring . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> hans takes gretel , ties her to a rope , leads her to the rack , and binds her fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the young prince said , all this shall not frighten me; i will go and see this briar rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old woman , however , nodded her head , and said: oh , you dear children , who has brought you here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it , up and down , over thresholds and stairs , but suddenly hop , hop , it turned over upside down , and lay on him like a mountain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have devoured all when you were standing godmother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he gets home , he has the rope in his hand , and there is no longer anything hanging on to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she went on sitting , and hatched them: and in a few days they crawled out , and had only a little red streak across their necks , where the tailor had sewn them together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that s right ,  said he , but go faster . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , do not go!   cried the wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth , when she fell down dead upon the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the miller said: the devil must go out ,  and opened the house - door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys , and the peasant unlocked the closet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my stars!   said she , what shall i do to keep frederick from seeing all this slopping about?   so she thought a while; and at last remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair , and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale nicely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the butcher gave him a flask of ale , saying , there , drink and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don t you see she is an old beast , good for nothing but the slaughter - house?   alas , alas!   said hans , who would have thought it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> early in the morning , before it was quite light , and when nobody was stirring in the inn , chanticleer awakened his wife , and , fetching the egg , they pecked a hole in it , ate it up , and threw the shells into the fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle , who were fast asleep , and seizing them by the heads , stuck one into the landlord s easy chair and the other into his handkerchief; and , having done this , they crept away as softly as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy , and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about , but he went as near as he could to the water s brink , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  wife , wife ,  said the man , why should we wish to be the king? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girls , who by this time were used to his ingratitude , went on their way and did their business in town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was to be done? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at last got? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what noise was that?   said the thief , frightened; i m sure i heard someone speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will take care and stand behind the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he offered the dwarfs money , and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said , we will not part with her for all the gold in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he sent a messenger to the other bride , and entreated her to return to her own kingdom , for he had a wife already , and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he lifted her up , and taking her with him , went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they waited till he was fast asleep , and poured the water of life out of the cup , and took it for themselves , giving him bitter sea - water instead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise , and greeting him , said: give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of your bottle; i am so hungry and thirsty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when he came to the golden road , and his horse had set one foot upon it , he stopped to look at it , and thought it very beautiful , and said to himself , what a pity it is that anything should tread here!   then he too turned aside and rode on the left side of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often went in an evening to take his walk , and ease his mind of a little of his trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good day , gretel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas!   said the mouse , now i see what has happened , now it comes to light! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but ,  replied the husband , the fish cannot make you pope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off the cloak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut the beard , whereby a small part of it was lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he looked up , and said to the second son , at the top of this tree there is a chaffinch s nest; tell me how many eggs there are in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the courtiers heard this they were shocked , and said , heaven forbid that a father should marry his daughter! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he went to the king , and asked for a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the sea , till they came to the right place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree , and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog tied to a rope , and did not know what to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but , as he stooped down to drink , he forgot it , pushed it a little , and down it rolled , plump into the stream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  enough of your foolish chatter ,  said the waggoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower , and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked the flower , and went with it in his hand into the castle , and that everything he touched with it was disenchanted , and that there he found his jorinda again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he went to the innkeeper , who opened his eyes very wide , and said: i never expected to see you alive again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened that as the horse was going a little too fast , and tom was calling out , gently! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , for heaven s sake!   cried the miser , master! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lina saw this and said , listen , old sanna , why are you fetching so much water?   if you will never repeat it to anyone , i will tell you why . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what s the matter?   said the miller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the soldier returned to the town from which he came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  if that s all your grief ,  said the huntsman , i ll take you there with all my heart ; so he drew her under his cloak , and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they were both there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that , too , must be an art of which i understand nothing!  <s> <s> now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: hearken to me , you fellow in the corner there , you are growing tall and strong , and you too must learn something by which you can earn your bread . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> has he nine as beautiful tails as the late mr fox?   oh , no ,  answered the cat , he has only one . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then the gardener s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way , he came to a wood , and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his bow and made ready to shoot at it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in your journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then i will ,  said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day came that had been fixed for the marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the brushwood was lighted , and when the flames were burning very high , the woman said: now , children , lay yourselves down by the fire and rest , we will go into the forest and cut some wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how cold we are!   you fools!   cried he , what are you crying about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen , which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was now three mornings since they had left their father s house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground , and said: if you are strong enough , help me to carry the tree out of the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that was ill done , hans , you should have led the calf , and put it in the stall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they sat at the feast , each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did not say a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner , but he could nowhere see the cook . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the third day things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from him , and he would not have her money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she did not feel that she could trust him , and she could not look at him nor think of him without an inward shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she went by herself into her chamber , and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting , but whoever tasted it was sure to die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not eat , the bird would not sing , and the princess wept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he sat down , and the fox began to run , and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair whistled in the wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unlucky wretch that i am!   said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter , and as she was grown up , he was anxious that she should be well married and provided for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forgive me all the ill i have done you; my mother forced me to it , it was against my will , for i always loved you very much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing better ,  said this false bride , than that she should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails , and that two white horses should be put to it , and should drag it from street to street till she was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are you saying? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i see well enough ,  said the witch , that you can do no more today , but i will keep you yet another night , in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood , and chop it small . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his father and mother came to the wedding , and were in great delight , for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said to him: dear son , i wished to see you once again before my end , promise me to marry as i wish ,  and he named a certain king s daughter who was to be his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he set out once more on his journey , sighing , and in great despair , when on a sudden his friend the fox met him , and said , you see now what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had eaten and drank , and were very merry , the old king said he would tell them a tale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next was too short: what a dumpling!   said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what will you give me ,  said the hobgoblin , to do it for you?   my necklace ,  replied the maiden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not long before they grew quite at home , and played tricks with their clumsy guest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day , as he was roaming along in a brown study , thinking with no great comfort on what he had been and what he now was , and was like to be , all on a sudden there stood before him a little , rough - looking , black dwarf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way , and wanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool , could go no farther , and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water , seized it , and drew it under . </s> </s>

 <s> <s> early in the morning , gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water , and light the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother , and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip , what must his present be worth? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i get hans , and we have a child , and he grows big , and has to draw beer here , the pick - axe will perhaps fall on his head , and kill him . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming , and it seemed as if an evil spirit entered into her , for she snatched the apple out of her little daughter s hand , and said , you shall not have one before your brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  good day , hans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was certainly pleased with this good attendance , but still at last he was so afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went to the king , and told him all his brothers  roguery; and they were seized and punished , and he had the princess given to him again; and after the king s death he was heir to his kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow , and walked over it till she came to the oven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the miller was afraid , and made his paws white for him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you will reach a village in the evening; and when you get there , you will see two inns opposite to each other , one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in there , but rest for the night in the other , though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where did you get the seed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the assembled guests . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in the dark , and the duck seemed much tired , and waddled about a good deal from one side to the other , they made up their minds to fix their quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling , and said his house was full , thinking they might not be very respectable company: however , they spoke civilly to him , and gave him the egg which partlet had laid by the way , and said they would give him the duck , who was in the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in , and they bespoke a handsome supper , and spent the evening very jollily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> long before you or i were born , there reigned , in a country a great way off , a king who had three sons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it so happened that his road one day led through a thick wood , at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow , and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young lady by her side looking about them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he asked his wife for more pudding , and as he ate , he threw the bones under the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the young man agreed to follow his trade , and he soon showed himself so clever , that nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the lion said: they have been informed that they were going to be put to the test , and have assumed some strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he stood at the water s edge , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he can never even get out of the spring to visit me , though he may be able to get my ball for me , and therefore i will tell him he shall have what he asks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went his way , and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people singing , and dancing , and feasting; but the other looked very dirty , and poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> half - done! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go quickly , and get another , and seek out the prettiest and rarest . </s> </s>

<s> <s> red - cap , however , was on her guard , and went straight forward on her way , and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf , and that he had said good morning  to her , but with such a wicked look in his eyes , that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and who has been drinking out of my little glass?  <s> <s> when the seventh came to the bottom of his glass , and found there the ring , he looked at it , and knew that it was his father s and mother s , and said , o that our little sister would but come! </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when they had walked for two hours , they came to a great stretch of water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is my own ring ,  she exclaimed , and if that is so the man must also be here who is coming to set me free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when the princess opened the door the frog came in , and slept upon her pillow as before , till the morning broke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have a brother , who is rich , and your majesty knows him well , and all the world knows him; but because i am poor , everybody forgets me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and they passed on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on reaching the entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes , and these she followed , throwing down some peas on either side of her at every step she took . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the woman said to the servant: just go down into the cellar and see where elsie is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she did so , and the frog hopped into the room , and then straight ontap , tapplash , plashfrom the bottom of the room to the top , till he came up close to the table where the princess sat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what will become of me?   said she; what will my husband say?   so she ran home and told him all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they gave her three kinds of wine to drink , white , red , and yellow , and with that she died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the young man refused to do it: so the fox said , i will at any rate give you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows , and sit down by the side of no river . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the lord had the horses harnessed to his carriage , drove out to the village , and asked crabb if he were doctor knowall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in such and such a house ,  said tom , describing his own father s house . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> with this he went on with his dinner , and said , little marleen , why do you weep? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the youth seized the axe , split the anvil with one blow , and in it caught the old man s beard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mother loved her daughter very much , and when she looked at her and then looked at the boy , it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in the way of her own child , and she was continually thinking how she could get the whole of the property for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when these men heard the tailor speaking thus , they were overcome by a great dread , and ran as if the wild huntsman were behind them , and none of them would venture anything further against him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not conceive how this came to pass , for he never saw a human being in his house , and no one could have concealed himself in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house , and cried out as before: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then came the queen of the bees , who had been saved by the little dwarf from the fire , and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew which was the youngest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two children were so fond of one another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together , and when snow - white said: we will not leave each other ,  rose - red answered: never so long as we live ,  and their mother would add: what one has she must share with the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so away went the fisherman , and found his wife standing before the gate of a great castle . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  so up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth , and was making off with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sausage had only to watch the pot to see that the food was properly cooked , and when it was near dinner - time , he just threw himself into the broth , or rolled in and out among the vegetables three or four times , and there they were , buttered , and salted , and ready to be served . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he went before the king , and he asked him who had cooked the soup . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the first joy at their meeting was over , the princess told him she had heard of his father having forgiven him , and of his wish to have him home again: so , before his wedding with the princess , he went to visit his father , taking her with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now the boy had to plant and water the garden , hoe and dig , and bear the wind and bad weather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if that s the case ,  said the bear , i should very much like to see his royal palace; come , take me thither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when he was riding off with it , the king s attendants pursued him , and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth s leg with the point of his sword . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , they lifted her up , and when they found what ailed her , they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe , and very soon came to life again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a cage on the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little hare would eat a cabbage - leaf out of their hands , the roe grazed by their side , the stag leapt merrily by them , and the birds sat still upon the boughs , and sang whatever they knew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you eat one part , and i will eat the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  very well ,  said she; and they set out: and as frederick walked the fastest , he left his wife some way behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the king called for the princesses , and asked them whether what the soldier said was true: and when they saw that they were discovered , and that it was of no use to deny what had happened , they confessed it all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water , as if it were going to leap in . </s> </s>

<s> <s> prithee , friend , why so sorrowful?   said he to the merchant; what is it you take so deeply to heart?   if you would do me any good i would willingly tell you ,  said the merchant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now she had a golden ball in her hand , which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air , and catching it again as it fell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she rolled the other cheese after it; and away it went , nobody knows where , down the hill . </s> </s>

<s> <s> now they were seven little dwarfs , that lived among the mountains , and dug and searched for gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he will be better off ,  said they , with us than with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but one day as the queen was walking by the side of the river , at the bottom of the garden , she saw a poor little fish , that had thrown itself out of the water , and lay gasping and nearly dead on the bank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here ,  said he to himself , must i find the prize the good fairy told me of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had finished , he flew away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that was ill done , hans , you should have cast friendly eyes on her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then all rode farther on their journey , till the day grew so warm , and the sun so scorching , that the bride began to feel very thirsty again; and at last , when they came to a river , she forgot her maid s rude speech , and said , pray get down , and fetch me some water to drink in my golden cup . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you make me sorry for you; come with me , i will teach you how people get away from the hounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the following day the king s daughter asked the gardener about his boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two hundred deer and more came running inside the circle at once , and the huntsmen shot them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the man saw that he would not get the fifty talers that day , and went away saying: such a youth has never come my way before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give that gold chain , and i will sing it you again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she tried to excuse herself by saying that she would not be able to find the way thither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the barrel began to roll , the shepherd cried: i am quite willing to be mayor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bear said: here , children , knock the snow out of my coat a little ; so they brought the broom and swept the bear s hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly a voice cried: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle , his companion took up his fiddle and played away , and the miser began to dance and spring about , capering higher and higher in the air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where would you like to sit?   said one of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just let twelve spinning - wheels be brought into the ante - chamber , and they will go to them and be pleased with them , and that is what no man would do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after he had walked for a long time , he came to the courtyard of a royal palace , and as he felt weary , he lay down on the grass and fell asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she had gone away , the girl got up and went to her sweetheart , who was called roland , and knocked at his door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he entered the forest he met a little grey - haired old man who bade him good day , and said: do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket , and let me have a draught of your wine; i am so hungry and thirsty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but unseen by the king , the manikin was standing beside him when he said that , and heard all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he told him everything; how his brothers had cheated and robbed him , and yet that he had borne all those wrongs for the love of his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then we should be free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length in her grief she went out , and the youngest kid ran with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one sprang under the table , the second into the bed , the third into the stove , the fourth into the kitchen , the fifth into the cupboard , the sixth under the washing - bowl , and the seventh into the clock - case . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> wife ,  said the man , go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she cut it off , ate it , and enjoyed it , and when she had done , she thought: the other must go down too , or else master will observe that something is missing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had been , still there was not one to be found who had golden hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they came to the meadow , there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he drew near , the raven said , i am by birth a king s daughter , but am now under the spell of some enchantment; you can , however , set me free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the huntsman took up his bow , and at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the king s son soon fell asleep; and when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been dancing , for the soles of their shoes were full of holes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the unicorn ran against the tree with all its strength , and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again , and thus it was caught . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is too bad!   cried he , and sprang up like a madman , and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , yes ,  said the doctor , that is soon managed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there , bird ,  said the shoemaker , now sing me that song again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the second tablet said: the key of the princess s bed - chamber must be fished up out of the lake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the king put in a word , and said , each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady , the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is , there is somebody she likes a great deal better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whilst he slept , there came by a carter with a cart drawn by three horses , and loaded with two casks of wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must just see if she wants anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that s a good joke!   said chanticleer; no , that will never do; i had rather by half walk home; i ll sit on the box and be coachman , if you like , but i ll not draw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the dwarf , who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot , and had not thought that anyone would come there so late . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he drew out his sword and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast , and then went out to the horsemen and said: the work is done; i have finished both of them off , but it was hard work! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they rode back and announced this to the king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the world may very likely not always think of them as they think of themselves , but what care they for the world? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how they did rejoice and embrace each other , and dance about and kiss each other! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but they sat there and did not stir , and the fire caught their clothes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same thing happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be cut off . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when they were all ready , they went and looked at the soldier; but he snored on , and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands , and the bed sank into the floor and a trap - door flew open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there he was to sit and watch where they went to dance; and , in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it , the door of his chamber was left open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his punishment , however , was not delayed; when he had made a few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg , so that he had to be carried home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the fox felt the first string , he started so that he lifted one leg , from pain , but he bore it , and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting , he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third , he could hold out no longer , screamed , and put his tail between his legs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the girl did not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he bought for the first two the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home , as he rode through a green copse , a hazel twig brushed against him , and almost pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he heaped up a great deal of gold , and at last thought to himself , of what use is this gold to me whilst i am at home? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bear would have liked to go at once , but the wolf held him back by the sleeve , and said: no , you must wait until the lord and lady queen have gone away again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and when the baker had rubbed his feet over , he ran to the miller and said: strew some white meal over my feet for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he got up and looked quite kindly at them , but said nothing and went into the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the lord heard that , he cried: there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the queen took pity on the little fish , and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said , i know what your wish is , and it shall be fulfilled , in return for your kindness to meyou will soon have a daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no ,  said the king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wedding was held with great magnificence and small joy , and out of a tailor a king was made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i am contented with anything ,  replied the husband , so far as i am concerned , bread and cheese will do ,  and looked at the peasant and said: come and eat some more with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must first , however , prove whether all you have told me about your three things is true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mother , however , loved the ugly and lazy one best , because she was her own daughter , and so the other , who was only her stepdaughter , was made to do all the work of the house , and was quite the cinderella of the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her , and said , this is the right bride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard , it sentenced him to die , unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind; and if he did this , he was to have the golden bird given him for his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well ,  said she , when one goes another may as well follow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she put on her many - league boots , in which she covered an hour s walk at every step , and it was not long before she overtook them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf , and was going to carry him off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently she came to the apple - tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the soldier consented , and next day laboured with all his strength , but could not finish it by the evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a long while after , he went to walk one day in the wood , and the old fox met him , and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him , and cut off his head and feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is that the royal palace?   cried the bear; it is a wretched palace , and you are not king s children , you are disreputable children!   when the young wrens heard that , they were frightfully angry , and screamed: no , that we are not! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the youth went to the gallows , sat down beneath it , and waited till evening came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a king s son soon came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they gave him plenty of food , yet for all they could do he never grew bigger , but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas!   said he to his wife , what ill luck has befallen me! my wine is all spilt , and my horses all three dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  why , where have you been?   said his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  ah , how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water , and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he led him by dark passages to a smith s forge , took an axe , and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> presently she came to the top of a hill , down the side of which there was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side as they passed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i were to fall from one of these great clods , i should undoubtedly break my neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for , when the mouse had made the fire and fetched in the water , she could retire into her little room and rest until it was time to set the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she ran to the door of her own house , but it was shut; then she knocked at the window and cried: hans , is elsie within?   yes ,  answered hans , she is within . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so when the bride had done drinking , and would have got upon falada again , the maid said , i shall ride upon falada , and you may have my horse instead ; so she was forced to give up her horse , and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her maid s shabby ones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the king made the most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden , like the sun; another silvery , like the moon; and a third sparkling , like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom , and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bridegroom arrived and also a large company of guests , for the miller had taken care to invite all his friends and relations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the cask , for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by the robbers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tom soon set himself to work to get out , which was not a very easy task; but at last , just as he had made room to get his head out , fresh ill - luck befell him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is bringing cake and wine; open the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they turned upon him and tried to seize him; but he drew his sword . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bird now flew to the juniper - tree and began singing: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and when the full moon had risen , hansel took his little sister by the hand , and followed the pebbles which shone like newly - coined silver pieces , and showed them the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , then ,  thought the princess , at last he is gone , and i shall be troubled with him no more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they led him to the spot where the money was concealed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had wandered a long way; and when they looked to see which way they should go home , they found themselves at a loss to know what path to take . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the way he passed by a marsh , in which a number of frogs were sitting croaking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a shame to take my horse , and give me only a dry cow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now do you lie down close by the child , and pretend to be watching it , and i will come out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as you can , and i will let it drop; then you may carry it back , and they will think you have saved their child , and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as long as you live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but they did not know her , and thought it must be some strange princess , she looked so fine and beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of ashputtel , taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will allow you to watch by it once more , but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they walked the whole night long , and by break of day came once more to their father s house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he did not venture to give him his dismissal , for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people dead , and place himself on the royal throne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this touched the old king s heart , and he thought his son might still be guiltless , and said to his court , o that my son were still alive! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not long afterwards , the country was overrun by war . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> thus the princess became a kitchen - maid , and helped the cook to do all the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat that was left , and on this they lived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  not till you have opened the door for me ,  answered the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will soon find out where she is , however ,  said the star - gazer , as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out , i see her afar off , sitting upon a rock in the sea , and i can spy the dragon close by , guarding her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  lord have mercy on us!   cried the father; is that all you have learnt? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; jorindel sat by her side; and both felt sad , they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted from one another for ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that was ill done , hans , you should have put a rope round the goat s neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the glass answered: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , grandmother , what a terrible big mouth you have!  <s> <s> the better to eat you with!  <s> <s> and scarcely had the wolf said this , than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up red - cap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he took up his bow , and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but one of the good qualities which old mr fox had possessed , was always lacking , and the cat had continually to send the suitors away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after this a mist came round the tree , and in the midst of it there was a burning as of fire , and out of the fire there flew a beautiful bird , that rose high into the air , singing magnificently , and when it could no more be seen , the juniper - tree stood there as before , and the silk handkerchief and the bones were gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse , and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her , that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the bird began again: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little tailor , not idle , gathered two pocketsful of stones , and with these climbed up the tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  they came therefore to a decision , betook themselves in a body to the king , and begged for their dismissal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all good things go in threes ,  said she , i am asked to stand godmother again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when all was ready a signal was given , and they began their music . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and the young king was then married to his true wife , and they reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came to see them , and restored the faithful falada to life again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just think ,  said he , when i asked him how he was going to earn his bread , he actually wanted to learn to shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the evening she came to a cottage among the hills , and went in to rest , for her little feet would carry her no further . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his sons were very much grieved at their father s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace , a little old man met them and asked what was the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after all ,  thought he , that chap is pretty well taken in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when he got down , the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously , each out - doing the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i feel as if the whole house were in flames!  <s> <s> but the man went out and looked at the bird . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me hear it too; sing it again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then hans hastened home and brought a fowler s net with little bells and hung it round about her , and she still went on sleeping . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  inside the mill were twenty of the miller s men hewing a stone , and as they went hick hack , hick hack , hick hack ,  the mill went click clack , click clack , click clack . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now take me down!   so his father took hold of the horse with one hand , and with the other took his son out of the horse s ear , and put him down upon a straw , where he sat as merry as you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  in the meantime came the parson; the miller s wife received him well , and said: my husband is out , so we will have a feast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bird ,  he said , how beautifully you sing! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  if that be all ,  replied the sexton , he can learn that with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will be king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in front of the house was a great stone trough , so she said to the child: take the pail , red - cap; i made some sausages yesterday , so carry the water in which i boiled them to the trough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as the girl was assured of this , she came from behind the cask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  with all my heart ,  said the huntsman; i am sure i shall be glad to save you , for i could not have shot you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what did gretel give you?   gave me a needle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had rested himself he set off again , driving his cow towards his mother s village . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was still cursing when a loud growling was heard , and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there they found their child , now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she , however , caught at his cap and pulled it off , and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders , and it was splendid to behold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> goodbye , mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good evening , mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> goodbye , mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when she came in it to the ball , everyone wondered at her beauty: but the king s son , who was waiting for her , took her by the hand , and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to dance , he said as before , this lady is dancing with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  you have thriven well in the world hitherto ,  said the grinder , now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand in it , your fortune would be made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor girl remained there a long time , but at length , as he did not return at all , she was sad , and changed herself into a flower , and thought: someone will surely come this way , and trample me down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she went to the king , and told him the joyful tidings , and when the time was come she gave birth to a son , and the king was filled with gladness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , wife ,  said the fisherman , are you king?   yes ,  said she , i am king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off , laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside , and began to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the peasant , however , made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred talers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boy cried a second time: what do you want here? speak if you are an honest fellow , or i will throw you down the steps!   the sexton thought: he can t mean to be as bad as his words ,  uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first top off , then half - done , then  will you hold your tongue ,  cried the cat , one word more , and i will eat you too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will set it beneath the altar , and not touch it until we are really in need of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> aha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he gave him a lump of silver as big as his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once more the night came on , and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good evening , mother . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> my darling , this is only a dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they asked , too:  - under what hedge have you been lying sleeping all the time? </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> where does your grandmother live , little red - cap?  <s> <s> a good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large oak - trees , the nut - trees are just below; you surely must know it ,  replied little red - cap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and his daughter was also shocked , but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him , before i marry anyone i must have three dresses: one must be of gold , like the sun; another must be of shining silver , like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this , i want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together , to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the king insisted on it , and said: you shall sit by me ,  until he did it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wish you would give them to me ,  said the other; i am very poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone made way for her , for nobody knew her , and they thought she could be no less than a king s daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woodman and his wife , being awakened by the noise , peeped through a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there , you may well suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his axe , and gave his wife a scythe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the eldest said , it is only our princes , who are shouting for joy at our approach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the mother and both the sisters were frightened , and turned pale with anger as he took ashputtel on his horse , and rode away with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but gretel saw what she had in mind , and said: i do not know how i am to do it; how do i get in?   silly goose ,  said the old woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  alas , wife! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went back and said to gretel: be comforted , dear little sister , and sleep in peace , god will not forsake us ,  and he lay down again in his bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as he was cold , he lighted himself a fire , but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire , he could not get warm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but who should come in but the wolf! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice , and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the road led him up a mountain , and when he had reached the highest point of it , there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now the king had a daughter , who was just as beautiful as her mother , and had the same golden hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  many had already made the attempt , but in vain; nevertheless when the youth saw the king s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he forgot all danger , went before the king , and declared himself a suitor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  nonsense!   said the wife; he will do it very willingly , i know; go along and try!  <s> <s> the fisherman went , but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the sea , it looked blue and gloomy , though it was very calm; and he went close to the edge of the waves , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas!   said he , what a clever wife i have! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then rapunzel let down the braids of her hair , and the enchantress climbed up to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wife ,  said the fisherman , as he looked at all this greatness , are you pope?   yes ,  said she , i am pope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she asked if he required any huntsmen , and if he would take all of them into his service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening , but they did not get out of the forest , and were very hungry , for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries , which grew on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage , and below stood the golden cage , and the three golden apples that had been lost were lying close by it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had he known that it was no warlike hero , but a little tailor who was standing before him , it would have gone to his heart still more than it did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the youngest said , i don t know how it is , while you are so happy i feel very uneasy; i am sure some mischance will befall us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  you may smoke three ,  answered the king , but do not imagine that i will spare your life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am as strong as you are , and perhaps even stronger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to have , and said to himself , why should i work hard , and live here on bad fare any longer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces , but grief consumed the king s own heart , and he soon died . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> what has he gone there for , and he never even said goodbye to me!  <s> <s> well , he likes being there , and he told me he should be away quite six weeks; he is well looked after there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he went into the room , and when he came to the bed , he saw that the wolf was lying in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping , he was grieved at heart , and said , she has no doubt been here and driven away again , and it is now too late for me to save her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the sight of this he was overjoyed , and forgetting all about his son , went into trade again , and became a richer merchant than before . </s> </s>

<s> <s> many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go , but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of jorinda . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on the little finger of the murdered girl , and as he could not draw it off easily , he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang into the air , and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was hiding there . </s> </s>

<s> <s> so they dared no longer hide the truth from her , but said it was the will of heaven , and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day , and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease , till at length one day she stole away , and set out into the wide world to find her brothers , wherever they might be , and free them , whatever it might cost her . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  you must have my consent to that first ,  said heinel , so please to step in here , and let us talk it over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  now the little dwarf was getting their dinner ready , and he brought their food upon seven little plates , and their drink in seven little glasses , and set them upon the table , and out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece , and out of each little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had brought with her fall into the last glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whose are these beautiful green meadows?   said she . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  so the cunning thief climbed up the tree , and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird; and it never saw or felt what he was doing , but kept sitting on at its ease . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and it was very lucky for her that she did so , for when she had done the king ordered royal clothes to be put upon her , and gazed on her with wonder , she was so beautiful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she began to cry , and knew not what to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s>

<s> <s> this time the sea looked a dark grey colour , and was overspread with curling waves and the ridges of foam as he cried out: </s> </s>

<s> <s> in the morning when he awoke , he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on the ninth day , early in the morning , he found the beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop , as big as a costly pearl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how happy am i!   cried he; nobody was ever so lucky as i . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wolf greeted her , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then tom thumb , seeing his father , cried out , see , father , here i am with the cart , all right and safe! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the fifth was too red , so she called him coxcomb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  said the peasants: are there any more there?   oh , yes ,  said he , more than i could want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sexton s wife waited a long time for her husband , but he did not come back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed , that she wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely had they set foot on the threshold , when tom called out , don t bring me any more hay!   then the parson himself was frightened; and thinking the cow was surely bewitched , told his man to kill her on the spot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then a soft voice cried from the parlour: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the little girl took the piece of wood , rolled it up in a little cloth , and went on again until she came to the glass - mountain , and found the door shut . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , donkey ,  said chanticleer , what do you see?   what do i see?   replied the ass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so messengers were sent far and wide , to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the huntsman drew off the wolf s skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which red - cap had brought , and revived , but red - cap thought to herself: as long as i live , i will never by myself leave the path , to run into the wood , when my mother has forbidden me to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the duck swam quickly to her , seized her head in its beak and drew her into the water , and there the old witch had to drown . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  you have cheated and taken in my father ,  said the son; pray give him up his bond at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  thereupon he vanished from his sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the whole district was in sorrow and dismay because of them , and yet no one could do anything to stop this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he descended again , and went to his father , and caused himself to be announced as a strange huntsman , and asked if he could offer him service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> influenced by those remarks , the bird next morning refused to bring in the wood , telling the others that he had been their servant long enough , and had been a fool into the bargain , and that it was now time to make a change , and to try some other way of arranging the work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the others laughed , and said: seek one for yourself when we are gone , we will leave one behind us in the stable for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or is it only your good luck? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman , ran up to him , wanted to help him , and drew his glove off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> softly , softly; it can t be done as quickly as that ,  said he , and stood still and waited until the animal was quite close , and then sprang nimbly behind the tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah!   said he , she wants to be lord of the sun and moon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought her so low . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he laid himself down on his bed , and in a little while began to snore very loud as if he was fast asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then cried he: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> frederick slipped down on the other side , and picked up some stones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful house , and the peasants said: the small peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls , and people carry the gold home in shovels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes ,  said he , but come again in half an hour , and cook the king the soup that he likes so much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the truth was , that she had run into her little cabin , pulled off her dress , blackened her face and hands , put on the fur - skin cloak , and was cat - skin again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first tablet said: in the wood , under the moss , lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king s daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun , he who seeks them will be turned into marble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he once more searched the whole palace through , till at last he found a white snake , lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  oho!   she answered , who gives anything to a run - away soldier? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i won t sell him at all ,  said the father; my own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the silver and gold in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so greatly did they desire to have one , that the wife prayed for it day and night , but still they remained childless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when he had gone away , she had a little hind brought to her , and ordered her to be killed , and took her heart and tongue , and laid them on a plate , and when she saw the old man coming , she said to the boy: lie down in your bed , and draw the clothes over you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then poor snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared about her , but none did her any harm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fill your pocket full of peas , and make a small hole in the pocket , and then if you are carried away again , they will fall out and leave a track in the streets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the miller saw the peasant lying on the straw , and asked , what is that fellow doing there?   ah ,  said the wife , the poor knave came in the storm and rain , and begged for shelter , so i gave him a bit of bread and cheese , and showed him where the straw was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  go home , then ,  said the fish; she is in the cottage already!   so the man went home , and saw his wife standing at the door of a nice trim little cottage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother had given her , a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry , a little pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty , and a little stool to rest upon when she should be weary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then i will not have him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here are fifty talers for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you the knight who came every day to the festival , always in different colours , and who caught the three golden apples?   asked the king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said , why did not you listen to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , one day , as they were sitting before the house under a very high tree , the father said , i should like to try what each of you can do in this way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the miller s house was close by , and the miller , you must know , had a very beautiful daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she knew not what to do , and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door , and said , what will you give me to do your task?   the ring on my finger ,  said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he laid himself down , and sleep fell upon him unawares , so that he did not wake up till the clock was striking a quarter to twelve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before you receive my daughter , and the half of my kingdom ,  said he to him , you must perform one more heroic deed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the king s son wished for one , and she immediately stood before him , and was more beautiful than any painter could have painted her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jip!   then up he sprang , and moved off , dragging the lion behind him . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then they tore off her dainty clothing , and cut her beautiful body into pieces and sprinkled salt upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread , and sewed her together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and she kissed him , and said , now you have indeed set me free , and tomorrow we will celebrate our marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last came the little dwarf s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it was so hard to find the pearls , and the job was so tiresome! so he sat down upon a stone and cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  hereupon she was terrified , and said: ah , heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon after this , little marleen came up to her mother who was stirring a pot of boiling water over the fire , and said , mother , brother is sitting by the door with an apple in his hand , and he looks so pale; and when i asked him to give me the apple , he did not answer , and that frightened me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he came out , she said to him: listen , dearest roland , we must fly in all haste; my stepmother wanted to kill me , but has struck her own child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now make the fire , and put on water and cook my supper , for i am very tired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  in the meantime it struck twelve , and the spirit disappeared , so that the youth stood in darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wolf is dead!   and danced for joy round about the well with their mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thought it so beautiful that he got up and ran out , and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , yes , but grete , my wife , must go too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how many arts do you understand?   i understand but one ,  replied the cat , modestly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and on each side of her were two rows of burning lights , of all sizes , the greatest as large as the highest and biggest tower in the world , and the least no larger than a small rushlight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what does the good - for - nothing want in the parlour?   said they; they who would eat bread should first earn it; away with the kitchen - maid!   then they took away her fine clothes , and gave her an old grey frock to put on , and laughed at her , and turned her into the kitchen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whilst he was sitting there , he thought of his dearest mother , and wished that one of the king s principal servants would begin to speak of her , and would ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower , and if she were alive still , or had perished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> snow - white and rose - red kept their mother s little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the judge sent out his officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he was soon caught and brought up to be tried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do that likewise ,  said the giant , if you have strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  how much may it come to?   said the little man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the witch was very angry , and said , such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful thing , and i must and will have it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so they watched the geese till it grew dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she grew up , she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married , she got ready to set off on her journey to his country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elsie why do you weep?   asked the maid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> joy was in every face and every heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the winter , when the earth is frozen hard , they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now , when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth , they break through it , and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands , and in their caves , does not easily see daylight again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what did gretel give you?   gave me a bit of bacon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah!   said the fisherman , she wants to be emperor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse voice: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will not be king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she made a fire on her hearth , and that it might burn the quicker , she lighted it with a handful of straw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  o wife , wife!   said he , how can you be pope? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  no , she is mine ,  said the huntsman; for if i had not killed the dragon , he would , after all , have torn you and the princess into pieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he put his paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white , they believed that all he said was true , and opened the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh ,  said the father , she has plenty of good sense ; and the mother said: oh , she can see the wind coming up the street , and hear the flies coughing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must go outside and see the bird nearer ,  said the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the little girl heard this ( for she stood behind the door all the time and listened ) , she ran forward , and in an instant all the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each other , and went merrily home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he travelled about a long time in search of it and came at last to a dark forest , through which he went on walking for fourteen days and still could not find a way out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now the king felt great joy at this , and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day , and made a great feast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he held on to all the reeds and rushes , but it was of little good , for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish , and was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help crying , for she thought to herself , she should so have liked to have gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went into the house , and was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady s eyes , and doing everything that she wished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am king , it is true; but i begin to be tired of that , and i think i should like to be emperor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the old woman called out , come and eat your suppers , and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won t run away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hansel said to gretel: we shall soon find the way ,  but they did not find it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye , and danced and capered and sprang about , as merry as could be; till at last they danced out at the door , and away over the green . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will see you no more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the queen heard this she jumped for joy , and as soon as her little friend came she sat down upon her throne , and called all her court round to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her arms , as if it was quite ready to be given up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can certainly throw ,  said the giant , but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jacob was a pioneer in the study of german philology , and although wilhelm s work was hampered by poor health the brothers collaborated in the creation of a german dictionary , not completed until a century after their deaths . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where have you been?   with gretel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he came to the house and went inside , the old woman met him , and said , poor man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the horse did as he was told , and the fox went straight to the lion who lived in a cave close by , and said to him , a little way off lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of his carcase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the servant was greatly frightened , and said , it may perhaps be only a cat or a dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering about a few days he luckily found it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that i will ,  said the prince . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure; but still he had not enough: so he took the miller s daughter to a yet larger heap , and said , all this must be spun tonight; and if it is , you shall be my queen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and when he had spoken these words , the old man was changed into a poodle dog , and had a gold collar round his neck , and the cooks were ordered to bring up some live coals , and these he ate , until the flames broke forth from his throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how will you prove that to me?   oh , just let some peas be strewn in the ante - chamber ,  answered the lion , and then you will soon see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you there?   cried the soldier , get to your work at once! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what have i done to deserve this?   thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough ,  said the other; thou art only meeting thy reward : so he played up another tune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the sparrow began to flutter about , and stretch out her neck and cried , carter! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  just keep your noise to yourself ,  said the old woman , it won t help you at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he threw his cloak around him , and passed through the castle hall , and placed himself by the side of the queen , where no one saw him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there , now they will roll better!   said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then said the father: hark you , my son , try as i will i can get nothing into your head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her own child , whose head she had cut off , bathed in her blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he could have a draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then lina said: fundevogel , never leave me , and i will never leave you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now all is over: you have learnt wisdom , and it is time to hold our marriage feast . </s> </s>
