<s> <s> when he got back , his father and mother were rejoiced to see him , and asked him all about it , and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how the boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with autolycus and his sons on mt . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i will tell you all about them , replied eumaeus ,  - laertes is still living and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully in his own house , for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son , and also about the death of his wife , which grieved him greatly and aged him more than anything else did . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he was sacrificial priest to the suitors , and sat in the corner near the mixing - bowl . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  on this they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag , for he was indeed a splendid fellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did he speak , and they did even as he had said . </s> </s>

<s> <s> thus they spoke , for they thought that he had killed antinous by mistake , and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of every one of them . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - but i would not listen to them , and shouted out to him in my rage , cyclops , if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and spoiled your beauty , say it was the valiant warrior ulysses , son of laertes , who lives in ithaca . </s> </s>

<s> <s> cease shooting for the present and leave the matter to the gods , but in the morning let heaven give victory to whom it will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but ulysses glared at them and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his son antiphus had gone with ulysses to ilius , land of noble steeds , but the savage cyclops had killed him when they were all shut up in the cave , and had cooked his last dinner for him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he took the wand with which he seals men s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases , and flew holding it in his hand over pieria; then he swooped down through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea , whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and corner of the ocean , and drenching its thick plumage in the spray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have the suitors returned , or are they still waiting over yonder , to take me on my way home? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she caused their drink to fuddle them , and made them drop their cups from their hands , so that instead of sitting over their wine , they went back into the town to sleep , with their eyes heavy and full of drowsiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go to him , therefore , by sea , and take your own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have a chariot , you can have horses , and here are my sons who can escort you to lacedaemon where menelaus lives . </s> </s>

<s> <s> to this telemachus answered ,  - father , i have always heard of your renown both in the field and in council , but the task you talk of is a very great one: i am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot stand against many and brave ones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she at once set herself to think how she could speed ulysses on his way . </s> </s>

<s> <s> telemachus saw eumaeus long before any one else did , and beckoned him to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he picked it up , brought it to telemachus s table , and sat down opposite him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alcinous , answered ulysses ,  - there is a time for making speeches , and a time for going to bed; nevertheless , since you so desire , i will not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades who did not fall fighting with the trojans , but perished on their return , through the treachery of a wicked woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this he left them to come on at their leisure , while he went quickly forward and soon reached the house of his master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suitors bit their lips as they heard him , and marvelled at the boldness of his speech . </s> </s>

<s> <s> their corn and wine remain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume them , while they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen , sheep , and fat goats for their banquets , and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by and by , however , it seemed as though he was to return safely after all , for the gods backed the wind into its old quarter and they reached home; whereon agamemnon kissed his native soil , and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own country . </s> </s>

<s> <s> they set the battle in array near the ships , and the hosts aimed their bronze - shod spears at one another . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you shall pay for it with your head , and when we have killed you , we will take all you have , in doors or out , and bring it into hotch - pot with ulysses  property; we will not let your sons live in your house , nor your daughters , nor shall your widow continue to live in the city of ithaca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he embraced him , kissed him all over as though he had come back from the dead , and spoke fondly to him saying: </s> </s>

<s> <s> when alcinous heard this he took ulysses by the hand , raised him from the hearth , and bade him take the seat of laodamas , who had been sitting beside him , and was his favourite son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as years went by , there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to ithaca; even then , however , when he was among his own people , his troubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except neptune , who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are dressed differently and your colour is not the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the heifer was brought in from the plain , and telemachus s crew came from the ship; the goldsmith brought the anvil , hammer , and tongs , with which he worked his gold , and minerva herself came to accept the sacrifice . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet voices in lamentcalling and answering one another; there was not an argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot even look him straight in the face . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - they all swore as i bade them , and when they had completed their oath we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh water , and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no one , neither rich nor poor , who is absolutely without any name whatever , for people s fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born . </s> </s>

<s> <s>[61] he went straight through the court , still hidden by the cloak of darkness in which minerva had enveloped him , till he reached arete and king alcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen , and at that moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have heard your father well spoken of; he is nisus of dulichium , a man both brave and wealthy . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the dinner indeed had been prepared amid much merriment; it had been both good and abundant , for they had sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet to come , and nothing can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a brave man were soon to lay before themfor they had brought their doom upon themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow . </s> </s>

<s> <s> my brave comrades were drowned every man of them , but i stuck to the keel and was carried hither and thither for the space of nine days , till at last during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the ogygian island where the great goddess calypso lives . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i could have borne it better even though he were dead , if he had fallen with his men before troy , or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done; for then the achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes , and i should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the storm - winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him , and i inherit nothing but dismay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i want to take it down where the smoke cannot reach it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but even so he did not escape destruction , for minerva had doomed him to fall by the hand of telemachus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which vulcan , with his consummate skill , had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the palace of king alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow old . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - my mother , answered telemachus ,  - tells me i am son to ulysses , but it is a wise child that knows his own father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i told him exactly how everything had happened , and when i said i must go , and asked him to further me on my way , he made no sort of difficulty , but set about doing so at once . </s> </s>

<s> <s> would that i were son to one who had grown old upon his own estates , for , since you ask me , there is no more ill - starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but minerva resolved to help ulysses , so she bound the ways of all the winds except one , and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good stiff breeze from the north that should lay the waters till ulysses reached the land of the phaeacians where he would be safe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus purposely made ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that was paved with stone;[158] he gave him a shabby looking seat at a little table to himself , and had his portion of the inward meats brought to him , with his wine in a gold cup . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> close to her seat stands that of my father , on which he sits and topes like an immortal god . </s> </s>

<s> <s>[75] it is a rugged island , but it breeds brave men , and my eyes know none that they better love to look upon . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when she had done bleeding and was quite dead , they cut her up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one noticed his distress except alcinous , who was sitting near him , and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of course , if death comes to him from the gods , he cannot escape it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - welcome , said he ,  - to our house , and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what you have come for . </s> </s>

<s> <s> add to this more particularly that you are afraid jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine , and that they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and wooing , for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them . </s> </s>

<s> <s> nothing went ill with any of our ships , and we had no sickness on board , but sat where we were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - fear not , nurse , answered telemachus ,  - my scheme is not without heaven s sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this to my mother , till i have been away some ten or twelve days , unless she hears of my having gone , and asks you; for i do not want her to spoil her beauty by crying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me also your country , nation , and city , that our ships may shape their purpose accordingly and take you there . </s> </s>

<s> <s> moreover , he flayed me a prime ox - hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds , which he shut up in the hide as in a sackfor jove had made him captain over the winds , and he could stir or still each one of them according to his own pleasure . </s> </s>

<s> <s> in the meantime i will tell ulysses about your course , and will explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering from misadventure either by land or sea . </s> </s>

<s> <s> telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once , for he was bursting with what he had to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am going to sparta and to pylos to see if i can hear anything about the return of my dear father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear , said he ,  - heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever yet had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , when she had relieved herself by weeping , she turned to him again and said:  - now , stranger , i shall put you to the test and see whether or no you really did entertain my husband and his men , as you say you did . </s> </s>

<s> <s> telemachus answered ,  - antinous , do not chide with me , but , god willing , i will be chief too if i can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your bettersso many of them too? </s> </s>

<s> <s> he put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side - wind could blow from any quarter . </s> </s>

<s> <s> of what family is he , and where is his estate? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> find me a ship , therefore , with a crew of twenty men , and i will lie in wait for him in the straits between ithaca and samos; he will then rue the day that he set out to try and get news of his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is because i have been kept so long in this island , and see no sign of my being able to get away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alcinous , said he ,  - it is not creditable to you that a stranger should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is waiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him , then , to rise and take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver , and bid your servants mix some wine and water that we may make a drink offering to jove the lord of thunder , who takes all well disposed suppliants under his protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper , of whatever there may be in the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these all bit the dust , and as the others drew back into a corner ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he grieves continually about your never having come home , and suffers more and more as he grows older . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then minerva assumed the form and voice of mentor , and presently made a covenant of peace between the two contending parties . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my house grew apace and i became a great man among the cretans , but when jove counselled that terrible expedition , in which so many perished , the people required me and idomeneus to lead their ships to troy , and there was no way out of it , for they insisted on our doing so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am full of heaviness , but i ought not to sit weeping and wailing in another person s house , nor is it well to be thus grieving continually . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as he spoke he went on board , and bade the others do so also and loose the hawsers , so they took their places in the ship . </s> </s>

<s> <s> in the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with the cups of guests who had been feasting with my father , as being in attendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public assembly , so she snatched up three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress , while i followed her , for i knew no better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then penelope said ,  - nurse ,[147] i hate every single one of them , for they mean nothing but mischief , but i hate antinous like the darkness of death itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would have nothing to do with other people , but led the life of an outlaw . </s> </s> 
[62]<s> <s> then ulysses said:  - pray , alcinous , do not take any such notion into your head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not so much care , however , about my parents now , though i should dearly like to see them again in my own country; it is the loss of ulysses that grieves me most; i cannot speak of him without reverence though he is here no longer , for he was very fond of me , and took such care of me that wherever he may be i shall always honour his memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as regards your questions , however , i will not prevaricate nor deceive you , but will tell you without concealment all that the old man of the sea told me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for my own end it was in this wise: heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house , nor was i attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear people out and kill them , but my longing to know what you were doing and the force of my affection for youthis it was that was the death of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now when the child of morning rosy - fingered dawn appeared , nestor left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble that stood in front of his house . </s> </s>

<s> <s> nevertheless there was still much trouble in store for me , for at this point neptune would let me go no further , and raised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that i could no longer keep to my raft , which went to pieces under the fury of the gale , and i had to swim for it , till wind and current brought me to your shores . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pick out , therefore , the three best men you have in your fleet , and i will tell you all the tricks that the old man will play you . </s> </s>

<s> <s> here my father has a field of rich garden ground , about as far from the town as a man s voice will carry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has he got wind of some host approaching , and does he wish to warn us , or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was descended from melampus , who used to live in pylos , the land of sheep; he was rich and owned a great house , but he was driven into exile by the great and powerful king neleus . </s> </s>

<s> <s> nestor s son pisistratus at once offered his hand to each of them , and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were lying on the sands near his father and his brother thrasymedes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a third mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put golden cups upon the tables , while the fourth brought in water and set it to boil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i often grieve , as i sit here in my house , for one and all of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no ulysses to ward off harm from our doors , and i cannot hold my own against them . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - eurymachus , answered ulysses ,  - if you and i were to work one against the other in early summer when the days are at their longestgive me a good scythe , and take another yourself , and let us see which will last the longer or mow the stronger , from dawn till dark when the mowing grass is about . </s> </s>

<s> <s> thereon minerva began to tell them of the many sufferings of ulysses , for she pitied him away there in the house of the nymph calypso . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus heard him , and at once went up to his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eurymachus then came up and said ,  - queen penelope , daughter of icarius , if all the achaeans in iasian argos could see you at this moment , you would have still more suitors in your house by tomorrow morning , for you are the most admirable woman in the whole world both as regards personal beauty and strength of understanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he took his seat again on the seat from which he had risen; and antinous rebuked him saying: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gods have given me quite enough worries without that , for i have lost the best of masters , and am in continual grief on his account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , though he be dead as you think he is , yet by apollo s will he has left a son behind him , telemachus , who will note anything done amiss by the maids in the house , for he is now no longer in his boyhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , as one who lives alone in the country , far from any neighbor , hides a brand as fire - seed in the ashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere , even so did ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and minerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes , closed his eyelids , and made him lose all memories of his sorrows . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i am even more anxious about him than about my husband; i am all in a tremble when i think of him , lest something should happen to him , either from the people among whom he has gone , or by sea , for he has many enemies who are plotting against him , and are bent on killing him before he can return home . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - so she swore at once as i had told her , and when she had completed her oath then i went to bed with her . </s> </s>

<s> <s> tell me , o muse , of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of troy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by and by the women returned from the fountain , and the swineherd came after them with the three best pigs he could pick out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses scowled at her and answered ,  - my good woman , why should you be so angry with me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters , take the women into the space between the domed room and the wall of the outer court , and run them through with your swords till they are quite dead , and have forgotten all about love and the way in which they used to lie in secret with the suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this never leaves it , so that the top is never clear not even in summer and early autumn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a fellow like this never won a prize for anything in his life , but will go about rubbing his shoulders against every man s door post , and begging , not for swords and cauldrons[144] like a man , but only for a few scraps not worth begging for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for myself , heaven has given me a life of such unmeasurable woe , that even by day when i am attending to my duties and looking after the servants , i am still weeping and lamenting during the whole time; then , when night comes , and we all of us go to bed , i lie awake thinking , and my heart becomes a prey to the most incessant and cruel tortures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man knows neither ache nor pain if he gets hit while fighting for his money , or for his sheep or his cattle; and even so antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable belly , which is always getting people into trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but who is to go with you and light you to the store - room? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you have got past the gates and through the outer court , go right across the inner court till you come to my mother . </s> </s>

<s> <s> there are many ships in ithaca both old and new; i will run my eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get her ready and will put out to sea without delay . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - meanwhile lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had been killing his cows , whereon he flew into a great rage , and said to the immortals , father jove , and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss , i must have vengeance on the crew of ulysses  ship: they have had the insolence to kill my cows , which were the one thing i loved to look upon , whether i was going up heaven or down again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so we stayed sobbing and sighing where we were till morning came . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when i had prayed sufficiently to the dead , i cut the throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench , whereon the ghosts came trooping up from erebusbrides ,[89] young bachelors , old men worn out with toil , maids who had been crossed in love , and brave men who had been killed in battle , with their armour still smirched with blood; they came from every quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when ulysses  son comes home again he will give you both cloak and shirt , and send you wherever you may want to go . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then he would begin trying to push it up hill again , and the sweat ran off him and the steam rose after him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did he speak , and his words pleased them well , so they rose forthwith and went to the house of ulysses , where they took their accustomed seats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have never yet been near the achaean land nor set foot on my native country , and i have had nothing but one long series of misfortunes from the very first day that i set out with agamemnon for ilius , the land of noble steeds , to fight the trojans . </s> </s> 
[125]<s> <s>  - but why , said ulysses ,  - did you not tell him , for you knew all about it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then i told the rest to go on board at once , lest any of them should taste of the lotus and leave off wanting to get home , so they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - then i took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; i also took my bow , and told eurylochus to come back with me and shew me the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would be monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when now the year had come in the courses of the seasons , wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home to ithaca , not even there was he quit of labours , not even among his own; but all the gods had pity on him save poseidon , who raged continually against godlike odysseus , till he came to his own country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - amphimedon , it said ,  - what has happened to all you fine young menall of an age toothat you are come down here under the ground? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> antiphates became father of oicleus , and oicleus of amphiaraus , who was dearly loved both by jove and by apollo , but he did not live to old age , for he was killed in thebes by reason of a woman s gifts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses searched the whole court carefully over , to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living , but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in their blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as for me i live out of the way here with the pigs , and never go to the town unless when penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news about ulysses . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i made a drink - offering to all the dead , first with honey and milk , then with wine , and thirdly with water , and i sprinkled white barley meal over the whole , praying earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts , and promising them that when i got back to ithaca i would sacrifice a barren heifer for them , the best i had , and would load the pyre with good things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two maid servants were sleeping near her , both very pretty , one on either side of the doorway , which was closed with well made folding doors . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i wish father jove , minerva , and apollo would break the neck of every one of these wooers of yours , some inside the house and some out; and i wish they might all be as limp as irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then jove s daughter helen bethought her of another matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , when they had feasted their eyes upon him sufficiently , they washed their hands and began to cook him for dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he at once said ,  - aldermen and town councillors of the phaeacians , we have had enough now , both of the feast , and of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports , so that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers , wrestlers , jumpers , and runners . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that day did they travel , swaying the yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the land . </s> </s>

[157]<s> <s> then telemachus went out of the court to the place where the achaeans were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand , and he was not alone , for his two dogs went with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was plain that some one of the gods was helping them , for they fell upon us with might and main throughout the cloisters , and there was a hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in , and the ground seethed with our blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did he speak , and they went on board even as he had said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently the sun set and darkness was over all the land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here they unharnessed the mules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the water side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you say he perished in the cause of king agamemnon; tell me who he was , in case i may have met with such a person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - happy ulysses , son of laertes , replied the ghost of agamemnon ,  - you are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare excellence of understanding , and so faithful to her wedded lord as penelope the daughter of icarius . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here the graces bathed her , and anointed her with oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of , and they clothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noemon then went back to his father s house , but antinous and eurymachus were very angry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then nurse euryclea said ,  - my child , what are you talking about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should like my future husband to be just such another as he is , if he would only stay here and not want to go away . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i got fond of him and cherished him , and had set my heart on making him immortal , so that he should never grow old all his days; still i cannot cross jove , nor bring his counsels to nothing; therefore , if he insists upon it , let the man go beyond the seas again; but i cannot send him anywhere myself for i have neither ships nor men who can take him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wife , said he , turning to queen arete ,  - go , fetch the best chest we have , and put a clean cloak and shirt in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything was enveloped in spray; there were no harbours where a ship might ride , nor shelter of any kind , but only headlands , low - lying rocks , and mountain tops . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his daughter it is that holds the hapless man in sorrow: and ever with soft and guileful tales she is wooing him to forgetfulness of ithaca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stood in the middle of the assembly and the good herald pisenor brought him his staff . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had done dinner they threw off the veils that covered their heads and began to play at ball , while nausicaa sang for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it discomfits their enemies , makes the hearts of their friends glad , and they themselves know more about it than any one . </s> </s>

<s> <s> presently she said ,  - telemachus , you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have taken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and how he came by his end; so go straight up to nestor that we may see what he has got to tell us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - meanwhile menelaus and i were on our way home from troy , on good terms with one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this you answered , o swineherd eumaeus ,  - old man , you will neither get paid for bringing good news , nor will ulysses ever come home; drink your wine in peace , and let us talk about something else . </s> </s>
