<s> <s> at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , replied elizabeth;  - but it is not in my power to accept it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself . </s> </s>

{346}<s> <s>  - do you really think so? </s> </s>

<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , awkward and solemn ,{115} apologizing instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give . </s> </s>

<s> <s> darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how is half such a sum to be repaid? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your tempers are by no means unlike . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness . </s> </s>

<s> <s> wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter , especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her . </s> </s>

{58}<s> <s>  - and so ended his affection , said elizabeth , impatiently . </s> </s>

{132}<s> <s> he next day opened a new scene at longbourn . </s> </s> 
{348}<s> <s>  - but you see that jane , said her aunt ,  - does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her father lifted up his eyes , jane was distressed , elizabeth looked expressively at lydia; but she , who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued ,<s> <s>  - oh , mamma , do the people hereabouts know i am married to - day? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not qualified to form one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her brother s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable . </s> </s>

{32}<s> <s>  - you are severe on us . </s> </s>

<s> <s> their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute inquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he begged pardon for having displeased her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: i thought it would never be over; for , by the bye , you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it not so , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , cried miss bingley ,  - charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill - will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is such a spur to one s genius , such an opening for wit , to have a dislike of that kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after; the very shoe - roses for netherfield were got by proxy . </s> </s>

<s> <s> let her go , then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma am? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted , his air gloomy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley returned mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am astonished , my dear , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins had promised; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s long speeches would allow , everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried elizabeth;  - but how could that be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> both sisters were uncomfortable enough . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - undoubtedly , replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed ,  - there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in an{114} instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted , for mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they will have nothing else to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have{213}<s> <s>  - the gentlemen accompanied him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not think it is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we acted with the best intentions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dearest lizzy ,{336} i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know them a little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can it be really so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is very hard to think that she might have been mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the old lady is mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first place , the book ( it may be barely necessary to remind the reader ) was in its first shape written very early , somewhere about 1796 , when miss austen was barely twenty - one; though it was revised and finished at chawton some fifteen years later , and was not published till 1813 , only four years before her death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present{379} arrangement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing further to wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began; but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is there of good to be expected? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his manners are very different from his cousin s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you supposed more than really existed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , replied elizabeth ,  - there are such people , but i hope i am not one of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my mind , however , is now made up on the subject; for , having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cannot know what mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal , regard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a little time , thereforei shall certainly try to get the better<s> <s> with a stronger voice she soon added ,  - i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> very little was said by either; kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and , perhaps , he might be doing the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she grew absolutely ashamed of herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her sister made not the smallest objection , and the pianoforte was opened; and darcy , after a few moments  recollection , was not sorry for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , though unknown . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see what you are feeling , replied charlotte;  - you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that , if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for , though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday . </s> </s>

<s> <s> if cynicism means the perception of  - the other side , the sense of  - the accepted hells beneath , the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed , and that to seem is not identical with to beif this be cynicism , then every man and woman who is not a fool , who does not care to live in a fool s paradise , who has knowledge of nature and the world and life , is a cynic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy himself; but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , may be guessed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she followed her father to the fireplace , and they both sat down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i always said it must be so , at last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she answered him with cold civility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after sitting for a moment in silence , she said , very stiffly , to elizabeth ,<s> <s>  - i hope you are well , miss bennet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was humbled , she was grieved; she repented , though she hardly knew of what . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one must speak a little , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages , and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill - used . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but so they always are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were , in fact , very fine ladies; not deficient in good - humour when they were pleased , nor in the power{20} of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley were at piquet , and mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy was condemned as the worst of men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i knew you would be wishing me joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , to be sure , was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary . </s> </s> 
{243}<s> <s> lizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes . </s> </s>

<s> <s> his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days  time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment , now quartered in the north . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they may wish many things besides his happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , the gardener s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet give up the point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to me this humour seems to possess a greater affinity , on the whole , to that of addison than to any other of the numerous species of this great british genus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane was beyond competition her favourite child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the situation of your mother s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father:pardon me ,it pains me to offend you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , very different; but i think mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> forster , said she ,  - it will be quite shocking to send her away! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door - bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to inquire particularly after her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that , if left wholly to himself , jane s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her; and the good - natured wishes for her well - doing , which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such a husband her misery was considered certain . </s> </s>

<s> <s> we had better not mention it . </s> </s>

<s> <s> that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his character sunk on every review of it; and , as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . </s> </s>

<s> <s> these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in{273} visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a salad and cucumber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the former were many good paintings: but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane was not happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth; and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as for your elizabeth s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte , stationed himself so{218} as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance . </s> </s>

<s> <s> in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see , every day , that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld , by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow - creatures , if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wiser to resist? </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could perhaps believe , that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the period of expectation was now doubled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you observed it , mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tumult of her mind was now painfully great . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my reasons for believing it are briefly these:it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable . </s> </s>

<s> <s> to make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the term miniature in its restricted sense , and must think rather of memling at one end of the history of painting and meissonier at the other , than of cosway or any of his kind . </s> </s>

{53}<s> <s> lizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she did not fear her father s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means; that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in{462} disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth; and , as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you certainly do , she replied with a smile;  - but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their{229} third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife , or when putting mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh . </s> </s>

<s> <s> they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - to be sure , lizzy , said her aunt ,  - he is not so handsome as wickham; or rather he has not wickham s countenance , for his features are perfectly good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> although miss austen always liked something of the misunderstanding kind , which afforded her opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to be noticed presently , she has been satisfied here with the perfectly natural occasions provided by the false account of darcy s conduct given by wickham , and by the awkwardness ( arising with equal naturalness ) from the gradual transformation of elizabeth s own feelings from positive aversion to actual love . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but , amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and , more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over; and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in tones of such mortifying , yet merited , reproach , her sense of shame was severe . </s> </s>

<s> <s> poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , in short , was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals . </s> </s>

<s> <s> there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant , who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she performed her part , indeed , without much graciousness , but mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them; by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she mentioned this to her friend , miss lucas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was then disclosed in the following manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to{395} the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have a sweet room here , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lady catherine , i have nothing further to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning ,  - that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away , tried to join , with her usual cheerfulness , in the general conversation: but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental{326} meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am trying to make it out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , it must be my uncle s doings! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , sat for some time without speaking to anybody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she does not touch what she did not feel herself called to paint; i am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not feel herself called to touch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nobody wants him to come; though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and , if i was her , i would not have put up with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham only shook his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dearest jane! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed like wilful ill - nature , or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence; and , at last , on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what was your mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but with miss austen the myriad , trivial , unforced strokes build up the picture like magic . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have not been used to submit to any person s whims . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are a very strange creature by way of a friend! always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in lydia s imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what relates to yourself is as follows:having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir; but i do not know when that will be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is very strange . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , you must send a servant with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard; and i remained convinced , from the evening s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he arranges the business just as he pleases . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . </s> </s>

<s> <s> to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate , and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister further . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i cannot see why mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she answered in the affirmative; and , unable to resist the temptation , added ,  - when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy about it , if you had rather not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively , sportive manner of talking to her brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but there were{247} other causes of repugnance; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but when questioned by him , denny denied knowing anything of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but upon my honour i do not . </s> </s>

{327}<s> <s> onvinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with{328} how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bennet , cried his wife ,  - what are you talking of? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; where else can they be so well concealed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this accounted to elizabeth for mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could have added ,  - a young man , too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - if you were aware , said elizabeth ,  - of the very great{288} disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner , nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham , indeed , had gone to her on their first arrival in london; and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have not the smallest hope . </s> </s>

<s> <s> jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out , like his information . </s> </s>

<s> <s> while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise ,{343} all astonishment , that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible . </s> </s>

<s> <s> her character will be fixed; and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man , and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a thousand things may arise in six months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? </s> </s>

<s> <s> my temper i dare not vouch for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when she read and re - read , with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate . </s> </s>

<s> <s> if , therefore , she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because , if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much; and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . </s> </s>

<s> <s> what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other , and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i knew how it would bei knew he would manage everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind: charlotte tried to console her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did not wink at you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , really , replied elizabeth;  - i think there cannot be too little said on the subject . </s> </s>

<s> <s> wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on george wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was melancholy to leave her to such society! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality , no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it had come with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked , he meant to make inquiries at clapham . </s> </s>

<s> <s> elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he was too happy , however , to need much attention; and ,{166} luckily for the others , the business of love - making relieved them from a great deal of his company . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied kitty ,  - it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i suppose you have heard of it; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july ,{298} and must be in london again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour; and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing in even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of pemberley . </s> </s> 
{41}<s> <s> she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged; jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was agreed to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , eliza , said charlotte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am thinking of what you have been telling me , said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to art , if she has never tried idealism , her realism is real to a degree which makes the false realism of our own day look merely dead - alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i have wounded your sister s feelings , it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added ,  - unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson:that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is a sweet - tempered , amiable , charming man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this , mary very gravely replied ,  - far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he now wished it more than ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he drew a chair near her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . </s> </s> 
{279}<s> <s>  - indeed , replied elizabeth ,  - i am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern; and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to - morrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued ,<s> <s>  - my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and , thirdly , which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he heard her attentively , and then said ,<s> <s>  - lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - miss bennet , replied her ladyship , in an angry tone ,  - you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to pemberley , therefore , they were to go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he readily agreed to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed , at his desire , to the other side of the fireplace , that she might be farther from the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such an openness and gentleness in his manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> james s had made him courteous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there can be no doubt of that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> next to being married , a girl likes to{174} be crossed in love a little now and then . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she opened the door , and met maria in the landing - place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out ,<s> <s>  - in conversation with the ladies<s> <s>  - oh , my dear eliza! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes , she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of{451} feelings which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , said her ladyship ,  - you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was dated from rosings , at eight o clock in the morning , and was as follows: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how was that possible? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley and jane? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend; and , in the evening , elizabeth joined their party in the drawing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{134} you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - undoubtedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his{339}<s> <s>  - i have not an instant to lose<s> <s> concern , and observe her in compassionate silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had only to say in reply , that{458} they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i speak feelingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are you telling miss bennet? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a fortnight since mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , feeling really anxious , determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman , walking was her only alternative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but , if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has not an ill - natured look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you did! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy was punctual in his return , and , as lydia informed you , attended the wedding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ,with less of splendour , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins allowed him to speak , replied with an air of distant civility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive anything extraordinary in them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the story which followed , of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , my dear lydia , i don t at all like your going such a way off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine; and under that apprehension was putting{222} away her half - finished letter , that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - if it was to be a secret , said jane ,  - say not another word on the subject . </s> </s>

<s> <s> though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house ,{64} and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did she call to refuse her consent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is the place to get husbands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - your list of the common extent of accomplishments , said darcy ,  - has too much truth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could think of nothing else; and yet , whether bingley s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends  interference; whether he had been aware of jane s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet said only ,  - nonsense , nonsense! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is , indeed , the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend . </s> </s>

<s> <s> darcy is impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it is unlucky , said she , after a short pause ,  - that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberleyfor she had reached it only to a late breakfastought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning . </s> </s>
