<s> <s> these men wanted dogs , and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs , with strong muscles by which to toil , and furry coats to protect them from the frost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> judge miller s place , it was called . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it stood back from the road , half hidden among the trees , through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide - spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were great stables , where a dozen grooms and boys held forth , rows of vine - clad servants  cottages , an endless and orderly array of outhouses , long grape arbors , green pastures , orchards , and berry patches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and over this great demesne buck ruled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here he was born , and here he had lived the four years of his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was true , there were other dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there could not but be other dogs on so vast a place , but they did not count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they came and went , resided in the populous kennels , or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of toots , the japanese pug , or ysabel , the mexican hairless ,strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the other hand , there were the fox terriers , a score of them at least , who yelped fearful promises at toots and ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but buck was neither house - dog nor kennel - dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his father , elmo , a huge st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bernard , had been the judge s inseparable companion , and buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless , one hundred and forty pounds , to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect , enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself , was even a trifle egotistical , as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house - dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him , as to the cold - tubbing races , the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and this was the manner of dog buck was in the fall of 1897 , when the klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen north . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but buck did not read the newspapers , and he did not know that manuel , one of the gardener s helpers , was an undesirable acquaintance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> manuel had one besetting sin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he loved to play chinese lottery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> also , in his gambling , he had one besetting weaknessfaith in a system; and this made his damnation certain . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the judge was at a meeting of the raisin growers  association , and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club , on the memorable night of manuel s treachery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one saw him and buck go off through the orchard on what buck imagined was merely a stroll . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and with the exception of a solitary man , no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as college park . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you might wrap up the goods before you deliver  m , the stranger said gruffly , and manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around buck s neck under the collar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to be sure , it was an unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew , and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger s hands , he growled menacingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had merely intimated his displeasure , in his pride believing that to intimate was to command . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in quick rage he sprang at the man , who met him halfway , grappled him close by the throat , and with a deft twist threw him over on his back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but his strength ebbed , his eyes glazed , and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next he knew , he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he opened his eyes , and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnapped king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man sprang for his throat , but buck was too quick for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his jaws closed on the hand , nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i m takin   m up for the boss to  frisco . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> concerning that night s ride , the man spoke most eloquently for himself , in a little shed back of a saloon on the san francisco water front . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all i get is fifty for it , he grumbled;  - an  i wouldn t do it over for a thousand , cold cash . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how much did the other mug get? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the saloon - keeper demanded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a hundred , was the reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here , lend me a hand before you pull your freight , he added . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dazed , suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue , with the life half throttled out of him , buck attempted to face his tormentors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he was thrown down and choked repeatedly , till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there he lay for the remainder of the weary night , nursing his wrath and wounded pride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not understand what it all meant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what did they want with him , these strange men? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not know why , but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open , expecting to see the judge , or the boys at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the saloon - keeper let him alone , and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> more tormentors , buck decided , for they were evil - looking creatures , ragged and unkempt; and he stormed and raged at them through the bars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he , and the crate in which he was imprisoned , began a passage through many hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> clerks in the express office took charge of him; he was carted about in another wagon; a truck carried him , with an assortment of boxes and parcels , upon a ferry steamer; he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot , and finally he was deposited in an express car . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights buck neither ate nor drank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls , and they had retaliated by teasing him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he flung himself against the bars , quivering and frothing , they laughed at him and taunted him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they growled and barked like detestable dogs , mewed , and flapped their arms and crowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was all very silly , he knew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity , and his anger waxed and waxed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not mind the hunger so much , but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever - pitch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for that matter , high - strung and finely sensitive , the ill treatment had flung him into a fever , which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they would never get another rope around his neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon that he was resolved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for two days and nights he neither ate nor drank , and during those two days and nights of torment , he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his eyes turned blood - shot , and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so changed was he that the judge himself would not have recognized him; and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at seattle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small , high - walled back yard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a stout man , with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck , came out and signed the book for the driver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that was the man , buck divined , the next tormentor , and he hurled himself savagely against the bars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man smiled grimly , and brought a hatchet and a club . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you ain t going to take him out now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the driver asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in , and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck rushed at the splintering wood , sinking his teeth into it , surging and wrestling with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wherever the hatchet fell on the outside , he was there on the inside , snarling and growling , as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , you red - eyed devil , he said , when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of buck s body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and buck was truly a red - eyed devil , as he drew himself together for the spring , hair bristling , mouth foaming , a mad glitter in his blood - shot eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he whirled over , fetching the ground on his back and side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had never been struck by a club in his life , and did not understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a dozen times he charged , and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity , he again hurled himself at the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the man , shifting the club from right to left , coolly caught him by the under jaw , at the same time wrenching downward and backward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck described a complete circle in the air , and half of another , then crashed to the ground on his head and chest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long , and buck crumpled up and went down , knocked utterly senseless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s no slouch at dog - breakin  , that s wot i say , one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he lay where he had fallen , and from there he watched the man in the red sweater . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - answers to the name of buck ,  the man soliloquized , quoting from the saloon - keeper s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , buck , my boy , he went on in a genial voice ,  - we ve had our little ruction , and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you ve learned your place , and i know mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be a good dog and all  ll go well and the goose hang high . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be a bad dog , and i ll whale the stuffin  outa you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> understand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded , and though buck s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand , he endured it without protest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the man brought him water he drank eagerly , and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat , chunk by chunk , from the man s hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was beaten ( he knew that ); but he was not broken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw , once for all , that he stood no chance against a man with a club . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that club was a revelation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was his introduction to the reign of primitive law , and he met the introduction halfway . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the facts of life took on a fiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed , he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the days went by , other dogs came , in crates and at the ends of ropes , some docilely , and some raging and roaring as he had come; and , one and all , he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> also he saw one dog , that would neither conciliate nor obey , finally killed in the struggle for mastery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now and again men came , strangers , who talked excitedly , wheedlingly , and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck wondered where they went , for they never came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him , and he was glad each time when he was not selected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet his time came , in the end , in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken english and many strange and uncouth exclamations which buck could not understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sacredam! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dat one dam bully dog! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how moch? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - three hundred , and a present at that , was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> considering that the price of dogs had been boomed skyward by the unwonted demand , it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the canadian government would be no loser , nor would its despatches travel the slower . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perrault knew dogs , and when he looked at buck he knew that he was one in a thousand - one in ten t ousand , he commented mentally . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck saw money pass between them , and was not surprised when curly , a good - natured newfoundland , and he were led away by the little weazened man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater , and as curly and he looked at receding seattle from the deck of the narwhal , it was the last he saw of the warm southland . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> curly and he were taken below by perrault and turned over to a black - faced giant called franois . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perrault was a french - canadian , and swarthy; but franois was a french - canadian half - breed , and twice as swarthy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were a new kind of men to buck ( of which he was destined to see many more ) , and while he developed no affection for them , he none the less grew honestly to respect them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he speedily learned that perrault and franois were fair men , calm and impartial in administering justice , and too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the  tween - decks of the narwhal , buck and curly joined two other dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as buck sprang to punish him , the lash of franois s whip sang through the air , reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained to buck but to recover the bone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller , and though one day was very like another , it was apparent to buck that the weather was steadily growing colder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last , one morning , the propeller was quiet , and the narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois leashed them and brought them on deck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the first step upon the cold surface , buck s feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> more of this white stuff was falling through the air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he tried it again , with the same result . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the onlookers laughed uproariously , and he felt ashamed , he knew not why , for it was his first snow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck s first day on the dyea beach was like a nightmare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every hour was filled with shock and surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no lazy , sun - kissed life was this , with nothing to do but loaf and be bored . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here was neither peace , nor rest , nor a moment s safety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all was confusion and action , and every moment life and limb were in peril . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and men were not town dogs and men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought , and his first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> curly was the victim . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were camped near the log store , where she , in her friendly way , made advances to a husky dog the size of a full - grown wolf , though not half so large as she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no warning , only a leap in like a flash , a metallic clip of teeth , a leap out equally swift , and curly s face was ripped open from eye to jaw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the wolf manner of fighting , to strike and leap away; but there was more to it than this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck did not comprehend that silent intentness , nor the eager way with which they were licking their chops . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> curly rushed her antagonist , who struck again and leaped aside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she never regained them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was what the onlooking huskies had waited for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they closed in upon her , snarling and yelping , and she was buried , screaming with agony , beneath the bristling mass of bodies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so sudden was it , and so unexpected , that buck was taken aback . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw franois , swinging an axe , spring into the mess of dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it did not take long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two minutes from the time curly went down , the last of her assailants were clubbed off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody , trampled snow , almost literally torn to pieces , the swart half - breed standing over her and cursing horribly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the scene often came back to buck to trouble him in his sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , he would see to it that he never went down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again , and from that moment buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of curly , he received another shock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois fastened upon him an arrangement of straps and buckles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a harness , such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois was stern , demanding instant obedience , and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience; while dave , who was an experienced wheeler , nipped buck s hind quarters whenever he was in error . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spitz was the leader , likewise experienced , and while he could not always get at buck , he growled sharp reproof now and again , or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck into the way he should go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck learned easily , and under the combined tuition of his two mates and franois made remarkable progress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ere they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at  - ho , to go ahead at  - mush , to swing wide on the bends , and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dat buck , heem pool lak hell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by afternoon , perrault , who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his despatches , returned with two more dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - billee and  - joe he called them , two brothers , and true huskies both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sons of the one mother though they were , they were as different as day and night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> billee s one fault was his excessive good nature , while joe was the very opposite , sour and introspective , with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck received them in comradely fashion , dave ignored them , while spitz proceeded to thrash first one and then the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> billee wagged his tail appeasingly , turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail , and cried ( still appeasingly ) when spitz s sharp teeth scored his flank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but no matter how spitz circled , joe whirled around on his heels to face him , mane bristling , ears laid back , lips writhing and snarling , jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap , and eyes diabolically gleamingthe incarnation of belligerent fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so terrible was his appearance that spitz was forced to forego disciplining him; but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing billee and drove him to the confines of the camp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by evening perrault secured another dog , an old husky , long and lean and gaunt , with a battle - scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was called sol - leks , which means the angry one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like dave , he asked nothing , gave nothing , expected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst , even spitz left him alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had one peculiarity which buck was unlucky enough to discover . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of this offence buck was unwittingly guilty , and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when sol - leks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forever after buck avoided his blind side , and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tent , illumined by a candle , glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he , as a matter of course , entered it , both perrault and franois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils , till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep , but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miserable and disconsolate , he wandered about among the many tents , only to find that one place was as cold as another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> finally an idea came to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to his astonishment , they had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again he wandered about through the great camp , looking for them , and again he returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> were they in the tent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then where could they possibly be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with drooping tail and shivering body , very forlorn indeed , he aimlessly circled the tent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> something wriggled under his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but a friendly little yelp reassured him , and he went back to investigate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he whined placatingly , squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions , and even ventured , as a bribe for peace , to lick buck s face with his warm wet tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another lesson . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so that was the way they did it , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck confidently selected a spot , and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at first he did not know where he was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the snow walls pressed him on every side , and a great surge of fear swept through himthe fear of the wild thing for the trap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog , an unduly civilized dog , and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ere he landed on his feet , he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a shout from franois hailed his appearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wot i say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dog - driver cried to perrault . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dat buck for sure learn queek as anyt ing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perrault nodded gravely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as courier for the canadian government , bearing important despatches , he was anxious to secure the best dogs , and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still more surprising was the change wrought in dave and sol - leks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being , and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dave was wheeler or sled dog , pulling in front of him was buck , then came sol - leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead , single file , to the leader , which position was filled by spitz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck had been purposely placed between dave and sol - leks so that he might receive instruction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> apt scholar that he was , they were equally apt teachers , never allowing him to linger long in error , and enforcing their teaching with their sharp teeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dave was fair and very wise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as franois s whip backed him up , buck found it to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once , during a brief halt , when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start , both dave and sol - leks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the resulting tangle was even worse , but buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done , so well had he mastered his work , his mates about ceased nagging him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois s whip snapped less frequently , and perrault even honored buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a hard day s run , up the caon , through sheep camp , past the scales and the timber line , across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep , and over the great chilcoot divide , which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely north . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes , and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of lake bennett , where thousands of goldseekers were building boats against the break - up of the ice in the spring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just , but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that day they made forty miles , the trail being packed; but the next day , and for many days to follow , they broke their own trail , worked harder , and made poorer time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as a rule , perrault travelled ahead of the team , packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perrault was in a hurry , and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice , which knowledge was indispensable , for the fall ice was very thin , and where there was swift water , there was no ice at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> always , they broke camp in the dark , and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck was ravenous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet the other dogs , because they weighed less and were born to the life , received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to remedy this , he ate as fast as they; and , so greatly did hunger compel him , he was not above taking what did not belong to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he watched and learned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he saw pike , one of the new dogs , a clever malingerer and thief , slyly steal a slice of bacon when perrault s back was turned , he duplicated the performance the following day , getting away with the whole chunk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a great uproar was raised , but he was unsuspected; while dub , an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught , was punished for buck s misdeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this first theft marked buck as fit to survive in the hostile northland environment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it marked his adaptability , his capacity to adjust himself to changing conditions , the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was fit , that was all , and unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all his days , no matter what the odds , he had never run from a fight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> civilized , he could have died for a moral consideration , say the defence of judge miller s riding - whip; but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his development ( or retrogression ) was rapid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his muscles became hard as iron , and he grew callous to all ordinary pain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could eat anything , no matter how loathsome or indigestible; and , once eaten , the juices of his stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body , building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sight and scent became remarkably keen , while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes; and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole , he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night in advance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the domesticated generations fell from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed , to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they quickened the old life within him , and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they came to him without effort or discovery , as though they had been his always . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when , on the still cold nights , he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and wolflike , it was his ancestors , dead and dust , pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , as token of what a puppet thing life is , the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the north , and because manuel was a gardener s helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dominant primordial beast was strong in buck , and under the fierce conditions of trail life it grew and grew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet it was a secret growth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease , and not only did he not pick fights , but he avoided them whenever possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a certain deliberateness characterized his attitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the other hand , possibly because he divined in buck a dangerous rival , spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp on the shore of lake le barge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> driving snow , a wind that cut like a white - hot knife , and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they could hardly have fared worse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at their backs rose a perpendicular wall of rock , and perrault and franois were compelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tent they had discarded at dyea in order to travel light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so snug and warm was it , that he was loath to leave it when franois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when buck finished his ration and returned , he found his nest occupied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a warning snarl told him that the trespasser was spitz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the beast in him roared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a - a - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried to buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gif it to heem , by gar! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gif it to heem , the dirty t eef! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spitz was equally willing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck was no less eager , and no less cautious , as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an oath from perrault , the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame , and a shrill yelp of pain , heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perrault found one with head buried in the grub - box . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs , and the grub - box was capsized on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the instant a score of the famished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the clubs fell upon them unheeded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the meantime the astonished team - dogs had burst out of their nests only to be set upon by the fierce invaders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never had buck seen such dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were mere skeletons , draped loosely in draggled hides , with blazing eyes and slavered fangs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the hunger - madness made them terrifying , irresistible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no opposing them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the team - dogs were swept back against the cliff at the first onset . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck was beset by three huskies , and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the din was frightful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> billee was crying as usual . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> joe was snapping like a demon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once , his teeth closed on the fore leg of a husky , and he crunched down through the bone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pike , the malingerer , leaped upon the crippled animal , breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk , buck got a frothing adversary by the throat , and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them , and buck shook himself free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub , upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> billee , terrified into bravery , sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the ice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pike and dub followed on his heels , with the rest of the team behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he braced himself to the shock of spitz s charge , then joined the flight out on the lake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> later , the nine team - dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though unpursued , they were in a sorry plight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was not one who was not wounded in four or five places , while some were wounded grievously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dub was badly injured in a hind leg; dolly , the last husky added to the team at dyea , had a badly torn throat; joe had lost an eye; while billee , the good - natured , with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons , cried and whimpered throughout the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at daybreak they limped warily back to camp , to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fully half their grub supply was gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had eaten a pair of perrault s moose - hide moccasins , chunks out of the leather traces , and even two feet of lash from the end of franois s whip . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mebbe all mad dog , sacredam! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the courier shook his head dubiously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with four hundred miles of trail still between him and dawson , he could ill afford to have madness break out among his dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape , and the wound - stiffened team was under way , struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered , and for that matter , the hardest between them and dawson . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thirty mile river was wide open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty terrible miles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and terrible they were , for every foot of them was accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but a cold snap was on , the thermometer registering fifty below zero , and each time he broke through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing daunted him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen for government courier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took all manner of risks , resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the usual fire was necessary to save them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but behind him was dave , likewise straining backward , and behind the sled was franois , pulling till his tendons cracked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again , the rim ice broke away before and behind , and there was no escape except up the cliff . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perrault scaled it by a miracle , while franois prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope , the dogs were hoisted , one by one , to the cliff crest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois came up last , after the sled and load . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then came the search for a place to descend , which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope , and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day s credit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the time they made the hootalinqua and good ice , buck was played out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first day they covered thirty - five miles to the big salmon; the next day thirty - five more to the little salmon; the third day forty miles , which brought them well up toward the five fingers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck s feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave - dweller or river man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all day long he limped in agony , and camp once made , lay down like a dead dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hungry as he was , he would not move to receive his ration of fish , which franois had to bring to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was a great relief , and buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning , when franois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his back , his four feet waving appealingly in the air , and refused to budge without them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the pelly one morning , as they were harnessing up , dolly , who had never been conspicuous for anything , went suddenly mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she announced her condition by a long , heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear , then sprang straight for buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he plunged through the wooded breast of the island , flew down to the lower end , crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island , gained a third island , curved back to the main river , and in desperation started to cross it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and all the time , though he did not look , he could hear her snarling just one leap behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back , still one leap ahead , gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that franois would save him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck staggered over against the sled , exhausted , sobbing for breath , helpless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sprang upon buck , and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then franois s lash descended , and buck had the satisfaction of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the teams . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dat buck two devils , was franois s rejoinder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all de tam i watch dat buck i know for sure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spitz , as lead - dog and acknowledged master of the team , felt his supremacy threatened by this strange southland dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and strange buck was to him , for of the many southland dogs he had known , not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were all too soft , dying under the toil , the frost , and starvation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck was the exception . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was preeminently cunning , and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck wanted it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wanted it because it was his nature , because he had been gripped tight by that nameless , incomprehensible pride of the trail and tracethat pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp , which lures them to die joyfully in the harness , and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was the pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the sled - dogs who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness - up time in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he did it deliberately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one night there was a heavy snowfall , and in the morning pike , the malingerer , did not appear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois called him and sought him in vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spitz was wild with wrath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he raged through the camp , smelling and digging in every likely place , snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his hiding - place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when he was at last unearthed , and spitz flew at him to punish him , buck flew , with equal rage , in between . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so unexpected was it , and so shrewdly managed , that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pike , who had been trembling abjectly , took heart at this open mutiny , and sprang upon his overthrown leader . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck , to whom fair play was a forgotten code , likewise sprang upon spitz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this failed to drive buck from his prostrate rival , and the butt of the whip was brought into play . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the days that followed , as dawson grew closer and closer , buck still continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits; but he did it craftily , when franois was not around , with the covert mutiny of buck , a general insubordination sprang up and increased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dave and sol - leks were unaffected , but the rest of the team went from bad to worse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> trouble was always afoot , and at the bottom of it was buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here were many men , and countless dogs , and buck found them all at work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all day they swung up and down the main street in long teams , and in the night their jingling bells still went by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here and there buck met southland dogs , but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead , or the stars leaping in the frost dance , and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow , this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life , only it was pitched in minor key , with long - drawn wailings and half - sobs , and was more the pleading of life , the articulate travail of existence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was an old song , old as the breed itselfone of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations , this plaint by which buck was so strangely stirred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seven days from the time they pulled into dawson , they dropped down the steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trail , and pulled for dyea and salt water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> several things favored him in this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the week s rest had recuperated the dogs and put them in thorough trim . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they made sixty mile , which is a fifty - mile run , on the first day; and the second day saw them booming up the yukon well on their way to pelly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and vexation on the part of franois . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the insidious revolt led by buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no more was spitz a leader greatly to be feared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old awe departed , and they grew equal to challenging his authority . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pike robbed him of half a fish one night , and gulped it down under the protection of buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another night dub and joe fought spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and even billee , the good - natured , was less good - natured , and whined not half so placatingly as in former days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck never came near spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact , his conduct approached that of a bully , and he was given to swaggering up and down before spitz s very nose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they quarrelled and bickered more than ever among themselves , till at times the camp was a howling bedlam . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dave and sol - leks alone were unaltered , though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his lash was always singing among the dogs , but it was of small avail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> directly his back was turned they were at it again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he backed up spitz with his whip , while buck backed up the remainder of the team . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois knew he was behind all the trouble , and buck knew he knew; but buck was too clever ever again to be caught red - handed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he worked faithfully in the harness , for the toil had become a delight to him; yet it was a greater delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the mouth of the tahkeena , one night after supper , dub turned up a snowshoe rabbit , blundered it , and missed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a second the whole team was in full cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a hundred yards away was a camp of the northwest police , with fifty dogs , huskies all , who joined the chase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rabbit sped down the river , turned off into a small creek , up the frozen bed of which it held steadily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it ran lightly on the surface of the snow , while the dogs ploughed through by main strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck led the pack , sixty strong , around bend after bend , but he could not gain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and leap by leap , like some pale frost wraith , the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets , the blood lust , the joy to killall this was buck s , only it was infinitely more intimate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and such is the paradox of living , this ecstasy comes when one is most alive , and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this ecstasy , this forgetfulness of living , comes to the artist , caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the soldier , war - mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it came to buck , leading the pack , sounding the old wolf - cry , straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was sounding the deeps of his nature , and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he , going back into the womb of time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was mastered by the sheer surging of life , the tidal wave of being , the perfect joy of each separate muscle , joint , and sinew in that it was everything that was not death , that it was aglow and rampant , expressing itself in movement , flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but spitz , cold and calculating even in his supreme moods , left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck did not know of this , and as he rounded the bend , the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him , he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at sound of this , the cry of life plunging down from life s apex in the grip of death , the full pack at buck s heels raised a hell s chorus of delight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck did not cry out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they rolled over and over in the powdery snow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a flash buck knew it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the time had come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was to the death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they circled about , snarling , ears laid back , keenly watchful for the advantage , the scene came to buck with a sense of familiarity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he seemed to remember it all ,the white woods , and earth , and moonlight , and the thrill of battle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was not the faintest whisper of airnothing moved , not a leaf quivered , the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit , these dogs that were ill - tamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to buck it was nothing new or strange , this scene of old time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was as though it had always been , the wonted way of things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spitz was a practised fighter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from spitzbergen through the arctic , and across canada and the barrens , he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bitter rage was his , but never blind rage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in passion to rend and destroy , he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first defended that attack . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in vain buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang clashed fang , and lips were cut and bleeding , but buck could not penetrate his enemy s guard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he warmed up and enveloped spitz in a whirlwind of rushes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> time and time again he tried for the snow - white throat , where life bubbled near to the surface , and each time and every time spitz slashed him and got away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then buck took to rushing , as though for the throat , when , suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side , he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of spitz , as a ram by which to overthrow him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spitz was untouched , while buck was streaming with blood and panting hard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fight was growing desperate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as buck grew winded , spitz took to rushing , and he kept him staggering for footing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once buck went over , and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up; but he recovered himself , almost in mid air , and the circle sank down again and waited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but buck possessed a quality that made for greatnessimagination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fought by instinct , but he could fight by head as well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he rushed , as though attempting the old shoulder trick , but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his teeth closed on spitz s left fore leg . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thrice he tried to knock him over , then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> despite the pain and helplessness , spitz struggled madly to keep up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw the silent circle , with gleaming eyes , lolling tongues , and silvery breaths drifting upward , closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only this time he was the one who was beaten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no hope for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck was inexorable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he manuvred for the final rush . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a pause seemed to fall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every animal was motionless as though turned to stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then buck sprang in and out; but while he was in , shoulder had at last squarely met shoulder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dark circle became a dot on the moon - flooded snow as spitz disappeared from view . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck stood and looked on , the successful champion , the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found it good . </s> </s>

<s> <s> buck trotted up to the place spitz would have occupied as leader; but franois , not noticing him , brought sol - leks to the coveted position . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the old dog did not like it , and showed plainly that he was afraid of buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , by gar , i feex you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried , coming back with a heavy club in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the driver went about his work , and he called to buck when he was ready to put him in his old place in front of dave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck retreated two or three steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after some time of this , franois threw down the club , thinking that buck feared a thrashing . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he wanted , not to escape a clubbing , but to have the leadership . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had earned it , and he would not be content with less . </s> </s>

<s> <s> they threw clubs at him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they cursed him , and his fathers and mothers before him , and all his seed to come after him down to the remotest generation , and every hair on his body and drop of blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of their reach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not try to run away , but retreated around and around the camp , advertising plainly that when his desire was met , he would come in and be good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perrault looked at his watch and swore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> time was flying , and they should have been on the trail an hour gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then franois went up to where sol - leks stood and called to buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck laughed , as dogs laugh , yet kept his distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the team stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line , ready for the trail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no place for buck save at the front . </s> </s>

<s> <s> franois complied , whereupon buck trotted in , laughing triumphantly , and swung around into position at the head of the team . </s> </s>

<s> <s> highly as the dog - driver had forevalued buck , with his two devils , he found , while the day was yet young , that he had undervalued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at a bound buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required , and quick thinking and quick acting , he showed himself the superior even of spitz , of whom franois had never seen an equal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it , that buck excelled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dave and sol - leks did not mind the change in leadership . </s> </s>

<s> <s> so long as that were not interfered with , they did not care what happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> billee , the good - natured , could lead for all they cared , so long as he kept order . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rest of the team , however , had grown unruly during the last days of spitz , and their surprise was great now that buck proceeded to lick them into shape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pike , who pulled at buck s heels , and who never put an ounce more of his weight against the breast - band than he was compelled to do , was swiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was done he was pulling more than ever before in his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first night in camp , joe , the sour one , was punished roundlya thing that spitz had never succeeded in doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior weight , and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for mercy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the general tone of the team picked up immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it recovered its old - time solidarity , and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the traces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the rink rapids two native huskies , teek and koona , were added; and the celerity with which buck broke them in took away franois s breath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nevaire such a dog as dat buck! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , nevaire! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> heem worth one t ousan  dollair , by gar! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wot you say , perrault? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and perrault nodded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was ahead of the record then , and gaining day by day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the trail was in excellent condition , well packed and hard , and there was no new - fallen snow with which to contend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in one run they made a sixty - mile dash from the foot of lake le barge to the white horse rapids . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> across marsh , tagish , and bennett ( seventy miles of lakes ) , they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run towed behind the sled at the end of a rope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and on the last night of the second week they topped white pass and dropped down the sea slope with the lights of skaguay and of the shipping at their feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty miles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois called buck to him , threw his arms around him , wept over him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like other men , they passed out of buck s life for good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a scotch half - breed took charge of him and his mates , and in company with a dozen other dog - teams he started back over the weary trail to dawson . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck did not like it , but he bore up well to the work , taking pride in it after the manner of dave and sol - leks , and seeing that his mates , whether they prided in it or not , did their fair share . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a monotonous life , operating with machine - like regularity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at a certain time each morning the cooks turned out , fires were built , and breakfast was eaten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , while some broke camp , others harnessed the dogs , and they were under way an hour or so before the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at night , camp was made . </s> </s>

<s> <s> there were fierce fighters among them , but three battles with the fiercest brought buck to mastery , so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got out of his way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes he thought of judge miller s big house in the sun - kissed santa clara valley , and of the cement swimming - tank , and ysabel , the mexican hairless , and toots , the japanese pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater , the death of curly , the great fight with spitz , and the good things he had eaten or would like to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was not homesick . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sunland was very dim and distant , and such memories had no power over him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he uttered strange sounds , and seemed very much afraid of the darkness , into which he peered continually , clutching in his hand , which hung midway between knee and foot , a stick with a heavy stone made fast to the end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was all but naked , a ragged and fire - scorched skin hanging part way down his back , but on his body there was much hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not stand erect , but with trunk inclined forward from the hips , on legs that bent at the knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about his body there was a peculiar springiness , or resiliency , almost catlike , and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and unseen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between his legs and slept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on such occasions his elbows were on his knees , his hands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whereupon the other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes , and he would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a hard trip , with the mail behind them , and the heavy work wore them down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dogs were tired , the drivers grumbling , and to make matters worse , it snowed every day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this meant a soft trail , greater friction on the runners , and heavier pulling for the dogs; yet the drivers were fair through it all , and did their best for the animals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they ate before the drivers ate , and no man sought his sleeping - robe till he had seen to the feet of the dogs he drove . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , their strength went down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since the beginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles , dragging sleds the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life of the toughest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck stood it , keeping his mates up to their work and maintaining discipline , though he , too , was very tired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was dave who suffered most of all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> something had gone wrong with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once out of the harness and down , he did not get on his feet again till harness - up time in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes , in the traces , when jerked by a sudden stoppage of the sled , or by straining to start it , he would cry out with pain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the driver examined him , but could find nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the drivers became interested in his case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they talked it over at meal - time , and over their last pipes before going to bed , and one night they held a consultation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> something was wrong inside , but they could locate no broken bones , could not make it out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the time cassiar bar was reached , he was so weak that he was falling repeatedly in the traces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his intention was to rest dave , letting him run free behind the sled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the pride of trace and trail was his , and , sick unto death , he could not bear that another dog should do his work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the sled started , he floundered in the soft snow alongside the beaten trail , attacking sol - leks with his teeth , rushing against him and trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side , striving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled , and all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the half - breed tried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no heed to the stinging lash , and the man had not the heart to strike harder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled , where the going was easy , but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow , where the going was most difficult , till exhausted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind till the train made another stop , when he floundered past the sleds to his own , where he stood alongside sol - leks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his driver lingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he returned and started his dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of exertion , turned their heads uneasily , and stopped in surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dave had bitten through both of sol - leks s traces , and was standing directly in front of the sled in his proper place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied the work that killed it , and recalled instances they had known , where dogs , too old for the toil , or injured , had died because they were cut out of the traces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he was harnessed in again , and proudly he pulled as of old , though more than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> several times he fell down and was dragged in the traces , and once the sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he held out till camp was reached , when his driver made a place for him by the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morning found him too weak to travel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at harness - up time he tried to crawl to his driver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by convulsive efforts he got on his feet , staggered , and fell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement , when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more inches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the men ceased talking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a revolver - shot rang out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thirty days from the time it left dawson , the salt water mail , with buck and his mates at the fore , arrived at skaguay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were in a wretched state , worn out and worn down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck s one hundred and forty pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rest of his mates , though lighter dogs , had relatively lost more weight than he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sol - leks was limping , and dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder - blade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were all terribly footsore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no spring or rebound was left in them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their feet fell heavily on the trail , jarring their bodies and doubling the fatigue of a day s travel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was nothing the matter with them except that they were dead tired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no power of recuperation left , no reserve strength to call upon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it had been all used , the last least bit of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every muscle , every fibre , every cell , was tired , dead tired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in less than five months they had travelled twenty - five hundred miles , during the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days  rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they could barely keep the traces taut , and on the down grades just managed to keep out of the way of the sled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mush on , poor sore feets , the driver encouraged them as they tottered down the main street of skaguay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dis is de las  . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for sure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one bully long res  . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the drivers confidently expected a long stopover . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but so many were the men who had rushed into the klondike , and so many were the sweethearts , wives , and kin that had not rushed in , that the congested mail was taking on alpine proportions; also , there were official orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fresh batches of hudson bay dogs were to take the places of those worthless for the trail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the worthless ones were to be got rid of , and , since dogs count for little against dollars , they were to be sold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three days passed , by which time buck and his mates found how really tired and weak they were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , on the morning of the fourth day , two men from the states came along and bought them , harness and all , for a song . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the men addressed each other as  - hal and  - charles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charles was a middle - aged , lightish - colored man , with weak and watery eyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up , giving the lie to the limply drooping lip it concealed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hal was a youngster of nineteen or twenty , with a big colt s revolver and a hunting - knife strapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this belt was the most salient thing about him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it advertised his callownessa callowness sheer and unutterable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> both men were manifestly out of place , and why such as they should adventure the north is part of the mystery of things that passes understanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck heard the chaffering , saw the money pass between the man and the government agent , and knew that the scotch half - breed and the mail - train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of perrault and franois and the others who had gone before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent and load the sled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a great deal of effort about their manner , but no businesslike method . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tent was rolled into an awkward bundle three times as large as it should have been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tin dishes were packed away unwashed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on , grinning and winking at one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - undreamed of! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - however in the world could i manage without a tent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s springtime , and you won t get any more cold weather , the man replied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she shook her head decidedly , and charles and hal put the last odds and ends on top the mountainous load . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - think it ll ride? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the men asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why shouldn t it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charles demanded rather shortly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , that s all right , that s all right , the man hastened meekly to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was just a - wonderin  , that is all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed a mite top - heavy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an  of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption behind them , affirmed a second of the men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , said hal , with freezing politeness , taking hold of the gee - pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shouted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mush on there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were unable to move the sled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the lazy brutes , i ll show them , he cried , preparing to lash out at them with the whip . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the poor dears! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now you must promise you won t be harsh with them for the rest of the trip , or i won t go a step . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - precious lot you know about dogs , her brother sneered;  - and i wish you d leave me alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they re lazy , i tell you , and you ve got to whip them to get anything out of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that s their way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you ask any one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ask one of those men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they re weak as water , if you want to know , came the reply from one of the men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - plum tuckered out , that s what s the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she was a clannish creature , and rushed at once to the defence of her brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never mind that man , she said pointedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again hal s whip fell upon the dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after two efforts , they stood still , panting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she dropped on her knees before buck , with tears in her eyes , and put her arms around his neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck did not like her , but he was feeling too miserable to resist her , taking it as part of the day s miserable work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the onlookers , who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot speech , now spoke up: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s not that i care a whoop what becomes of you , but for the dogs  sakes i just want to tell you , you can help them a mighty lot by breaking out that sled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead , buck and his mates struggling frantically under the rain of blows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a hundred yards ahead the path turned and sloped steeply into the main street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would have required an experienced man to keep the top - heavy sled upright , and hal was not such a man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they swung on the turn the sled went over , spilling half its load through the loose lashings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lightened sled bounded on its side behind them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck was raging . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he broke into a run , the team following his lead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hal cried  - whoa! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whoa! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but they gave no heed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he tripped and was pulled off his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the capsized sled ground over him , and the dogs dashed on up the street , adding to the gayety of skaguay as they scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kind - hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered belongings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> also , they gave advice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hal and his sister and brother - in - law listened unwillingly , pitched tent , and overhauled the outfit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - half as many is too much; get rid of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercedes cried when her clothes - bags were dumped on the ground and article after article was thrown out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she cried in general , and she cried in particular over each discarded thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she clasped hands about knees , rocking back and forth broken - heartedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she appealed to everybody and to everything , finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and in her zeal , when she had finished with her own , she attacked the belongings of her men and went through them like a tornado . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charles and hal went out in the evening and bought six outside dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the outside dogs , though practically broken in since their landing , did not amount to much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did not seem to know anything , these newcomers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck and his comrades looked upon them with disgust , and though he speedily taught them their places and what not to do , he could not teach them what to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did not take kindly to trace and trail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the exception of the two mongrels , they were bewildered and spirit - broken by the strange savage environment in which they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two mongrels were without spirit at all; bones were the only things breakable about them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the newcomers hopeless and forlorn , and the old team worn out by twenty - five hundred miles of continuous trail , the outlook was anything but bright . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two men , however , were quite cheerful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and they were proud , too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were doing the thing in style , with fourteen dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the nature of arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should not drag one sled , and that was that one sled could not carry the food for fourteen dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had worked the trip out with a pencil , so much to a dog , so many dogs , so many days , q . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>e . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>d . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded comprehensively , it was all so very simple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were starting dead weary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his heart was not in the work , nor was the heart of any dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the outsides were timid and frightened , the insides without confidence in their masters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were slack in all things , without order or discipline . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it took them half the night to pitch a slovenly camp , and half the morning to break that camp and get the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some days they did not make ten miles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on other days they were unable to get started at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was inevitable that they should go short on dog - food . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but they hastened it by overfeeding , bringing the day nearer when underfeeding would commence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and to cap it all , when mercedes , with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat , could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more , she stole from the fish - sacks and fed them slyly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was not food that buck and the huskies needed , but rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and though they were making poor time , the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then came the underfeeding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hal awoke one day to the fact that his dog - food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further , that for love or money no additional dog - food was to be obtained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his sister and brother - in - law seconded him; but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not only did they not know how to work dogs , but they did not know how to work themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his wrenched shoulder - blade , untreated and unrested , went from bad to worse , till finally hal shot him with the big colt s revolver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the newfoundland went first , followed by the three short - haired pointers , the two mongrels hanging more grittily on to life , but going in the end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the southland had fallen away from the three people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs , being too occupied with weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their irritability arose out of their misery , increased with it , doubled upon it , outdistanced it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore , and remain sweet of speech and kindly , did not come to these two men and the woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had no inkling of such a patience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were stiff and in pain; their muscles ached , their bones ached , their very hearts ached; and because of this they became sharp of speech , and hard words were first on their lips in the morning and last at night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the work , and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes mercedes sided with her husband , sometimes with her brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that hal s views on art , or the sort of society plays his mother s brother wrote , should have anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood , passes comprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that direction as in the direction of charles s political prejudices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and that charles s sister s tale - bearing tongue should be relevant to the building of a yukon fire , was apparent only to mercedes , who disburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic , and incidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her husband s family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercedes nursed a special grievancethe grievance of sex . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was pretty and soft , and had been chivalrously treated all her days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they complained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex - prerogative , she made their lives unendurable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she no longer considered the dogs , and because she was sore and tired , she persisted in riding on the sled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was pretty and soft , but she weighed one hundred and twenty poundsa lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she rode for days , till they fell in the traces and the sled stood still . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charles and hal begged her to get off and walk , pleaded with her , entreated , the while she wept and importuned heaven with a recital of their brutality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they never did it again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she let her legs go limp like a spoiled child , and sat down on the trail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they went on their way , but she did not move . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after they had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled , came back for her , and by main strength put her on the sled again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of their animals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had started out preaching it to his sister and brother - in - law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> failing there , he hammered it into the dogs with a club . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the five fingers the dog - food gave out , and a toothless old squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse - hide for the colt s revolver that kept the big hunting - knife company at hal s hip . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a poor substitute for food was this hide , just as it had been stripped from the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and through it all buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a nightmare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull , he fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to his feet again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his beautiful furry coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hair hung down , limp and draggled , or matted with dried blood where hal s club had bruised him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was heartbreaking , only buck s heart was unbreakable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man in the red sweater had proved that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as it was with buck , so was it with his mates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were perambulating skeletons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in their very great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the bruise of the club . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pain of the beating was dull and distant , just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and distant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were not half living , or quarter living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when a halt was made , they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs , and the spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when the club or whip fell upon them , the spark fluttered feebly up , and they tottered to their feet and staggered on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there came a day when billee , the good - natured , fell and could not rise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hal had traded off his revolver , so he took the axe and knocked billee on the head as he lay in the traces , then cut the carcass out of the harness and dragged it to one side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was beautiful spring weather , but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was dawn by three in the morning , and twilight lingered till nine at night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole long day was a blaze of sunshine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this murmur arose from all the land , fraught with the joy of living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it came from the things that lived and moved again , things which had been as dead and which had not moved during the long months of frost . </s> </s>

<s> <s> john thornton and buck looked at each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you poor devil , said john thornton , and buck licked his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when john thornton froze his feet in the previous december his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well , going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw - logs for dawson . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and here , lying by the river bank through the long spring days , watching the running water , listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature , buck slowly won back his strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> skeet was a little irish setter who early made friends with buck , who , in a dying condition , was unable to resent her first advances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a mother cat washes her kittens , so she washed and cleansed buck s wounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nig , equally friendly , though less demonstrative , was a huge black dog , half bloodhound and half deerhound , with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of john thornton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as buck grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games , in which thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this he had never experienced at judge miller s down in the sun - kissed santa clara valley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the judge s sons , hunting and tramping , it had been a working partnership; with the judge s grandsons , a sort of pompous guardianship; and with the judge himself , a stately and dignified friendship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but love that was feverish and burning , that was adoration , that was madness , it had taken john thornton to arouse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man had saved his life , which was something; but , further , he was the ideal master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a sense of duty and business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as if they were his own children , because he could not help it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he saw further . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word , and to sit down for a long talk with them (  - gas he called it ) was as much his delight as theirs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had a way of taking buck s head roughly between his hands , and resting his own head upon buck s , of shaking him back and forth , the while calling him ill names that to buck were love names . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when , released , he sprang to his feet , his mouth laughing , his eyes eloquent , his throat vibrant with unuttered sound , and in that fashion remained without movement , john thornton would reverently exclaim ,  - god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would often seize thornton s hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as buck understood the oaths to be love words , so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the most part , however , buck s love was expressed in adoration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he went wild with happiness when thornton touched him or spoke to him , he did not seek these tokens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unlike skeet , who was wont to shove her nose under thornton s hand and nudge and nudge till petted , or nig , who would stalk up and rest his great head on thornton s knee , buck was content to adore at a distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would lie by the hour , eager , alert , at thornton s feet , looking up into his face , dwelling upon it , studying it , following with keenest interest each fleeting expression , every movement or change of feature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or , as chance might have it , he would lie farther away , to the side or rear , watching the outlines of the man and the occasional movements of his body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and often , such was the communion in which they lived , the strength of buck s gaze would draw john thornton s head around , and he would return the gaze , without speech , his heart shining out of his eyes as buck s heart shone out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a long time after his rescue , buck did not like thornton to get out of his sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the moment he left the tent to when he entered it again , buck would follow at his heels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even in the night , in his dreams , he was haunted by this fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at such times he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the tent , where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master s breathing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faithfulness and devotion , things born of fire and roof , were his; yet he retained his wildness and wiliness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> because of his very great love , he could not steal from this man , but from any other man , in any other camp , he did not hesitate an instant; while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and buck was merciless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had learned well the law of club and fang , and he never forewent an advantage or drew back from a foe he had started on the way to death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had lessoned from spitz , and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail , and knew there was no middle course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he must master or be mastered; while to show mercy was a weakness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was misunderstood for fear , and such misunderstandings made for death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kill or be killed , eat or be eaten , was the law; and this mandate , down out of the depths of time , he obeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sat by john thornton s fire , a broad - breasted dog , white - fanged and long - furred; but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs , half - wolves and wild wolves , urgent and prompting , tasting the savor of the meat he ate , thirsting for the water he drank , scenting the wind with him , listening with him and telling him the sounds made by the wild life in the forest , dictating his moods , directing his actions , lying down to sleep with him when he lay down , and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff of his dreams . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so peremptorily did these shades beckon him , that each day mankind and the claims of mankind slipped farther from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> deep in the forest a call was sounding , and as often as he heard this call , mysteriously thrilling and luring , he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and the beaten earth around it , and to plunge into the forest , and on and on , he knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why , the call sounding imperiously , deep in the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade , the love for john thornton drew him back to the fire again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton alone held him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> chance travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all , and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when thornton s partners , hans and pete , arrived on the long - expected raft , buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to thornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way , accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were of the same large type as thornton , living close to the earth , thinking simply and seeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the saw - mill at dawson , they understood buck and his ways , and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with skeet and nig . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for thornton , however , his love seemed to grow and grow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing was too great for buck to do , when thornton commanded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day ( they had grub - staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left dawson for the head - waters of the tanana ) the men and dogs were sitting on the crest of a cliff which fell away , straight down , to naked bed - rock three hundred feet below . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> john thornton was sitting near the edge , buck at his shoulder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a thoughtless whim seized thornton , and he drew the attention of hans and pete to the experiment he had in mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - jump , buck! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he commanded , sweeping his arm out and over the chasm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next instant he was grappling with buck on the extreme edge , while hans and pete were dragging them back into safety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s uncanny , pete said , after it was over and they had caught their speech . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , it is splendid , and it is terrible , too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you know , it sometimes makes me afraid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i m not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he s around , pete announced conclusively , nodding his head toward buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - py jingo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was hans s contribution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not mineself either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was at circle city , ere the year was out , that pete s apprehensions were realized . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - black burton , a man evil - tempered and malicious , had been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar , when thornton stepped good - naturedly between . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck , as was his custom , was lying in a corner , head on paws , watching his master s every action . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> burton struck out , without warning , straight from the shoulder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp , but a something which is best described as a roar , and they saw buck s body rise up in the air as he left the floor for burton s throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck loosed his teeth from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time the man succeeded only in partly blocking , and his throat was torn open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the crowd was upon buck , and he was driven off; but while a surgeon checked the bleeding , he prowled up and down , growling furiously , attempting to rush in , and being forced back by an array of hostile clubs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a  - miners  meeting , called on the spot , decided that the dog had sufficient provocation , and buck was discharged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but his reputation was made , and from that day his name spread through every camp in alaska . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> later on , in the fall of the year , he saved john thornton s life in quite another fashion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the three partners were lining a long and narrow poling - boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the forty - mile creek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck , on the bank , worried and anxious , kept abreast of the boat , his eyes never off his master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at a particularly bad spot , where a ledge of barely submerged rocks jutted out into the river , hans cast off the rope , and , while thornton poled the boat out into the stream , ran down the bank with the end in his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boat flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up , while thornton , flung sheer out of it , was carried down - stream toward the worst part of the rapids , a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred yards , amid a mad swirl of water , he overhauled thornton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the progress shoreward was slow; the progress down - stream amazingly rapid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from below came the fatal roaring where the wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the rocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he clutched its slippery top with both hands , releasing buck , and above the roar of the churning water shouted:  - go , buck! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck could not hold his own , and swept on down - stream , struggling desperately , but unable to win back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he heard thornton s command repeated , he partly reared out of the water , throwing his head high , as though for a last look , then turned obediently toward the bank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the face of that driving current was a matter of minutes , and they ran as fast as they could up the bank to a point far above where thornton was hanging on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to buck s neck and shoulders , being careful that it should neither strangle him nor impede his swimming , and launched him into the stream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he discovered the mistake too late , when thornton was abreast of him and a bare half - dozen strokes away while he was being carried helplessly past . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current , he was jerked under the surface , and under the surface he remained till his body struck against the bank and he was hauled out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was half drowned , and hans and pete threw themselves upon him , pounding the breath into him and the water out of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he staggered to his feet and fell down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the faint sound of thornton s voice came to them , and though they could not make out the words of it , they knew that he was in his extremity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his master s voice acted on buck like an electric shock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sprang to his feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous departure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again the rope was attached and he was launched , and again he struck out , but this time straight into the stream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had miscalculated once , but he would not be guilty of it a second time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton saw him coming , and , as buck struck him like a battering ram , with the whole force of the current behind him , he reached up and closed with both arms around the shaggy neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hans snubbed the rope around the tree , and buck and thornton were jerked under the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> strangling , suffocating , sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other , dragging over the jagged bottom , smashing against rocks and snags , they veered in to the bank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton came to , belly downward and being violently propelled back and forth across a drift log by hans and pete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his first glance was for buck , over whose limp and apparently lifeless body nig was setting up a howl , while skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we camp right here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and camp they did , till buck s ribs knitted and he was able to travel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that winter , at dawson , buck performed another exploit , not so heroic , perhaps , but one that put his name many notches higher on the totem - pole of alaskan fame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this exploit was particularly gratifying to the three men; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished , and were enabled to make a long - desired trip into the virgin east , where miners had not yet appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was brought about by a conversation in the eldorado saloon , in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of half an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for his dog; and a third , seven hundred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pooh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said john thornton;  - buck can start a thousand pounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and walk off with it for a hundred yards? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded matthewson , a bonanza king , he of the seven hundred vaunt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and there it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his tongue had tricked him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not know whether buck could start a thousand pounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> half a ton! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had great faith in buck s strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a load; but never , as now , had he faced the possibility of it , the eyes of a dozen men fixed upon him , silent and waiting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton did not reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the face of jim o brien , a mastodon king and old - time comrade , caught his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was as a cue to him , seeming to rouse him to do what he would never have dreamed of doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can you lend me a thousand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked , almost in a whisper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - though it s little faith i m having , john , that the beast can do the trick . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tables were deserted , and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see the outcome of the wager and to lay odds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> several hundred men , furred and mittened , banked around the sled within easy distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> matthewson s sled , loaded with a thousand pounds of flour , had been standing for a couple of hours , and in the intense cold ( it was sixty below zero ) the runners had frozen fast to the hard - packed snow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> o brien contended it was thornton s privilege to knock the runners loose , leaving buck to  - break it out from a dead standstill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a majority of the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor , whereat the odds went up to three to one against buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not a man believed him capable of the feat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton had been hurried into the wager , heavy with doubt; and now that he looked at the sled itself , the concrete fact , with the regular team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it , the more impossible the task appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> matthewson waxed jubilant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - three to one! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he proclaimed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll lay you another thousand at that figure , thornton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what d ye say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton s doubt was strong in his face , but his fighting spirit was arousedthe fighting spirit that soars above odds , fails to recognize the impossible , and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he called hans and pete to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the ebb of their fortunes , this sum was their total capital; yet they laid it unhesitatingly against matthewson s six hundred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the team of ten dogs was unhitched , and buck , with his own harness , was put into the sled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had caught the contagion of the excitement , and he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for john thornton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was in perfect condition , without an ounce of superfluous flesh , and the one hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and virility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his furry coat shone with the sheen of silk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> down the neck and across the shoulders , his mane , in repose as it was , half bristled and seemed to lift with every movement , as though excess of vigor made each particular hair alive and active . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the great breast and heavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the body , where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men felt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron , and the odds went down to two to one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gad , sir! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gad , sir! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i offer you eight hundred for him , sir , before the test , sir; eight hundred just as he stands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must stand off from him , matthewson protested . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - free play and plenty of room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers vainly offering two to one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton knelt down by buck s side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took his head in his two hands and rested cheek on cheek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not playfully shake him , as was his wont , or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as you love me , buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as you love me , was what he whispered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck whined with suppressed eagerness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the crowd was watching curiously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed like a conjuration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as thornton got to his feet , buck seized his mittened hand between his jaws , pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly , half - reluctantly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the answer , in terms , not of speech , but of love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton stepped well back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , buck , he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck tightened the traces , then slacked them for a matter of several inches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton s voice rang out , sharp in the tense silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck swung to the right , ending the movement in a plunge that took up the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty pounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the load quivered , and from under the runners arose a crisp crackling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - haw! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck duplicated the manuvre , this time to the left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sled was broken out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men were holding their breaths , intensely unconscious of the fact . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he was unafraid of the wild . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to buck it was boundless delight , this hunting , fishing , and indefinite wandering through strange places . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for weeks at a time they would hold on steadily , day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp , here and there , the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once , they came upon a path blazed through the forest , an ancient path , and the lost cabin seemed very near . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the path began nowhere and ended nowhere , and it remained mystery , as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spring came on once more , and at the end of all their wandering they found , not the lost cabin , but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing - pan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets , and they worked every day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gold was sacked in moose - hide bags , fifty pounds to the bag , and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce - bough lodge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was nothing for the dogs to do , save the hauling in of meat now and again that thornton killed , and buck spent long hours musing by the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> through the forest they crept noiselessly , buck at the hairy man s heels; and they were alert and vigilant , the pair of them , ears twitching and moving and nostrils quivering , for the man heard and smelled as keenly as buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the ground , swinging by the arms from limb to limb , sometimes a dozen feet apart , letting go and catching , never falling , never missing his grip . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact , he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the ground; and buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath trees wherein the hairy man roosted , holding on tightly as he slept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still sounding in the depths of the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it filled him with a great unrest and strange desires . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes he pursued the call into the forest , looking for it as though it were a tangible thing , barking softly or defiantly , as the mood might dictate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss , or into the black soil where long grasses grew , and snort with joy at the fat earth smells; or he would crouch for hours , as if in concealment , behind fungus - covered trunks of fallen trees , wide - eyed and wide - eared to all that moved and sounded about him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it might be , lying thus , that he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he did not know why he did these various things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> irresistible impulses seized him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would be lying in camp , dozing lazily in the heat of the day , when suddenly his head would lift and his ears cock up , intent and listening , and he would spring to his feet and dash away , and on and on , for hours , through the forest aisles and across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he loved to run down dry watercourses , and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the woods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights , listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest , reading signs and sounds as man may read a book , and seeking for the mysterious something that calledcalled , waking or sleeping , at all times , for him to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one night he sprang from sleep with a start , eager - eyed , nostrils quivering and scenting , his mane bristling in recurrent waves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the forest came the call ( or one note of it , for the call was many noted ) , distinct and definite as never before ,a long - drawn howl , like , yet unlike , any noise made by husky dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he knew it , in the old familiar way , as a sound heard before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly , with caution in every movement , till he came to an open place among the trees , and looking out saw , erect on haunches , with nose pointed to the sky , a long , lean , timber wolf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had made no noise , yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck stalked into the open , half crouching , body gathered compactly together , tail straight and stiff , feet falling with unwonted care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of friendliness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the wolf fled at sight of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he followed , with wild leapings , in a frenzy to overtake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he ran him into a blind channel , in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wolf whirled about , pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of joe and of all cornered husky dogs , snarling and bristling , clipping his teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck did not attack , but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wolf was suspicious and afraid; for buck made three of him in weight , while his head barely reached buck s shoulder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> watching his chance , he darted away , and the chase was resumed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> time and again he was cornered , and the thing repeated , though he was in poor condition , or buck could not so easily have overtaken him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would run till buck s head was even with his flank , when he would whirl around at bay , only to dash away again at the first opportunity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they became friendly , and played about in the nervous , half - coy way with which fierce beasts belie their fierceness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after some time of this the wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made it clear to buck that he was to come , and they ran side by side through the sombre twilight , straight up the creek bed , into the gorge from which it issued , and across the bleak divide where it took its rise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level country where were great stretches of forest and many streams , and through these great stretches they ran steadily , hour after hour , the sun rising higher and the day growing warmer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck was wildly glad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had done this thing before , somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world , and he was doing it again , now , running free in the open , the unpacked earth underfoot , the wide sky overhead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they stopped by a running stream to drink , and , stopping , buck remembered john thornton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sat down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wolf started on toward the place from where the call surely came , then returned to him , sniffing noses and making actions as though to encourage him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the better part of an hour the wild brother ran by his side , whining softly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he sat down , pointed his nose upward , and howled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for two days and nights buck never left camp , never let thornton out of his sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he followed him about at his work , watched him while he ate , saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously than ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck s restlessness came back on him , and he was haunted by recollections of the wild brother , and of the smiling land beyond the divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he began to sleep out at night , staying away from camp for days at a time; and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went down into the land of timber and streams . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there he wandered for a week , seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother , killing his meat as he travelled and travelling with the long , easy lope that seems never to tire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into the sea , and by this stream he killed a large black bear , blinded by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing , and raging through the forest helpless and terrible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even so , it was a hard fight , and it aroused the last latent remnants of buck s ferocity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and two days later , when he returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the spoil , he scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two behind who would quarrel no more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself , which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it advertised itself in all his movements , was apparent in the play of every muscle , spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself , and made his glorious furry coat if anything more glorious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes , and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest , he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf , larger than the largest of the breed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bernard father he had inherited size and weight , but it was his shepherd mother who had given shape to that size and weight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bernard intelligence; and all this , plus an experience gained in the fiercest of schools , made him as formidable a creature as any that roamed the wild . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when thornton passed a caressing hand along his back , a snapping and crackling followed the hand , each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to sights and sounds and events which required action , he responded with lightning - like rapidity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> quickly as a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack , he could leap twice as quickly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw the movement , or heard sound , and responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or hearing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in point of fact the three actions of perceiving , determining , and responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his muscles were surcharged with vitality , and snapped into play sharply , like steel springs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> life streamed through him in splendid flood , glad and rampant , until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and pour forth generously over the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never was there such a dog , said john thornton one day , as the partners watched buck marching out of camp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i t ink so mineself , hans affirmed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they saw him marching out of camp , but they did not see the instant and terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy of the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he no longer marched . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at once he became a thing of the wild , stealing along softly , cat - footed , a passing shadow that appeared and disappeared among the shadows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could take a ptarmigan from its nest , kill a rabbit as it slept , and snap in mid air the little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fish , in open pools , were not too quick for him; nor were beaver , mending their dams , too wary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he killed to eat , not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he killed himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so a lurking humor ran through his deeds , and it was his delight to steal upon the squirrels , and , when he all but had them , to let them go , chattering in mortal fear to the treetops . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck had already dragged down a stray part - grown calf; but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry , and he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was in a savage temper , and , standing over six feet from the ground , was as formidable an antagonist as even buck could desire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the bull s side , just forward of the flank , protruded a feathered arrow - end , which accounted for his savageness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world , buck proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on , the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at such moments he charged buck , who retreated craftily , luring him on by a simulated inability to escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when he was thus separated from his fellows , two or three of the younger bulls would charge back upon buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a patience of the wilddogged , tireless , persistent as life itselfthat holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web , the snake in its coils , the panther in its ambuscade; this patience belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it belonged to buck as he clung to the flank of the herd , retarding its march , irritating the young bulls , worrying the cows with their half - grown calves , and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for half a day this continued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest ( the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long ) , the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the aid of their beset leader . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the down - coming winter was harrying them on to the lower levels , and it seemed they could never shake off this tireless creature that held them back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , it was not the life of the herd , or of the young bulls , that was threatened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head , watching his matesthe cows he had known , the calves he had fathered , the bulls he had masteredas they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not follow , for before his nose leaped the merciless fanged terror that would not let him go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from then on , night and day , buck never left his prey , never gave it a moment s rest , never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the shoots of young birch and willow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor did he give the wounded bull opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams they crossed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> often , in desperation , he burst into long stretches of flight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at such times buck did not attempt to stay him , but loped easily at his heels , satisfied with the way the game was played , lying down when the moose stood still , attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat or drink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took to standing for long periods , with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at such moments , panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull , it appeared to buck that a change was coming over the face of things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the moose were coming into the land , other kinds of life were coming in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the news of it was borne in upon him , not by sight , or sound , or smell , but by some other and subtler sense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he heard nothing , saw nothing , yet knew that the land was somehow different; that through it strange things were afoot and ranging; and he resolved to investigate after he had finished the business in hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a day and a night he remained by the kill , eating and sleeping , turn and turn about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , rested , refreshed and strong , he turned his face toward camp and john thornton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he broke into the long easy lope , and went on , hour after hour , never at loss for the tangled way , heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was life abroad in it different from the life which had been there throughout the summer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no longer was this fact borne in upon him in some subtle , mysterious way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the birds talked of it , the squirrels chattered about it , the very breeze whispered of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> several times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs , reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling and bristling , it led straight toward camp and john thornton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck hurried on , swiftly and stealthily , every nerve straining and tense , alert to the multitudinous details which told a storyall but the end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the life on the heels of which he was travelling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remarked the pregnant silence of the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bird life had flitted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one only he saw ,a sleek gray fellow , flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it , a woody excrescence upon the wood itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow , his nose was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was lying on his side , dead where he had dragged himself , an arrow protruding , head and feathers , from either side of his body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a hundred yards farther on , buck came upon one of the sled - dogs thornton had bought in dawson . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the camp came the faint sound of many voices , rising and falling in a sing - song chant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bellying forward to the edge of the clearing , he found hans , lying on his face , feathered with arrows like a porcupine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason , and it was because of his great love for john thornton that he lost his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was buck , a live hurricane of fury , hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sprang at the foremost man ( it was the chief of the yeehats ) , ripping the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not pause to worry the victim , but ripped in passing , with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact , so inconceivably rapid were his movements , and so closely were the indians tangled together , that they shot one another with the arrows; and one young hunter , hurling a spear at buck in mid air , drove it through the chest of another hunter with such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a fateful day for the yeehats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they scattered far and wide over the country , and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pool itself , muddy and discolored from the sluice boxes , effectually hid what it contained , and it contained john thornton; for buck followed his trace into the water , from which no trace led away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all day buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> death , as a cessation of movement , as a passing out and away from the lives of the living , he knew , and he knew john thornton was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it left a great void in him , somewhat akin to hunger , but a void which ached and ached , and which food could not fill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at times , when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the yeehats , he forgot the pain of it; and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself ,a pride greater than any he had yet experienced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had killed man , the noblest game of all , and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sniffed the bodies curiously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had died so easily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was harder to kill a husky dog than them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were no match at all , were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thenceforward he would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows , spears , and clubs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> night came on , and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky , lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from far away drifted a faint , sharp yelp , followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he walked to the centre of the open space and listened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the call , the many - noted call , sounding more luringly and compellingly than ever before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> john thornton was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> man and the claims of man no longer bound him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> into the clearing where the moonlight streamed , they poured in a silvery flood; and in the centre of the clearing stood buck , motionless as a statue , waiting their coming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like a flash buck struck , breaking the neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three others tried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they drew back , streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward , pell - mell , crowded together , blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck s marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pivoting on his hind legs , and snapping and gashing , he was everywhere at once , presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to prevent them from getting behind him , he was forced back , down past the pool and into the creek bed , till he brought up against a high gravel bank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining , and in this angle he came to bay , protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so well did he face it , that at the end of half an hour the wolves drew back discomfited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some were lying down with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their feet , watching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one wolf , long and lean and gray , advanced cautiously , in a friendly manner , and buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night and a day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was whining softly , and , as buck whined , they touched noses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then an old wolf , gaunt and battle - scarred , came forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the others sat down and howled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now the call came to buck in unmistakable accents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he , too , sat down and howled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this over , he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him , sniffing in half - friendly , half - savage manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the leaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and here may well end the story of buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the years were not many when the yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle , and with a rift of white centring down the chest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but more remarkable than this , the yeehats tell of a ghost dog that runs at the head of the pack . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are afraid of this ghost dog , for it has cunning greater than they , stealing from their camps in fierce winters , robbing their traps , slaying their dogs , and defying their bravest hunters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each fall , when the yeehats follow the movement of the moose , there is a certain valley which they never enter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and women there are who become sad when the word goes over the fire of how the evil spirit came to select that valley for an abiding - place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the summers there is one visitor , however , to that valley , of which the yeehats do not know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a great , gloriously coated wolf , like , and yet unlike , all other wolves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here a yellow stream flows from rotted moose - hide sacks and sinks into the ground , with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses for a time , howling once , long and mournfully , ere he departs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he is not always alone . </s> </s>
