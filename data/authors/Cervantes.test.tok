<s> <s>  - from all you have told me , dear brethren , i make out clearly that though they have punished you for your faults , the punishments you are about to endure do not give you much pleasure , and that you go to them very much against the grain and against your will , and that perhaps this one s want of courage under torture , that one s want of money , the other s want of advocacy , and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on your side . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the gift and compensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped the landlord s notice , and he demanded don quixote s reckoning , together with the amount of the damage to his wine - skins , and the loss of his wine , swearing that neither rocinante nor sancho s ass should leave the inn until he had been paid to the very last farthing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sterility or estility , answered pedro ,  - it is all the same in the end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let your worship get up , said sancho ,  - and you will see the nice business you have made of it , and what we have to pay; and you will see the queen turned into a private lady called dorothea , and other things that will astonish you , if you understand them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they went to meet him , and in answer to their inquiries about don quixote , he told them how he had found him stripped to his shirt , lank , yellow , half dead with hunger , and sighing for his lady dulcinea; and although he had told him that she commanded him to quit that place and come to el toboso , where she was expecting him , he had answered that he was determined not to appear in the presence of her beauty until he had done deeds to make him worthy of her favour; and if this went on , sancho said , he ran the risk of not becoming an emperor as in duty bound , or even an archbishop , which was the least he could be; for which reason they ought to consider what was to be done to get him away from there . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it is with that kind of love , said sancho ,  - i have heard preachers say we ought to love our lord , for himself alone , without being moved by the hope of glory or the fear of punishment; though for my part , i would rather love and serve him for what he could do . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at length he learned that my parents were contemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes of obtaining possession of me , or at least to secure additional protectors to watch over me , and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as you shall hear . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - there is no occasion , seor , for wasting time or money on making that countenance , said sancho;  - for all that need be done is for your worship to show your own , face to face , to those who look at you , and without anything more , either image or shield , they will call you him of the rueful countenance  and believe me i am telling you the truth , for i assure you , seor ( and in good part be it said ) , hunger and the loss of your grinders have given you such an ill - favoured face that , as i say , the rueful picture may be very well spared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of listening to him , but that the details he mentioned interested them greatly , being of a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of the same attention as the main story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he went on stringing together these and other absurdities , all in the style of those his books had taught him , imitating their language as well as he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun mounted so rapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt his brains if he had any . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what apocryphal , ill - devised incidents , attributing to one saint the miracles of another! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he told him he was quite right in pursuing the object he had in view , and that such a motive was natural and becoming in cavaliers as distinguished as he seemed and his gallant bearing showed him to be; and that he himself in his younger days had followed the same honourable calling , roaming in quest of adventures in various parts of the world , among others the curing - grounds of malaga , the isles of riaran , the precinct of seville , the little market of segovia , the olivera of valencia , the rondilla of granada , the strand of san lucar , the colt of cordova , the taverns of toledo , and divers other quarters , where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and the lightness of his fingers , doing many wrongs , cheating many widows , ruining maids and swindling minors , and , in short , bringing himself under the notice of almost every tribunal and court of justice in spain; until at last he had retired to this castle of his , where he was living upon his property and upon that of others; and where he received all knights - errant of whatever rank or condition they might be , all for the great love he bore them and that they might share their substance with him in return for his benevolence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then put on his hat , which was broad enough to serve him for an umbrella , and enveloping himself in his cloak seated himself woman - fashion on his mule , while the barber mounted his with a beard down to the waist of mingled red and white , for it was , as has been said , the tail of a clay - red ox . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say this because we all know one another , and it will not do to throw false dice with me; and as to the enchantment of my master , god knows the truth; leave it as it is; it only makes it worse to stir it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> writers there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of puerto lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; but what i have ascertained on this point , and what i have found written in the annals of la mancha , is that he was on the road all day , and towards nightfall his hack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry , when , looking all around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd s shanty where he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants , he perceived not far out of his road an inn , which was as welcome as a star guiding him to the portals , if not the palaces , of his redemption; and quickening his pace he reached it just as night was setting in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he replied they might say what they liked , for he was not in a state to give advice that would be of any use; all he could tell her was to try and stanch the blood , as he was going where he should never more be seen; and with every appearance of deep grief and sorrow he left the house; but when he found himself alone , and where there was nobody to see him , he crossed himself unceasingly , lost in wonder at the adroitness of camilla and the consistent acting of leonela . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by so doing , replied don quixote ,  - shalt thou live long on the face of the earth; for next to parents , masters are to be respected as though they were parents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fortune , however , arranged the matter better than they expected , for all sancho did was to fling himself on his master s body , raising over him the most doleful and laughable lamentation that ever was heard , for he believed he was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an agreement to this effect was made between the friends , the ill - advised one and the treacherous , and anselmo returning to his house asked camilla the question she already wondered he had not asked beforewhat it was that had caused her to write the letter she had sent him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> they went it might be a hundred paces farther , when on turning a corner the true cause , beyond the possibility of any mistake , of that dread - sounding and to them awe - inspiring noise that had kept them all the night in such fear and perplexity , appeared plain and obvious; and it was ( if , reader , thou art not disgusted and disappointed ) six fulling hammers which by their alternate strokes made all the din . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , he ended by saying that what could and ought to be done was to give the money intended for the ransom of one of us christians to him , so that he might with it buy a vessel there in algiers under the pretence of becoming a merchant and trader at tetuan and along the coast; and when master of the vessel , it would be easy for him to hit on some way of getting us all out of the bano and putting us on board; especially if the moorish lady gave , as she said , money enough to ransom all , because once free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark even in open day; but the greatest difficulty was that the moors do not allow any renegade to buy or own any craft , unless it be a large vessel for going on roving expeditions , because they are afraid that anyone who buys a small vessel , especially if he be a spaniard , only wants it for the purpose of escaping to christian territory . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - <s> <s> the goatherd s tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers , and the canon especially enjoyed it , for he had remarked with particular attention the manner in which it had been told , which was as unlike the manner of a clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city wit; and he observed that the curate had been quite right in saying that the woods bred men of learning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would have avenged myself too if i could , said sancho ,  - whether i had been dubbed knight or not , but i could not; though for my part i am persuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms or enchanted men , as your worship says , but men of flesh and bone like ourselves; and they all had their names , for i heard them name them when they were tossing me , and one was called pedro martinez , and another tenorio hernandez , and the innkeeper , i heard , was called juan palomeque the left - handed; so that , seor , your not being able to leap over the wall of the yard or dismount from your horse came of something else besides enchantments; and what i make out clearly from all this is , that these adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into such misadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot; and that the best and wisest thing , according to my small wits , would be for us to return home , now that it is harvest - time , and attend to our business , and give over wandering from zeca to mecca and from pail to bucket , as the saying is . </s> </s>
