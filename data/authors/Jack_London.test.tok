<s> <s> so , on this great journey into the east , straight meat was the bill of fare , ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled , and the time - card was drawn upon the limitless future . </s> </s>

<s> <s> a rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles , and it must be confessed that buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed , his muscles swelled out , and the flesh came back to cover his bones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns , and the shambling trot grew weak and weaker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stuttered a member of the latest dynasty , a king of the skookum benches . </s> </s>

<s> <s> thornton shook his head and stepped to buck s side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for buck , wearying of the pursuit , he returned to the desolated camp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was all well enough in the southland , under the law of love and fellowship , to respect private property and personal feelings; but in the northland , under the law of club and fang , whoso took such things into account was a fool , and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper . </s> </s>

<s> <s> john thornton was eating dinner when buck dashed into camp and sprang upon him in a frenzy of affection , overturning him , scrambling upon him , licking his face , biting his hand - playing the general tom - fool , as john thornton characterized it , the while he shook buck back and forth and cursed him lovingly . </s> </s>

<s> <s> there were seven all together , including him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not know that he growled , but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck writhed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl , but sniffed noses with him , whereupon the old wolf sat down , pointed nose at the moon , and broke out the long wolf howl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the scotch half - breed called a halt and took him out of the team , making the next dog , sol - leks , fast to the sled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that was fair of franois , he decided , and the half - breed began his rise in buck s estimation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh , they were countered by the fangs of spitz . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as buck drew himself together to spring after them , out of the tail of his eye he saw spitz rush upon him with the evident intention of overthrowing him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his strength left him , and the last his mates saw of him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and on no day did they succeed in making more than half the distance used by the men as a basis in their dog - food computation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pike , the malingerer , who , in his lifetime of deceit , had often successfully feigned a hurt leg , was now limping in earnest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sol - leks was the first to crawl to his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s my dog , hal replied , wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he never nipped buck without cause , and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna sausage down upon the bar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light , while he roared with fury at sight of buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to buck s surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only spitz quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth , snarling with horrible menace , as though to frighten off impending death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was then that the unexpected happened , the thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future , past many a weary mile of trail and toil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils , and there , curled up under the snow in a snug ball , lay billee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but thornton fell on his knees beside buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hans and pete moved along the bank , snubbing with a thin manila rope from tree to tree , while thornton remained in the boat , helping its descent by means of a pole , and shouting directions to the shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his cunning was wolf cunning , and wild cunning; his intelligence , shepherd intelligence and st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when driven with his mates to the new owners  camp , buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair , tent half stretched , dishes unwashed , everything in disorder; also , he saw a woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> den we get one long res  . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was franois s speech next morning when he discovered spitz missing and buck covered with wounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in; also , the travel pride had gripped him , and he purposed to make the record trip of the year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first to go was dub . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here the train was halted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was ranging at the head of the pack , running the wild thing down , the living meat , to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well , and the big cement tank where judge miller s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when he was made , the mould was broke , said pete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> four times he had covered the distance between salt water and dawson , and the knowledge that , jaded and tired , he was facing the same trail once more , made him bitter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he alone endured and prospered , matching the husky in strength , savagery , and cunning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were short of weight and in poor condition when they made dawson , and should have had a ten days  or a week s rest at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois was obdurate , but when he turned his back buck again displaced sol - leks , who was not at all unwilling to go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour , making a total of nine , and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the dyea caon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did they walk by the beach of a sea , where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered , it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this manner had fought forgotten ancestors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was impelled to do them , and did not reason about them at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nobody spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> also , the dogs were fed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his eyes were wet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , his hands were full with his sister , or his arms , rather; while buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the rope was removed , and he was flung into a cagelike crate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life , and beyond which life cannot rise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he perceived and determined and responded in the same instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as never before , he was ready to obey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this lost mine was steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same instant buck peered out where the spruce - bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the months came and went , and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness , where no men were and yet where men had been if the lost cabin were true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can all but speak! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and with the coming of the night , brooding and mourning by the pool , buck became alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the yeehats had made , he stood up , listening and scenting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was the pride of dave as wheel - dog , of sol - leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp , transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining , eager , ambitious creatures; the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night , letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so that was the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he stood , without movement , as before , the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce - bough lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which they had never seen before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he could hear the crashing of their bodies through the undergrowth , and the noises they made in the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sniffed it curiously , then licked some up on his tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sled held as though it were an anchor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he watched the hairy man sleeping by the fire , head between his knees and hands clasped above , buck saw that he slept restlessly , with many starts and awakenings , at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness and fling more wood upon the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded till he cried out many times . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois followed him up , whereupon he again retreated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three hundredweight more than half a ton he weighed; he had lived a long , strong life , full of fight and struggle , and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> straight away he raced , with dolly , panting and frothing , one leap behind; nor could she gain on him , so great was his terror , nor could he leave her , so great was her madness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the opportunity did not present itself , and they pulled into dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and beyond that fire , in the circling darkness , buck could see many gleaming coals , two by two , always two by two , which he knew to be the eyes of great beasts of prey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the crackling turned into a snapping , the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and grating several inches to the side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hunters there are who fail to return to the camp , and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the prints of any wolf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once again he took to wandering in the woods , but the wild brother came no more; and though he listened through long vigils , the mournful howl was never raised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was fighting off two or three , it was disappearing down the throats of the others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck s senses came back to him , but not his strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sprang back , bristling and snarling , fearful of the unseen and unknown . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief , and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a saying of the country that an outside dog starves to death on the ration of the husky , so the six outside dogs under buck could do no less than die on half the ration of the husky . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck multiplied himself , attacking from all sides , enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace , cutting out his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates , wearing out the patience of creatures preyed upon , which is a lesser patience than that of creatures preying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out the town , were riddled like pepper - boxes for their pains , and public interest turned to other idols . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> crickets sang in the nights , and in the days all manner of creeping , crawling things rustled forth into the sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and that the best thing for us to do was to lay over , hal said in response to thornton s warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they , too , were silent , their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pound and a half of sun - dried salmon , which was his ration for each day , seemed to go nowhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of his feet slipped , and one man groaned aloud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the enormousness of it appalled him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man talked with manuel , and money chinked between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and truly buck was the fiend incarnate , raging at their heels and dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from his st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not check himself , but drove in upon spitz , shoulder to shoulder , so hard that he missed the throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , my frien s , he said softly ,  - mebbe it mek you mad dog , dose many bites . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> next came official orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll give you a thousand for him , sir , a thousand , sirtwelve hundred , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but mercedes interfered , crying ,  - oh , hal , you mustn t , as she caught hold of the whip and wrenched it from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perrault and franois , having cleaned out their part of the camp , hurried to save their sled - dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois , guiding the sled at the gee - pole , sometimes exchanged places with him , but not often . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hal had no fight left in him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the blood - longing became stronger than ever before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he struck out boldly , but not straight enough into the stream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> canned goods were turned out that made men laugh , for canned goods on the long trail is a thing to dream about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton commanded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one devil , dat spitz , remarked perrault . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they arrived at skaguay they were apparently on their last legs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the meantime the fire remained unbuilt , the camp half pitched , and the dogs unfed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a gust of overpowering rage swept over him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not that buck reasoned it out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men gasped and began to breathe again , unaware that for a moment they had ceased to breathe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a dainty eater , he found that his mates , finishing first , robbed him of his unfinished ration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he moaned and sobbed , it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers , and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and there was reason for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck lived at a big house in the sun - kissed santa clara valley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> among the terriers he stalked imperiously , and toots and ysabel he utterly ignored , for he was king ,king over all creeping , crawling , flying things of judge miller s place , humans included . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois was surprised , too , when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was nothing lively about it , no snap or go in him and his fellows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he openly threatened the other s leadership . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty misdemeanors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they hauled cabin logs and firewood , freighted up to the mines , and did all manner of work that horses did in the santa clara valley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rabbit could not turn , and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet , he was in full flower , at the high tide of his life , overspilling with vigor and virility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was his by right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charles sat down on a log to rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but buck turned about and started slowly on the back track . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in two days  time they dropped down the yukon bank from the barracks , loaded with letters for the outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man saved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm , but was hurled backward to the floor with buck on top of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois cried , slapping his thighs gleefully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he pleaded with his eyes to remain there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he never had enough , and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were limping and staggering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercy did not exist in the primordial life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the salient thing of this other world seemed fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was her custom to be helpless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois unfastened sol - leks s traces and put him back in his old place . </s> </s>

<s> <s> once off his feet and under that mass of huskies , there was no hope for him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> perrault grinned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively , the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end , and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the blinding day , the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hal s theory , which he practised on others , was that one must get hardened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sure , answered o brien , thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of matthewson s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he swam powerfully and was dragged ashore by pete and hans at the very point where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he linked the past with the present , and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every part , brain and body , nerve tissue and fibre , was keyed to the most exquisite pitch; and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could feel a new stir in the land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they went across divides in summer blizzards , shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows , dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies , and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the southland could boast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twice he fell over , when half up , and on the third attempt managed to rise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of this last buck was never guilty , though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man , and wagged their tails , and licked his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dog - driver held the axe poised in his hand , and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad dolly s head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but charles and hal did not know this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no withstanding him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like giants they toiled , days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he circled just beyond the range of the club , snarling with bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so as to dodge it if thrown by franois , for he was become wise in the way of clubs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was the first time buck had failed , in itself a sufficient reason to drive hal into a rage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he , alone among men , could put a pack upon buck s back in the summer travelling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and they told you true , john thornton answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a killer , a thing that preyed , living on the things that lived , unaided , alone , by virtue of his own strength and prowess , surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they need a rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he came between him and the shirks he should have punished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could , which was not in the least well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - rest be blanked , said hal , with his beardless lips; and mercedes said ,  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> regularly , each morning after he had finished his breakfast , she performed her self - appointed task , till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for thornton s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he drew him to the fire and by its light pointed them out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and further , the police had arranged in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man , and he was travelling light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was no slight task . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not know what to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three were short - haired pointers , one was a newfoundland , and the other two were mongrels of indeterminate breed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wolves swung in behind , yelping in chorus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in its frozen state it was more like strips of galvanized iron , and when a dog wrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious leathery strings and into a mass of short hair , irritating and indigestible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was continual bickering and jangling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of murmured oaths , and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did not know how to do anything , and as the days went by it became apparent that they could not learn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> joe was sourer than ever , and sol - leks was unapproachable , blind side or other side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everybody acknowledged buck a magnificent animal , but twenty fifty - pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their eyes for them to loosen their pouch - strings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what of the thin and rotten ice he had felt under his feet all day , it seemed that he sensed disaster close at hand , out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rest of the dogs were in like condition; but perrault , to make up lost time , pushed them late and early . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no fair play . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in the end buck s pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf , finding that no harm was intended , finally sniffed noses with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and dreaming there by the yukon bank , with lazy eyes blinking at the fire , these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his neck , till he whimpered low and suppressedly , or growled softly , and the half - breed cook shouted at him ,  - hey , you buck , wake up! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton was sent spinning , and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of the bar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it s the best i can do for you , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> back and forth the bull tossed his great palmated antlers , branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet within the tips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it ate away from beneath; the sun ate from above . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and break it out? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and always they pitched camp after dark , eating their bit of fish , and crawling to sleep into the snow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in pain and sorrow at the oath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nay , the tale grows worse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both , and spitz particularly , for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog , who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had never seen a dog go mad , nor did he have any reason to fear madness; yet he knew that here was horror , and fled away from it in a panic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for john thornton , he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts and to journey with his partners into the east after a fabled lost mine , the history of which was as old as the history of the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he became more morose and irritable , and when camp was pitched at once made his nest , where his driver fed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> day after day , for days unending , buck toiled in the traces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> also , the dog - driver rubbed buck s feet for half an hour each night after supper , and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took buck by the scruff of the neck , and though the dog growled threateningly , dragged him to one side and replaced sol - leks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it marked , further , the decay or going to pieces of his moral nature , a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i tich heem queek as anyt ing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - druther break cayuses any day , and twice on sundays , was the reply of the driver , as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would return and see how his own team - mates were making out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they only laughed and poked sticks at him , which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that that was what they wanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a crunch of breaking bone , and the white dog faced him on three legs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the affair was growing mysterious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he felt him grasp his tail , buck headed for the bank , swimming with all his splendid strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton was himself bruised and battered , and he went carefully over buck s body , when he had been brought around , finding three broken ribs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had crept in while buck and spitz were fighting , and when the two men sprang among them with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sick as he was , dave resented being taken out , grunting and growling while the traces were unfastened , and whimpering broken - heartedly when he saw sol - leks in the position he had held and served so long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he scraped furiously over a rock , bruised across a second , and struck a third with crushing force . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> half - stunned by the blow , buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again , while spitz soundly punished the many times offending pike . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the driver was perplexed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck did not read the newspapers , or he would have known that trouble was brewing , not alone for himself , but for every tide - water dog , strong of muscle and with warm , long hair , from puget sound to san diego . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day s travel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown , slashing buck down the shoulder and leaping clear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hunting their living meat , as the yeehats were hunting it , on the flanks of the migrating moose , the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of streams and timber and invaded buck s valley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was oppressed with a sense of calamity happening , if it were not calamity already happened; and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley toward camp , he proceeded with greater caution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this puzzled him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a simple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to make the dogs travel faster , while their own inability to get under way earlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck remembered the man in the red sweater , and retreated slowly; nor did he attempt to charge in when sol - leks was once more brought forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sprang through the sleeping camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and his cadences were their cadences , the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness , and the cold , and dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the fall of the year came on , the moose appeared in greater abundance , moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less rigorous valleys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs , and he fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was not so large ,he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds ,for his mother , shep , had been a scotch shepherd dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hans promptly snubbed with the rope , as though buck were a boat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck seized thornton s hand in his teeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was still limping slightly at the time he rescued buck , but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible lead - dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt strangely numb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was spitz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was not prone to rashness and precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him and spitz he betrayed no impatience , shunned all offensive acts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois scratched his head again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wouldn t take a sou less , so help me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> throw your weight against the gee - pole , right and left , and break it out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he flung himself upon another , and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not rob openly , but stole secretly and cunningly , out of respect for club and fang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and not only did he learn by experience , but instincts long dead became alive again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and break it out , and walk off with it for a hundred yards , john thornton said coolly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment of surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the men rode and ran by turn , and the dogs were kept on the jump , with but infrequent stoppages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dave and sol - leks , dripping blood from a score of wounds , were fighting bravely side by side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gee! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> themselves , they had covered twelve hundred miles with two days  rest , and in the nature of reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and seem  it s government money , you ain t got no kick coming , eh , perrault? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> old memories were coming upon him fast , and he was stirring to them as of old he stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his newborn cunning gave him poise and control . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day was very like another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it had snowed during the night and he was completely buried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck , because of his record , was the target for these men , and thornton was driven stoutly to defend him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dogs never stopped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a gloomy , morose fellow , and he showed curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone , and further , that there would be trouble if he were not left alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled , the dog - driver proceeded to harness the dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton s desperate struggle was fresh - written on the earth , and buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep pool . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were new dogs , utterly transformed by the harness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like his mates , he was barely able to get up , but , unlike them , he had made up his mind not to get up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> far more potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before a seeming familiarity; the instincts ( which were but the memories of his ancestors become habits ) which had lapsed in later days , and still later , in him , quickened and become alive again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> best of all , perhaps , he loved to lie near the fire , hind legs crouched under him , fore legs stretched out in front , head raised , and eyes blinking dreamily at the flames . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it bit like fire , and the next instant was gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he lay down low to the race , whining eagerly , his splendid body flashing forward , leap by leap , in the wan white moonlight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had travelled too often with the judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he dodged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the edge , head and fore feet in the water , lay skeet , faithful to the last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton s bluff , if bluff it was , had been called . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - twist it , an  you ll choke  m plentee , said manuel , and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck held on till he was on a line straight above thornton; then he turned , and with the speed of an express train headed down upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the trail they had broken into the country was packed hard by later journeyers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a mournful howl , and as buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was lost in the distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could see them , beyond spitz and to either side , half crouching for the spring , their eyes fixed upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every night , regularly , at nine , at twelve , at three , they lifted a nocturnal song , a weird and eerie chant , in which it was buck s delight to join . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here and there savage dogs rushed upon him , but he bristled his neck - hair and snarled ( for he was learning fast ) , and they let him go his way unmolested . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained momentum , he caught them up , till it was moving steadily along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank , the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward , sheltered and snug . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were awed , so still and large he stood , and a moment s pause fell , till the boldest one leaped straight for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he achieved an internal as well as external economy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> john thornton compressed his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the outside dogs , whose digestions had not been trained by chronic famine to make the most of little , had voracious appetites . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was only for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when , in addition to this , the worn - out huskies pulled weakly , hal decided that the orthodox ration was too small . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had learned the lesson , and in all his after life he never forgot it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak hell an  den heem chew dat spitz all up an  spit heem out on de snow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he knew he was at last answering the call , running by the side of his wood brother toward the place from where the call surely came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when buck and curly grew excited , half wild with fear , he raised his head as though annoyed , favored them with an incurious glance , yawned , and went to sleep again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he wormed his way forward slowly toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of them was a big , snow - white fellow from spitzbergen who had been brought away by a whaling captain , and who had later accompanied a geological survey into the barrens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from every hill slope came the trickle of running water , the music of unseen fountains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from then on it was war between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once down , that was the end of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shook himself , but more of it fell upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was afraid that thornton would pass out of his life as perrault and franois and the scotch half - breed had passed out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they sought no farther . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - t row down de club , perrault commanded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in some places , across the chest and shoulders and down the outside of the arms and thighs , it was matted into almost a thick fur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ve got a sled standing outside now , with twenty fiftypound sacks of flour on it , matthewson went on with brutal directness;  - so don t let that hinder you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercedes screamed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whips snapped , the bells tinkled merrily , the sleds churned along the trail; but buck knew , and every dog knew , what had taken place behind the belt of river trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franois sat down and scratched his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every man was tearing himself loose , even matthewson . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that settles it , he announced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> late next morning buck led the long team up the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but instead , buck s shoulder was slashed down each time as spitz leaped lightly away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men offered odds of two to one that buck could not budge the sled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shorn of its glamour and romance , arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and womanhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he knew how to take advantage of every cover , to crawl on his belly like a snake , and like a snake to leap and strike . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was spitz , treacherously attacking from the side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were simply so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a crack dog - doctor there thinks that he can cure  m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes as he crouched there , blinking dreamily at the flames , it seemed that the flames were of another fire , and that as he crouched by this other fire he saw another and different man from the half - breed cook before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he was a masterful dog , and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was no light running now , nor record time , but heavy toil each day , with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train , carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow of the pole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perrault took a hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again and again , as he looked at each brutal performance , the lesson was driven home to buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver , a master to be obeyed , though not necessarily conciliated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wot you t ink , eh , perrault? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact , nothing , no matter how remotely eatable , had escaped them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - py jingo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he staggered limply about , the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears , his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were crazed by the smell of the food . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were coated solidly with ice , and the two men kept them on the run around the fire , sweating and thawing , so close that they were singed by the flames . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last , at the end of the fourth day , he pulled the great moose down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his muzzle was the long wolf muzzle , save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his head , somewhat broader , was the wolf head on a massive scale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his only apparent ambition , like dave s , was to be left alone; though , as buck was afterward to learn , each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury , surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twice his teeth clipped together , like the steel jaws of a trap , as he backed away for better footing , with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the runners are froze fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as he had seen horses work , so he was set to work , hauling franois on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley , and returning with a load of firewood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> throw away that tent , and all those dishes ,who s going to wash them , anyway? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so it went , the inexorable elimination of the superfluous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i tell you straight , i wouldn t risk my carcass on that ice for all the gold in alaska . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an  dat buck fight lak two hells , was franois s answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the rope tightened mercilessly , while buck struggled in a fury , his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - t ree vair  good dogs , franois told perrault . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no defending it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck saw , and his mates saw , and they knew that this thing was very close to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their sacks were slim , and with his own the three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those who hurried up heard him cursing buck , and he cursed him long and fervently , and softly and lovingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for three days perrault and franois threw chests up and down the main street of skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink , while the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog - busters and mushers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the way he had learned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save chivalrous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this accomplished , the outfit , though cut in half , was still a formidable bulk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dave he was called , and he ate and slept , or yawned between times , and took interest in nothing , not even when the narwhal crossed queen charlotte sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two inches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was charles s wife and hal s sistera nice family party . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this it did , and was flying down - stream in a current as swift as a mill - race , when hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you re driving our dogs , and you do what you think best with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that night buck faced the great problem of sleeping . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> buck was glad to be gone , and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not the dead - tiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort , from which recovery is a matter of hours; but it was the dead - tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he kept franois busy , for the dog - driver was in constant apprehension of the life - and - death struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe , fearful that buck and spitz were at it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hans paid out the rope , permitting no slack , while pete kept it clear of coils . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but franois , chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice , brought his lash down upon buck with all his might . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not like to be approached on his blind side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not too cold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time he was aware that it was the club , but his madness knew no caution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercedes looked at them imploringly , untold repugnance at sight of pain written in her pretty face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry forms ,starving huskies , four or five score of them , who had scented the camp from some indian village . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the squirrels were in hiding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never in all his life had he been so vilely treated , and never in all his life had he been so angry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and this was buck s pride , too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these , added to the six of the original team , and teek and koona , the huskies obtained at the rink rapids on the record trip , brought the team up to fourteen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country , sad and silent , where wildfowl had been , but where then there was no life nor sign of lifeonly the blowing of chill winds , the forming of ice in sheltered places , and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his muscles had wasted away to knotty strings , and the flesh pads had disappeared , so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and each time the joyful bark that trembled in buck s throat was twisted into a savage growl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal , he was too wise to rebel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another time they chanced upon the time - graven wreckage of a hunting lodge , and amid the shreds of rotted blankets john thornton found a long - barrelled flint - lock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the huskies had chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you poor , poor dears , she cried sympathetically ,  - why don t you pull hard? then you wouldn t be whipped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he fell , and lay where he fell , howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried , when his eyes lit upon buck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good lord , do you think you re travelling on a pullman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> till now buck had avoided trouble with his enemy , but this was too much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man came back hurriedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dogs sprang against the breast - bands , strained hard for a few moments , then relaxed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> further , he had no thousand dollars; nor had hans or pete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he even went out of his way to bully buck , striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hair of this man was long and matted , and his head slanted back under it from the eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was no longer his body , it seemed so far away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sprang back with a snort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried mercedes , throwing up her hands in dainty dismay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the vision of the short - legged hairy man came to him more frequently , now that there was little work to be done; and often , blinking by the fire , buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and buck ran with them , side by side with the wild brother , yelping as he ran . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he followed the new scent into a thicket and found nig . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thornton shook his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> being in no haste , indian fashion , he hunted his dinner in the course of the day s travel; and if he failed to find it , like the indian , he kept on travelling , secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , matthewson said , slowly and deliberately , so that all could hear ,  - i ve got a thousand dollars that says he can t . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had seen other sleds depart over the pass for dawson , or come in from dawson , but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but each time it was the bulging face of the saloon - keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the dogs falling , mercedes weeping and riding , hal swearing innocuously , and charles s eyes wistfully watering , they staggered into john thornton s camp at the mouth of white river . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the judge s sons; he escorted mollie and alice , the judge s daughters , on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the judge s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the judge s grandsons on his back , or rolled them in the grass , and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard , and even beyond , where the paddocks were , and the berry patches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they yelped and howled under the rain of blows , but struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and that was the last of franois and perrault . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a dozen times , perrault , nosing the way broke through the ice bridges , being saved by the long pole he carried , which he so held that it fell each time across the hole made by his body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thirty mile river was comparatively coated with ice , and they covered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> john thornton was whittling the last touches on an axe - handle he had made from a stick of birch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he stooped , picked it up himself , and with two strokes cut buck s traces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a particularly fierce blow , he crawled to his feet , too dazed to rush . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he called his comrades to witness the sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the last time he rushed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the scotch half - breed slowly retraced his steps to the camp they had left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tongues of all were out and lolling , the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the team did not get up at the command . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other dog made no advances , nor received any; also , he did not attempt to steal from the newcomers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would bark and dance about in front of the bull , just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suck of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful , and thornton knew that the shore was impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> summer arrived , and dogs and men packed on their backs , rafted across blue mountain lakes , and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his whole body was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort , the muscles writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can go to hell , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it caused him to feel a vague , sweet gladness , and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i don t get the hydrophoby<s> <s>  - it ll be because you was born to hang , laughed the saloon - keeper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were alert and active , anxious that the work should go well , and fiercely irritable with whatever , by delay or confusion , retarded that work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , that could not be , else he would not have been driven out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at another time spitz went through , dragging the whole team after him up to buck , who strained backward with all his strength , his fore paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> half the load and twice the dogs , if they ever expected to reach dawson , was what was said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were savages , all of them , who knew no law but the law of club and fang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> several times thornton started , as though to speak , but changed his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true , it was a vicarious experience , else he would not have lived to profit by it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were no takers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the life of only one member was demanded , which was a remoter interest than their lives , and in the end they were content to pay the toll . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was friendly , in a treacherous sort of way , smiling into one s face the while he meditated some underhand trick , as , for instance , when he stole from buck s food at the first meal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his transient masters since he had come into the northland had bred in him a fear that no master could be permanent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a record run . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the yukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day had been long and arduous , and he slept soundly and comfortably , though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he buckled down with a will and did his best , though it was all new and strange . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once , the sled broke through , with dave and buck , and they were half - frozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shook it and grinned sheepishly at the courier , who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they were beaten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a quibble arose concerning the phrase  - break out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> later his feet grew hard to the trail , and the worn - out foot - gear was thrown away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in spite of this great love he bore john thornton , which seemed to bespeak the soft civilizing influence , the strain of the primitive , which the northland had aroused in him , remained alive and active . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the driver was surprised , too; the sled had not moved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they put a clothes - sack on the front of the sled , she suggested it should go on the back; and when they had put it on the back , and covered it over with a couple of other bundles , she discovered overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very sack , and they unloaded again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the last tie was broken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you ve got a right smart load as it is , said one of them;  - and it s not me should tell you your business , but i wouldn t tote that tent along if i was you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a band of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber , and chief among them was a great bull . </s> </s>
