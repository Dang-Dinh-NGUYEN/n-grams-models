<s> <s> as the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air , and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak , the gardener s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail , and then flew away . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then the fox said , do not shoot me , for i will give you good counsel; i know what your business is , and that you want to find the golden bird . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the son thought to himself , what can such a beast as this know about the matter?   so he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it , and it set up its tail above its back and ran into the wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should be very silly ,  said he , if i went to that shabby house , and left this charming place ; so he went into the smart house , and ate and drank at his ease , and forgot the bird , and his country too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he met the fox , who gave him the good advice: but when he came to the two inns , his eldest brother was standing at the window where the merrymaking was , and called to him to come in; and he could not withstand the temptation , but went in , and forgot the golden bird and his country in the same manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> time passed on again , and the youngest son too wished to set out into the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not listen to it for a long while , for he was very fond of his son , and was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also , and prevent his coming back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , at last it was agreed he should go , for he would not rest at home; and as he came to the wood , he met the fox , and heard the same good counsel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he was thankful to the fox , and did not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said , sit upon my tail , and you will travel faster . </s> </s>

<s> <s> in the morning came the fox again and met him as he was beginning his journey , and said , go straight forward , till you come to a castle , before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and snoring: take no notice of them , but go into the castle and pass on and on till you come to a room , where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage; close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one , otherwise you will repent it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the fox stretched out his tail again , and the young man sat himself down , and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then thought he to himself , it will be a very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage ; so he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke , and they took him prisoner and carried him before the king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will still , however , tell you how to find the golden horse , if you will do as i bid you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when the son looked at the horse , he thought it a great pity to put the leathern saddle upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will give him the good one ,  said he; i am sure he deserves it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  as he took up the golden saddle the groom awoke and cried out so loud , that all the guards ran in and took him prisoner , and in the morning he was again brought before the court to be judged , and was sentenced to die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was agreed , that , if he could bring thither the beautiful princess , he should live , and have the bird and the horse given him for his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you had , you would have carried away both the bird and the horse; yet will i once more give you counsel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go straight on , and in the evening you will arrive at a castle . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  then the fox stretched out his tail , and so away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they came to the castle , all was as the fox had said , and at twelve o clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the kiss , and she agreed to run away with him , but begged with many tears that he would let her take leave of her father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at first he refused , but she wept still more and more , and fell at his feet , till at last he consented; but the moment she came to her father s house the guards awoke and he was taken prisoner again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he was brought before the king , and the king said , you shall never have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops the view from my window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  now this hill was so big that the whole world could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days , and had done very little , the fox came and said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lie down and go to sleep; i will work for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the king was obliged to keep his word , and away went the young man and the princess; and the fox came and said to him , we will have all three , the princess , the horse , and the bird . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden horse that they are to give you , and put out your hand to take leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then lift her quickly on to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side , and gallop away as fast as you can . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> all went right: then the fox said , when you come to the castle where the bird is , i will stay with the princess at the door , and you will ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right horse , he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still , and say that you want to look at it , to see whether it is the true golden bird; and when you get it into your hand , ride away . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> this , too , happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird , the princess mounted again , and they rode on to a great wood . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  then away he went . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well ,  thought the young man , it is no hard matter to keep that advice . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> he rode on with the princess , till at last he came to the village where he had left his two brothers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and there he heard a great noise and uproar; and when he asked what was the matter , the people said , two men are going to be hanged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  as he came nearer , he saw that the two men were his brothers , who had turned robbers; so he said , cannot they in any way be saved?   but the people said no ,  unless he would bestow all his money upon the rascals and buy their liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he did not stay to think about the matter , but paid what was asked , and his brothers were given up , and went on with him towards their home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as they came to the wood where the fox first met them , it was so cool and pleasant that the two brothers said , let us sit down by the side of the river , and rest a while , to eat and drink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he said , yes ,  and forgot the fox s counsel , and sat down on the side of the river; and while he suspected nothing , they came behind , and threw him down the bank , and took the princess , the horse , and the bird , and went home to the king their master , and said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this have we won by our labour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the youngest son fell to the bottom of the river s bed: luckily it was nearly dry , but his bones were almost broken , and the bank was so steep that he could find no way to get out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the old fox came once more , and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would have befallen him: yet ,  said he , i cannot leave you here , so lay hold of my tail and hold fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he pulled him out of the river , and said to him , as he got upon the bank , your brothers have set watch to kill you , if they find you in the kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and at last he did so , and in a moment the fox was changed into a man , and turned out to be the brother of the princess , who had been lost a great many many years . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at last he said , master , my time is up; i must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages and let me go . </s> </s>

<s> <s> ah!   said hans aloud , what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all , and said , well , friend , why do you go on foot then?   ah!   said he , i have this load to carry: to be sure it is silver , but it is so heavy that i can t hold up my head , and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will give you my horse , and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  with all my heart ,  said hans: but as you are so kind to me , i must tell you one thingyou will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  however , the horseman got off , took the silver , helped hans up , gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other , and said , when you want to go very fast , smack your lips loudly together , and cry  - jip!  <s> <s> hans was delighted as he sat on the horse , drew himself up , squared his elbows , turned out his toes , cracked his whip , and rode merrily off , one minute whistling a merry tune , and another singing ,<s> <s> no care and no sorrow , a fig for the morrow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we ll laugh and be merry , sing neigh down derry!  <s> <s> after a time he thought he should like to go a little faster , so he smacked his lips and cried jip!   away went the horse full gallop; and before hans knew what he was about , he was thrown off , and lay on his back by the road - side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his horse would have ran off , if a shepherd who was coming by , driving a cow , had not stopped it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , i m off now once for all: i like your cow now a great deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick , and has spoiled my best coat , you see , in this puddle; which , by the by , smells not very like a nosegay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one can walk along at one s leisure behind that cowkeep good company , and have milk , butter , and cheese , every day , into the bargain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what would i give to have such a prize!   well ,  said the shepherd , if you are so fond of her , i will change my cow for your horse; i like to do good to my neighbours , even though i lose by it myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  done!   said hans , merrily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a noble heart that good man has!   thought he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the shepherd jumped upon the horse , wished hans and the cow good morning , and away he rode . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hans brushed his coat , wiped his face and hands , rested a while , and then drove off his cow quietly , and thought his bargain a very lucky one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i have only a piece of bread ( and i certainly shall always be able to get that ) , i can , whenever i like , eat my butter and cheese with it; and when i am thirsty i can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can i wish for more?   when he came to an inn , he halted , ate up all his bread , and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on , till at last , as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross , he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can find a cure for this ,  thought he; now i will milk my cow and quench my thirst : so he tied her to the stump of a tree , and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who would have thought that this cow , which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese , was all that time utterly dry? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hans had not thought of looking to that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was trying his luck in milking , and managing the matter very clumsily , the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hans told him what had happened , how he was dry , and wanted to milk his cow , but found the cow was dry too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i kill her , what will she be good for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if it were a pig nowlike that fat gentleman you are driving along at his easeone could do something with it; it would at any rate make sausages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  well ,  said the butcher , i don t like to say no , when one is asked to do a kind , neighbourly thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to please you i will change , and give you my fine fat pig for the cow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  heaven reward you for your kindness and self - denial!   said hans , as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel - barrow , drove it away , holding it by the string that was tied to its leg . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so on he jogged , and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes , to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the countryman stopped to ask what was o clock; this led to further chat; and hans told him all his luck , how he had so many good bargains , and how all the world went gay and smiling with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the countryman then began to tell his tale , and said he was going to take the goose to a christening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> feel ,  said he , how heavy it is , and yet it is only eight weeks old . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  meantime the countryman began to look grave , and shook his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hark ye!   said he , my worthy friend , you seem a good sort of fellow , so i can t help doing you a kind turn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your pig may get you into a scrape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the village i just came from , the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was dreadfully afraid when i saw you that you had got the squire s pig . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the least they will do will be to throw you into the horse - pond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can you swim?  <s> <s> poor hans was sadly frightened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good man ,  cried he , pray get me out of this scrape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tis not everyone would do so much for you as that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , i will not be hard upon you , as you are in trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i don t care whose pig it is , but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have much the best of the bargain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will put them into my pillow , and then i am sure i shall sleep soundly without rocking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how happy my mother will be! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> talk of a pig , indeed! </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> as he came to the next village , he saw a scissor - grinder with his wheel , working and singing ,<s> <s> o er hill and o er dale so happy i roam , work light and live well , all the world is my home; then who so blythe , so merry as i?  <s> <s> hans stood looking on for a while , and at last said , you must be well off , master grinder! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you seem so happy at your work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  yes ,  said the other , mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in itbut where did you get that beautiful goose?   i did not buy it , i gave a pig for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and where did you get the pig?   i gave a cow for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and the cow?   i gave a horse for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and the horse?   i gave a lump of silver as big as my head for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and the silver?   oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  very true: but how is that to be managed?   how? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , you must turn grinder like myself ,  said the other; you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here is one that is but little the worse for wear: i would not ask more than the value of your goose for itwill you buy?   how can you ask?   said hans; i should be the happiest man in the world , if i could have money whenever i put my hand in my pocket: what could i want more? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there s the goose . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> hans took the stone , and went his way with a light heart: his eyes sparkled for joy , and he said to himself , surely i must have been born in a lucky hour; everything i could want or wish for comes of itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> people are so kind; they seem really to think i do them a favour in letting them make me rich , and giving me good bargains . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> meantime he began to be tired , and hungry too , for he had given away his last penny in his joy at getting the cow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he could go no farther , for the stone tired him sadly: and he dragged himself to the side of a river , that he might take a drink of water , and rest a while . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy , and again fell upon his knees and thanked heaven , with tears in his eyes , for its kindness in taking away his only plague , the ugly heavy stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then up he got with a light heart , free from all his troubles , and walked on till he reached his mother s house , and told her how very easy the road to good luck was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once an old castle , that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood , and in the castle lived an old fairy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now this fairy could take any shape she pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the day long she flew about in the form of an owl , or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an old woman again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle , and all with beautiful birds in them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now there was once a maiden whose name was jorinda . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before , and a shepherd lad , whose name was jorindel , was very fond of her , and they were soon to be married . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day they went to walk in the wood , that they might be alone; and jorindel said , we must take care that we don t go too near to the fairy s castle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  it was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath , and the turtle - doves sang from the tall birches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he shrank for fear , turned pale , and trembled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jorindel turned to see the reason , and beheld his jorinda changed into a nightingale , so that her song ended with a mournful jug , jug . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an owl with fiery eyes flew three times round them , and three times screamed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone , and could neither weep , nor speak , nor stir hand or foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre , with staring eyes , and a nose and chin that almost met one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she mumbled something to herself , seized the nightingale , and went away with it in her hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor jorindel saw the nightingale was gonebut what could he do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not speak , he could not move from the spot where he stood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on a sudden jorindel found himself free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he fell on his knees before the fairy , and prayed her to give him back his dear jorinda: but she laughed at him , and said he should never see her again; then she went her way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he prayed , he wept , he sorrowed , but all in vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas!   he said , what will become of me?   he could not go back to his own home , so he went to a strange village , and employed himself in keeping sheep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he plucked the flower , and set out and travelled day and night , till he came again to the castle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he touched the door with the flower , and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court , and listened when he heard so many birds singing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he came to the chamber where the fairy sat , with the seven hundred birds singing in the seven hundred cages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he looked around at the birds , but alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was thinking what to do , he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages , and was making the best of her way off through the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he ran or flew after her , touched the cage with the flower , and jorinda stood before him , and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever , as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he touched all the other birds with the flower , so that they all took their old forms again; and he took jorinda home , where they were married , and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many other lads , whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy s cages by themselves , much longer than they liked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him a great many years , but was now growing old and every day more and more unfit for work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his master therefore was tired of keeping him and began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass , who saw that some mischief was in the wind , took himself slyly off , and began his journey towards the great city , for there ,  thought he , i may turn musician . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what makes you pant so , my friend?   said the ass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas!   said the dog , my master was going to knock me on the head , because i am old and weak , and can no longer make myself useful to him in hunting; so i ran away; but what can i do to earn my livelihood?   hark ye!   said the ass , i am going to the great city to turn musician: suppose you go with me , and try what you can do in the same way?   the dog said he was willing , and they jogged on together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the road and making a most rueful face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray , my good lady ,  said the ass , what s the matter with you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you look quite out of spirits!   ah , me!   said the cat , how can one be in good spirits when one s life is in danger? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  oh ,  said the ass , by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night singer , and may make your fortune as a musician . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the cat was pleased with the thought , and joined the party . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon afterwards , as they were passing by a farmyard , they saw a cock perched upon a gate , and screaming out with all his might and main . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , who knows? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  with all my heart ,  said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they could not , however , reach the great city the first day; so when night came on , they went into a wood to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ass and the dog laid themselves down under a great tree , and the cat climbed up into the branches; while the cock , thinking that the higher he sat the safer he should be , flew up to the very top of the tree , and then , according to his custom , before he went to sleep , looked out on all sides of him to see that everything was well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in doing this , he saw afar off something bright and shining and calling to his companions said , there must be a house no great way off , for i see a light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  if that be the case ,  said the ass , we had better change our quarters , for our lodging is not the best in the world!   besides ,  added the dog , i should not be the worse for a bone or two , or a bit of meat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ass , being the tallest of the company , marched up to the window and peeped in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , i see a table spread with all kinds of good things , and robbers sitting round it making merry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that would be a noble lodging for us ,  said the cock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes ,  said the ass , if we could only get in ; so they consulted together how they should contrive to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ass placed himself upright on his hind legs , with his forefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog s shoulders , and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat s head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ass brayed , the dog barked , the cat mewed , and the cock screamed; and then they all broke through the window at once , and came tumbling into the room , amongst the broken glass , with a most hideous clatter! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in the yard , the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door , the cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes , and the cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and , as they were all rather tired with their journey , they soon fell asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but about midnight , when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were out and that all seemed quiet , they began to think that they had been in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them , who was bolder than the rest , went to see what was going on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> finding everything still , he marched into the kitchen , and groped about till he found a match in order to light a candle; and then , espying the glittering fiery eyes of the cat , he mistook them for live coals , and held the match to them to light it . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  but what can we do with him?   said the shepherd , he has not a tooth in his head , and the thieves don t care for him at all; to be sure he has served us , but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day , depend upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your master , you know , goes out every morning very early with his wife into the field; and they take their little child with them , and lay it down behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the shepherd patted him on the head , and said , old sultan has saved our child from the wolf , and therefore he shall live and be well taken care of , and have plenty to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wife , go home , and give him a good dinner , and let him have my old cushion to sleep on as long as he lives . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so from this time forward sultan had all that he could wish for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy , and said , now , my good fellow , you must tell no tales , but turn your head the other way when i want to taste one of the old shepherd s fine fat sheep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  no ,  said the sultan; i will be true to my master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  however , the wolf thought he was in joke , and came one night to get a dainty morsel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait for him behind the barn door , and when the wolf was busy looking out for a good fat sheep , he had a stout cudgel laid about his back , that combed his locks for him finely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the wolf was very angry , and called sultan an old rogue ,  and swore he would have his revenge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd s old three - legged cat; so he took her with him , and as the poor thing limped along with some trouble , she stuck up her tail straight in the air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sultan and the cat soon came up , and looked about and wondered that no one was there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they looked up , and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal , and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of himself , and had promised to be good friends again with old sultan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a village dwelt a poor old woman , who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she was emptying the beans into the pan , one dropped without her observing it , and lay on the ground beside a straw , and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the straw began and said: dear friends , from whence do you come here?   the coal replied: i fortunately sprang out of the fire , and if i had not escaped by sheer force , my death would have been certain ,i should have been burnt to ashes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the bean said: i too have escaped with a whole skin , but if the old woman had got me into the pan , i should have been made into broth without any mercy , like my comrades . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and would a better fate have fallen to my lot?   said the straw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once , and took their lives . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i luckily slipped through her fingers . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the proposition pleased the two others , and they set out on their way together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon , however , they came to a little brook , and as there was no bridge or foot - plank , they did not know how they were to get over it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the straw hit on a good idea , and said: i will lay myself straight across , and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other , and the coal , who was of an impetuous disposition , tripped quite boldly on to the newly - built bridge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when she had reached the middle , and heard the water rushing beneath her , she was after all , afraid , and stood still , and ventured no farther . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the straw , however , began to burn , broke in two pieces , and fell into the stream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bean thanked him most prettily , but as the tailor used black thread , all beans since then have a black seam . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off , where there were in those days fairies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now this king and queen had plenty of money , and plenty of fine clothes to wear , and plenty of good things to eat and drink , and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had been married many years they had no children , and this grieved them very much indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl , so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy , and said he would hold a great feast and make merry , and show the child to all the land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the queen said , i will have the fairies also , that they might be kind and good to our little daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one gave her goodness , another beauty , another riches , and so on till she had all that was good in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just as eleven of them had done blessing her , a great noise was heard in the courtyard , and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was come , with a black cap on her head , and black shoes on her feet , and a broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining - hall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry , and scolded the king and queen very much , and set to work to take her revenge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she cried out , the king s daughter shall , in her fifteenth year , be wounded by a spindle , and fall down dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and burnt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but all the gifts of the first eleven fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so beautiful , and well behaved , and good , and wise , that everyone who knew her loved her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened that , on the very day she was fifteen years old , the king and queen were not at home , and she was left alone in the palace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she roved about by herself , and looked at all the rooms and chambers , till at last she came to an old tower , to which there was a narrow staircase ending with a little door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the door there was a golden key , and when she turned it the door sprang open , and there sat an old lady spinning away very busily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , how now , good mother ,  said the princess; what are you doing there?   spinning ,  said the old lady , and nodded her head , humming a tune , while buzz! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> went the wheel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how prettily that little thing turns round!   said the princess , and took the spindle and began to try and spin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , she was not dead , but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the king and the queen , who had just come home , and all their court , fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables , and the dogs in the court , the pigeons on the house - top , and the very flies slept upon the walls . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace , and every year it became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded and hidden , so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping briar rose ( for so the king s daughter was called ): so that , from time to time , several kings  sons came , and tried to break through the thicket into the palace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he told , too , how he had heard from his grandfather that many , many princes had come , and had tried to break through the thicket , but that they had all stuck fast in it , and died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the old man tried to hinder him , but he was bent upon going . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs , through which he went with ease , and they shut in after him as thick as ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he came at last to the palace , and there in the court lay the dogs asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat the pigeons fast asleep , with their heads under their wings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when he came into the palace , the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips , going to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand , as if she was going to beat the boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went on still farther , and all was so still that he could hear every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower , and opened the door of the little room in which briar rose was; and there she lay , fast asleep on a couch by the window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke , and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke , and all the court , and gazed on each other with great wonder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the horses shook themselves , and the dogs jumped up and barked; the pigeons took their heads from under their wings , and looked about and flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack , and round went the spit , with the goose for the king s dinner upon it; the butler finished his draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box on his ear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a shepherd s dog had a master who took no care of him , but often let him suffer the greatest hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels , and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the road he met a sparrow that said to him , why are you so sad , my friend?   because ,  said the dog , i am very very hungry , and have nothing to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  if that be all ,  answered the sparrow , come with me into the next town , and i will soon find you plenty of food . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so on they went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher s shop , the sparrow said to the dog , stand there a little while till i peck you down a piece of meat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her , she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf , till at last down it fell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the dog snapped it up , and scrambled away with it into a corner , where he soon ate it all up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well ,  said the sparrow , you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to the next shop , and i will peck you down another steak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the dog had eaten this too , the sparrow said to him , well , my good friend , have you had enough now?   i have had plenty of meat ,  answered he , but i should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  come with me then ,  said the sparrow , and you shall soon have that too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she took him to a baker s shop , and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window , till they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more , she took him to another shop and pecked down some more for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when that was eaten , the sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes ,  said he; and now let us take a walk a little way out of the town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they both went out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm , they had not gone far before the dog said , i am very much tiredi should like to take a nap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the dog stretched himself out on the road , and fell fast asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sparrow , seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way , but would go on in the track in which the dog lay , so as to drive over him , called out , stop! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stop! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the carter , grumbling to himself , you make it the worse for me , indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now mind what i say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  do your worst , and welcome ,  said the brute , what harm can you do me?   and passed on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart , and pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then all the wine ran out , without the carter seeing it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he looked round , and saw that the cart was dripping , and the cask quite empty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what an unlucky wretch i am!   cried he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not wretch enough yet!   said the sparrow , as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses , and pecked at him till he reared up and kicked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not wretch enough yet!   said the sparrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as the carter went on with the other two horses , she again crept under the tilt of the cart , and pecked out the bung of the second cask , so that all the wine ran out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the carter saw this , he again cried out , miserable wretch that i am!   but the sparrow answered , not wretch enough yet!   and perched on the head of the second horse , and pecked at him too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not wretch enough yet!   said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse , she began to peck him too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miserable wretch that i am!   cried he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not wretch enough yet!   answered the sparrow as she flew away; now will i plague and punish thee at thy own house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him , and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> husband ,  replied she , and a wicked bird has come into the house , and has brought with her all the birds in the world , i am sure , and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft , and are eating it up at such a rate!   away ran the husband upstairs , and saw thousands of birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn , with the sparrow in the midst of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not wretch enough yet!   said the sparrow; thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!   and away she flew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had , went down into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done , but sat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sparrow now hopped in , perched upon the window - seat , and cried , carter! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it shall cost thee thy life!   then he became mad and blind with rage , and struck the window - seat with such force that he cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place , the carter and his wife were so furious , that they broke all their furniture , glasses , chairs , benches , the table , and at last the walls , without touching the bird at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the end , however , they caught her: and the wife said , shall i kill her at once?   no ,  cried he , that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; i will eat her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it shall cost thee thy life yet!   with that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet , and cried , wife , strike at the bird and kill her in my hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and the wife struck; but she missed her aim , and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead , and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they slept in twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed , the doors were shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody could find out how it happened , or where they had been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the king made it known to all the land , that if any person could discover the secret , and find out where it was that the princesses danced in the night , he should have the one he liked best for his wife , and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not succeed , after three days and nights , should be put to death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was well entertained , and in the evening was taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after him came several others; but they had all the same luck , and all lost their lives in the same manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now it chanced that an old soldier , who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer , passed through the country where this king reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood , he met an old woman , who asked him where he was going . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hardly know where i am going , or what i had better do ,  said the soldier; but i think i should like very well to find out where it is that the princesses dance , and then in time i might be a king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  well ,  said the old dame , that is no very hard task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves you pretend to be fast asleep . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then she gave him a cloak , and said , as soon as you put that on you will become invisible , and you will then be able to follow the princesses wherever they go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the soldier heard all this good counsel , he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king , and said he was willing to undertake the task . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was as well received as the others had been , and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the outer chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just as he was going to lie down , the eldest of the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all away secretly , taking care not to drink a drop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  you simpleton ,  said the eldest , you are always afraid; have you forgotten how many kings  sons have already watched in vain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as for this soldier , even if i had not given him his sleeping draught , he would have slept soundly enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the soldier saw them going down through the trap - door one after another , the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose , he jumped up , put on the cloak which the old woman had given him , and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess , and she cried out to her sisters , all is not right; someone took hold of my gown . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then down they all went , and at the bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and the leaves were all of silver , and glittered and sparkled beautifully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke off a little branch , and there came a loud noise from the tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the youngest daughter said again , i am sure all is not rightdid not you hear that noise? </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then they came to another grove of trees , where all the leaves were of gold; and afterwards to a third , where the leaves were all glittering diamonds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise , which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but the eldest still said , it was only the princes , who were crying for joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them , who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they were rowing over the lake , the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said , i do not know why it is , but though i am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual , and i am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  it is only the heat of the weather ,  said the princess: i feel it very warm too . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> on the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle , from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there they all landed , and went into the castle , and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier , who was all the time invisible , danced with them too; and when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her , he drank it all up , so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this , too , the youngest sister was terribly frightened , but the eldest always silenced her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they danced on till three o clock in the morning , and then all their shoes were worn out , so that they were obliged to leave off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the princes rowed them back again over the lake ( but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess ); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other , the princesses promising to come again the next night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they came to the stairs , the soldier ran on before the princesses , and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very much tired , they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said , now all is quite safe ; then they undressed themselves , put away their fine clothes , pulled off their shoes , and went to bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened , but determined to see more of this strange adventure , and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces , and then returned home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret , he was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when the king asked him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where do my twelve daughters dance at night?   he answered , with twelve princes in a castle under ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and then he told the king all that had happened , and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the king asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he answered , i am not very young , so i will have the eldest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and they were married that very day , and the soldier was chosen to be the king s heir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty , close by the seaside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fisherman used to go out all day long a - fishing; and one day , as he sat on the shore with his rod , looking at the sparkling waves and watching his line , all on a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the fish said , pray let me live! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not a real fish; i am an enchanted prince: put me in the water again , and let me go!   oh , ho!   said the man , you need not make so many words about the matter; i will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away , sir , as soon as you please!   then he put him back into the water , and the fish darted straight down to the bottom , and left a long streak of blood behind him on the wave . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the fisherman did not much like the business: however , he went to the seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and green . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the fish came swimming to him , and said , well , what is her will? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what does your wife want?   ah!   said the fisherman , she says that when i had caught you , i ought to have asked you for something before i let you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty , and wants a snug little cottage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah!   said the fisherman , how happily we shall live now!   we will try to do so , at least ,  said his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , what does she want now?   said the fish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  go home , then ,  said the fish; she is standing at the gate of it already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well ,  said the man , now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  perhaps we may ,  said the wife; but let us sleep upon it , before we make up our minds to that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they went to bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning when dame ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight , and she jogged the fisherman with her elbow , and said , get up , husband , and bestir yourself , for we must be king of all the land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , wife ,  said the fisherman , how can you be kingthe fish cannot make you a king?   husband ,  said she , say no more about it , but go and try! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , what would she have now?   said the fish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas!   said the poor man , my wife wants to be king . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw a troop of soldiers , and heard the sound of drums and trumpets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds , with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six fair maidens , each a head taller than the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and when he had looked at her for a long time , he said , ah , wife! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a fine thing it is to be king! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why should you wish to be emperor?   said the fisherman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say i will be emperor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  ah , wife!   replied the fisherman , the fish cannot make an emperor , i am sure , and i should not like to ask him for such a thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i am king ,  said ilsabill , and you are my slave; so go at once!  <s> <s> so the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along , this will come to no good , it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last , and then we shall be sorry for what we have done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what would she have now?   said the fish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  go home ,  said the fish; she is emperor already . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> so he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold , with a great crown on her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards and attendants in a row , each one smaller than the other , from the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and before her stood princes , and dukes , and earls: and the fisherman went up to her and said , wife , are you emperor?   yes ,  said she , i am emperor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will be pope next . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  husband ,  said she , i will be pope this very day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what nonsense!   said she; if he can make an emperor , he can make a pope: go and try him . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> so the fisherman went . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when he came to the shore the wind was raging and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves , and the ships were in trouble , and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky , but towards the south all was red , as if a dreadful storm was rising . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened , and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what does she want now?   said the fish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah!   said the fisherman , my wife wants to be pope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  go home ,  said the fish; she is pope already . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then the fisherman went home , and found ilsabill sitting on a throne that was two miles high . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she had three great crowns on her head , and around her stood all the pomp and power of the church . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  well , wife ,  replied he , it is a grand thing to be pope; and now you must be easy , for you can be nothing greater . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i will think about that ,  said the wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they went to bed: but dame ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should be next . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last , as she was dropping asleep , morning broke , and the sun rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha!   thought she , as she woke up and looked at it through the window , after all i cannot prevent the sun rising . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the fisherman was half asleep , but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas , wife!   said he , cannot you be easy with being pope?   no ,  said she , i am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my leave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and all the heavens became black with stormy clouds , and the lightnings played , and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in the sea great black waves , swelling up like mountains with crowns of white foam upon their heads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what does she want now?   said the fish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  go home ,  said the fish , to your pigsty again . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> and there they live to this very day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once in summer - time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest , and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: brother wolf , what bird is it that sings so well?   that is the king of birds ,  said the wolf , before whom we must bow down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  in reality the bird was the willow - wren . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bear , however , could not rest until he had seen the royal palace , and when a short time had passed , went to it again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our parents are honest people! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bear , you will have to pay for that!  <s> <s> the bear and the wolf grew uneasy , and turned back and went into their holes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you shall suffer for itwe will punish you by a bloody war . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  thus war was announced to the bear , and all four - footed animals were summoned to take part in it , oxen , asses , cows , deer , and every other animal the earth contained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the willow - wren summoned everything which flew in the air , not only birds , large and small , but midges , and hornets , bees and flies had to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the time came for the war to begin , the willow - wren sent out spies to discover who was the enemy s commander - in - chief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gnat , who was the most crafty , flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled , and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be announced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there stood the bear , and he called the fox before him and said: fox , you are the most cunning of all animals , you shall be general and lead us . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then the king and queen flew home to their children and cried: children , rejoice , eat and drink to your heart s content , we have won the battle!   but the young wrens said: we will not eat yet , the bear must come to the nest , and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable children , before we will do that . </s> </s>

<s> <s> one fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs , and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water , that rose in the midst of it , she sat herself down to rest a while . </s> </s>

<s> <s> there is a nasty frog ,  said she , at the door , that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: i told him that he should live with me here , thinking that he could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door , and he wants to come in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the king said to the young princess , as you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray lift me upon chair ,  said he to the princess , and let me sit next to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  as soon as she had done this , the frog said , put your plate nearer to me , that i may eat out of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  this she did , and when he had eaten as much as he could , he said , now i am tired; carry me upstairs , and put me into your bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and the princess , though very unwilling , took him up in her hand , and put him upon the pillow of her own bed , where he slept all night long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as it was light he jumped up , hopped downstairs , and went out of the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the third night he did the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy , who had changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some princess should take him out of the spring , and let him eat from her plate , and sleep upon her bed for three nights . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you ,  said the prince , have broken his cruel charm , and now i have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father s kingdom , where i will marry you , and love you as long as you live . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the young princess , you may be sure , was not long in saying yes  to all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up , with eight beautiful horses , decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach rode the prince s servant , faithful heinrich , who had bewailed the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so bitterly , that his heart had well - nigh burst . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  the good mouse consented , but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church , and devoured half the pot of fat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself ,  said she , and was quite satisfied with her day s work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she went home the mouse inquired: and what was the child christened?   half - done ,  answered the cat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never heard the name in my life , i ll wager anything it is not in the calendar!  <s> <s> the cat s mouth soon began to water for some more licking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the child is quite black , only it has white paws , but with that exception , it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only happens once every few years , you will let me go , won t you?   top - off! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> half - done!   answered the mouse , they are such odd names , they make me very thoughtful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  you sit at home ,  said the cat , in your dark - grey fur coat and long tail , and are filled with fancies , that s because you do not go out in the daytime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when everything is eaten up one has some peace ,  said she to herself , and well filled and fat she did not return home till night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i have never seen it in print . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all - gone; what can that mean?   and she shook her head , curled herself up , and lay down to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother , but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside , the mouse thought of their provision , and said: come , cat , we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselveswe shall enjoy that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  yes ,  answered the cat , you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the king of a great land died , and left his queen to take care of their only child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this child was a daughter , who was very beautiful; and her mother loved her dearly , and was very kind to her . </s> </s>

<s> <s> now the princess s horse was the fairy s gift , and it was called falada , and could speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the time came for them to set out , the fairy went into her bed - chamber , and took a little knife , and cut off a lock of her hair , and gave it to the princess , and said , take care of it , dear child; for it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then they all took a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into her bosom , got upon her horse , and set off on her journey to her bridegroom s kingdom . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  nay ,  said the maid , if you are thirsty , get off yourself , and stoop down by the water and drink; i shall not be your waiting - maid any longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she was so thirsty that she got down , and knelt over the little brook , and drank; for she was frightened , and dared not bring out her golden cup; and she wept and said , alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what will become of me?   and the lock answered her , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the princess was very gentle and meek , so she said nothing to her maid s ill behaviour , but got upon her horse again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the maid answered her , and even spoke more haughtily than before: drink if you will , but i shall not be your waiting - maid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse , and lay down , and held her head over the running stream , and cried and said , what will become of me?   and the lock of hair answered her again: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as she leaned down to drink , the lock of hair fell from her bosom , and floated away with the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now she was so frightened that she did not see it; but her maid saw it , and was very glad , for she knew the charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power , now that she had lost the hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last , as they drew near the end of their journey , this treacherous servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the waiting - maid got upon falada , and the real bride rode upon the other horse , and they went on in this way till at last they came to the royal court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window , looking at what was going on; and he saw her in the courtyard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she looked very pretty , and too delicate for a waiting - maid , he went up into the royal chamber to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her , that was thus left standing in the court below . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i brought her with me for the sake of her company on the road ,  said she; pray give the girl some work to do , that she may not be idle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the old king could not for some time think of any work for her to do; but at last he said , i have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may go and help him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  now the name of this lad , that the real bride was to help in watching the king s geese , was curdken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the false bride said to the prince , dear husband , pray do me one piece of kindness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then tell one of your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse i rode upon , for it was very unruly , and plagued me sadly on the road ; but the truth was , she was very much afraid lest falada should some day or other speak , and tell all she had done to the princess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she carried her point , and the faithful falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it , she wept , and begged the man to nail up falada s head against a large dark gate of the city , through which she had to pass every morning and evening , that there she might still see him sometimes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head , and nailed it up under the dark gate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when she came to the meadow , she sat down upon a bank there , and let down her waving locks of hair , which were all of pure silver; and when curdken saw it glitter in the sun , he ran up , and would have pulled some of the locks out , but she cried: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then there came a wind , so strong that it blew off curdken s hat; and away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after it; till , by the time he came back , she had done combing and curling her hair , and had put it up again safe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he was very angry and sulky , and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it grew dark in the evening , and then drove them homewards . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and the head answered: </s> </s>

<s> <s> then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way , over the hills and far away , so that he had to run after it; and when he came back she had bound up her hair again , and all was safe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the evening , after they came home , curdken went to the old king , and said , i cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> because , instead of doing any good , she does nothing but tease me all day long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and curdken said , when we go in the morning through the dark gate with our flock of geese , she cries and talks with the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall , and says: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the head answers: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning came , he placed himself behind the dark gate , and heard how she spoke to falada , and how falada answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went into the field , and hid himself in a bush by the meadow s side; and he soon saw with his own eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how , after a little time , she let down her hair that glittered in the sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then he heard her say: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and soon came a gale of wind , and carried away curdken s hat , and away went curdken after it , while the girl went on combing and curling her hair . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> but the old king begged so hard , that she had no peace till she had told him all the tale , from beginning to end , word for word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he called his son and told him that he had only a false bride; for that she was merely a waiting - maid , while the true bride stood by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty , and heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to the false bride , the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all his court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he began , and told all the story of the princess , as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the true waiting - maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would behave thus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  thou art she!   said the old king; and as thou has judged thyself , so shall it be done to thee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how they went to the mountains to eat nuts<s> <s> the nuts are quite ripe now ,  said chanticleer to his wife partlet , suppose we go together to the mountains , and eat as many as we can , before the squirrel takes them all away . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> so they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day , they stayed there till the evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , whether it was that they had eaten so many nuts that they could not walk , or whether they were lazy and would not , i do not know: however , they took it into their heads that it did not become them to go home on foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so chanticleer began to build a little carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished , partlet jumped into it and sat down , and bid chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  while this was passing , a duck came quacking up and cried out , you thieving vagabonds , what business have you in my grounds? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ll give it you well for your insolence!   and upon that she fell upon chanticleer most lustily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this she agreed to do; and chanticleer got upon the box , and drove , crying , now , duck , get on as fast as you can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after they had travelled along a little way , they met a needle and a pin walking together along the road: and the needle cried out , stop , stop!   and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way , and such dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his friend , the pin , had been at a public - house a few miles off , and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , the duck , who slept in the open air in the yard , heard them coming , and jumping into the brook which ran close by the inn , soon swam out of their reach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an hour or two afterwards the landlord got up , and took his handkerchief to wipe his face , but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire , but when he stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes , and almost blinded him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bless me!   said he , all the world seems to have a design against my head this morning : and so saying , he threw himself sulkily into his easy chair; but , oh dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the needle ran into him; and this time the pain was not in his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he now flew into a very great passion , and , suspecting the company who had come in the night before , he went to look after them , but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds , who ate a great deal , paid no reckoning , and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how chanticleer and partlet went to visit mr korbes<s> <s> another day , chanticleer and partlet wished to ride out together; so chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels , and harnessed six mice to it; and then he and partlet got into the carriage , and away they drove . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they arrived at mr korbes s house , he was not at home; so the mice drew the carriage into the coach - house , chanticleer and partlet flew upon a beam , the cat sat down in the fireplace , the duck got into the washing cistern , the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow , the millstone laid himself over the house door , and the egg rolled himself up in the towel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when mr korbes came home , he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and when he tried to wipe himself , the egg broke to pieces in the towel all over his face and eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 3 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how partlet died and was buried , and how chanticleer died of grief<s> <s> another day chanticleer and partlet agreed to go again to the mountains to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found should be shared equally between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now partlet found a very large nut; but she said nothing about it to chanticleer , and kept it all to herself: however , it was so big that she could not swallow it , and it stuck in her throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river , and said , river , give me some water , for partlet lies in the mountain , and will be choked by a great nut . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the river said , run first to the bride , and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  chanticleer ran to the bride , and said , bride , you must give me a silken cord , for then the river will give me water , and the water i will carry to partlet , who lies on the mountain , and will be choked by a great nut . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the bride said , run first , and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow in the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then chanticleer ran to the garden , and took the garland from the bough where it hung , and brought it to the bride; and then the bride gave him the silken cord , and he took the silken cord to the river , and the river gave him water , and he carried the water to partlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut , and lay quite dead , and never moved any more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then chanticleer was very sorry , and cried bitterly; and all the beasts came and wept with him over poor partlet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and six mice built a little hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed themselves before it , and chanticleer drove them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the way they met the fox . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where are you going , chanticleer?   said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to bury my partlet ,  said the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> may i go with you?   said the fox . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes; but you must get up behind , or my horses will not be able to draw you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf , the bear , the goat , and all the beasts of the wood , came and climbed upon the hearse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so on they went till they came to a rapid stream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how shall we get over?   said chanticleer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then said a straw , i will lay myself across , and you may pass over upon me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but as the mice were going over , the straw slipped away and fell into the water , and the six mice all fell in and were drowned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then a large log of wood came and said , i am big enough; i will lay myself across the stream , and you shall pass over upon me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he laid himself down; but they managed so clumsily , that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the stream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then a stone , who saw what had happened , came up and kindly offered to help poor chanticleer by laying himself across the stream; and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse , and managed to get partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners , who were sitting behind , were too heavy , and fell back into the water and were all carried away by the stream and drowned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus chanticleer was left alone with his dead partlet; and having dug a grave for her , he laid her in it , and made a little hillock over her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he sat down by the grave , and wept and mourned , till at last he died too; and so all were dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was , however , surrounded by a high wall , and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress , who had great power and was dreaded by all the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden , when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion ( rapunzel ) , and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it , she quite pined away , and began to look pale and miserable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then her husband was alarmed , and asked: what ails you , dear wife?   ah ,  she replied , if i can t eat some of the rampion , which is in the garden behind our house , i shall die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the man , who loved her , thought: sooner than let your wife die , bring her some of the rampion yourself , let it cost what it will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she at once made herself a salad of it , and ate it greedily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it tasted so good to herso very good , that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the gloom of evening therefore , he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid , for he saw the enchantress standing before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can you dare ,  said she with angry look , descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you shall suffer for it!   ah ,  answered he , let mercy take the place of justice , i only made up my mind to do it out of necessity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my wife saw your rampion from the window , and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened , and said to him: if the case be as you say , i will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will , only i make one condition , you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated , and i will care for it like a mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the enchantress wanted to go in , she placed herself beneath it and cried: </s> </s>

<s> <s> then rapunzel lost her fear , and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband , and she saw that he was young and handsome , she thought: he will love me more than old dame gothel does ; and she said yes , and laid her hand in his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she said: i will willingly go away with you , but i do not know how to get down . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i thought i had separated you from all the world , and yet you have deceived me!   in her anger she clutched rapunzel s beautiful tresses , wrapped them twice round her left hand , seized a pair of scissors with the right , and snip , snap , they were cut off , and the lovely braids lay on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the same day that she cast out rapunzel , however , the enchantress fastened the braids of hair , which she had cut off , to the hook of the window , and when the king s son came and cried: </s> </s>

<s> <s> the king s son ascended , but instead of finding his dearest rapunzel , he found the enchantress , who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> aha!   she cried mockingly , you would fetch your dearest , but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it , and will scratch out your eyes as well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the king s son was beside himself with pain , and in his despair he leapt down from the tower . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he escaped with his life , but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus he roamed about in misery for some years , and at length came to the desert where rapunzel , with the twins to which she had given birth , a boy and a girl , lived in wretchedness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he heard a voice , and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it , and when he approached , rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt , and as he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he followed the sound , and at last came to a high tree , and at the top of this a little child was sitting , for the mother had fallen asleep under the tree with the child , and a bird of prey had seen it in her arms , had flown down , snatched it away , and set it on the high tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the forester climbed up , brought the child down , and thought to himself: you will take him home with you , and bring him up with your lina . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he took it home , therefore , and the two children grew up together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the one , which he had found on a tree was called fundevogel , because a bird had carried it away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fundevogel and lina loved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they were sad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now the forester had an old cook , who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water , and did not go once only , but many times , out to the spring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so lina said , no , she would never repeat it to anyone , and then the cook said: early tomorrow morning , when the forester is out hunting , i will heat the water , and when it is boiling in the kettle , i will throw in fundevogel , and will boil him in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then lina said to fundevogel: if you will never leave me , i too will never leave you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then said lina: then will i tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> last night , old sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that i asked her why she was doing that , and she said that if i would promise not to tell anyone , and she said that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting , she would set the kettle full of water , throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up quickly , dress ourselves , and go away together . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the two children therefore got up , dressed themselves quickly , and went away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the water in the kettle was boiling , the cook went into the bedroom to fetch fundevogel and throw him into it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when she came in , and went to the beds , both the children were gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she was terribly alarmed , and she said to herself: what shall i say now when the forester comes home and sees that the children are gone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they must be followed instantly to get them back again . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then the cook sent three servants after them , who were to run and overtake the children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the children , however , were sitting outside the forest , and when they saw from afar the three servants running , lina said to fundevogel: never leave me , and i will never leave you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then said lina: do you become a rose - tree , and i the rose upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the three servants came to the forest , nothing was there but a rose - tree and one rose on it , but the children were nowhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then said they: there is nothing to be done here ,  and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing in the forest but a little rose - bush with one rose on it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the old cook scolded and said: you simpletons , you should have cut the rose - bush in two , and have broken off the rose and brought it home with you; go , and do it at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  they had therefore to go out and look for the second time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the children , however , saw them coming from a distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  fundevogel said: neither now; nor ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  said lina: then do you become a church , and i ll be the chandelier in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so when the three servants came , nothing was there but a church , with a chandelier in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they said therefore to each other: what can we do here , let us go home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when they got home , the cook asked if they had not found them; so they said no , they had found nothing but a church , and there was a chandelier in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the cook scolded them and said: you fools! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the children , however , saw from afar that the three servants were coming , and the cook waddling after them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then said lina: fundevogel , never leave me , and i will never leave you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then said fundevogel: neither now , nor ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  said lina: be a fishpond , and i will be the duck upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the cook , however , came up to them , and when she saw the pond she lay down by it , and was about to drink it up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the children went home together , and were heartily delighted , and if they have not died , they are living still . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then came a peasant woman down the street crying: good jams , cheap! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good jams , cheap!   this rang pleasantly in the tailor s ears; he stretched his delicate head out of the window , and called: come up here , dear woman; here you will get rid of your goods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the woman came up the three steps to the tailor with her heavy basket , and he made her unpack all the pots for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he inspected each one , lifted it up , put his nose to it , and at length said: the jam seems to me to be good , so weigh me out four ounces , dear woman , and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no consequence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the woman who had hoped to find a good sale , gave him what he desired , but went away quite angry and grumbling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this won t taste bitter ,  said he , but i will just finish the jacket before i take a bite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he laid the bread near him , sewed on , and in his joy , made bigger and bigger stitches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the flies , however , who understood no german , would not be turned away , but came back again in ever - increasing companies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little tailor at last lost all patience , and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work - table , and saying: wait , and i will give it to you ,  struck it mercilessly on them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he drew it away and counted , there lay before him no fewer than seven , dead and with legs stretched out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole town shall know of this!   and the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle , stitched it , and embroidered on it in large letters: seven at one stroke!   what , the town!   he continued , the whole world shall hear of it!   and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb s tail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tailor put on the girdle , and resolved to go forth into the world , because he thought his workshop was too small for his valour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before he went away , he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could take with him; however , he found nothing but an old cheese , and that he put in his pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in front of the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now he took to the road boldly , and as he was light and nimble , he felt no fatigue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am just on my way thither , and want to try my luck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you miserable creature!  <s> <s> oh , indeed?   answered the little tailor , and unbuttoned his coat , and showed the giant the girdle , there may you read what kind of a man i am!   the giant read: seven at one stroke ,  and thought that they had been men whom the tailor had killed , and began to feel a little respect for the tiny fellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless , he wished to try him first , and took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  is that all?   said the tailor , that is child s play with us!   and put his hand into his pocket , brought out the soft cheese , and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faith ,  said he , that was a little better , wasn t it?   the giant did not know what to say , and could not believe it of the little man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , little mite of a man , do that likewise ,  well thrown ,  said the tailor , but after all the stone came down to earth again; i will throw you one which shall never come back at all ,  and he put his hand into his pocket , took out the bird , and threw it into the air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bird , delighted with its liberty , rose , flew away and did not come back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how does that shot please you , comrade?   asked the tailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  readily ,  answered the little man; take you the trunk on your shoulders , and i will raise up the branches and twigs; after all , they are the heaviest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the giant took the trunk on his shoulder , but the tailor seated himself on a branch , and the giant , who could not look round , had to carry away the whole tree , and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind , was quite merry and happy , and whistled the song: three tailors rode forth from the gate ,  as if carrying the tree were child s play . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the giant , after he had dragged the heavy burden part of the way , could go no further , and cried: hark you , i shall have to let the tree fall!   the tailor sprang nimbly down , seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it , and said to the giant: you are such a great fellow , and yet cannot even carry the tree!  <s> <s> they went on together , and as they passed a cherry - tree , the giant laid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging , bent it down , gave it into the tailor s hand , and bade him eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree , and when the giant let it go , it sprang back again , and the tailor was tossed into the air with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?   there is no lack of strength ,  answered the little tailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you think that could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i leapt over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jump as i did , if you can do it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the giant made the attempt but he could not get over the tree , and remained hanging in the branches , so that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the giant said: if you are such a valiant fellow , come with me into our cavern and spend the night with us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the little tailor was willing , and followed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little tailor looked round and thought: it is much more spacious here than in my workshop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the giant showed him a bed , and said he was to lie down in it and sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bed , however , was too big for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it , but crept into a corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when it was midnight , and the giant thought that the little tailor was lying in a sound sleep , he got up , took a great iron bar , cut through the bed with one blow , and thought he had finished off the grasshopper for good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the earliest dawn the giants went into the forest , and had quite forgotten the little tailor , when all at once he walked up to them quite merrily and boldly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the giants were terrified , they were afraid that he would strike them all dead , and ran away in a great hurry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little tailor went onwards , always following his own pointed nose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whilst he lay there , the people came and inspected him on all sides , and read on his girdle: seven at one stroke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  ah!   said they , what does the great warrior want here in the midst of peace? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he must be a mighty lord . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  they went and announced him to the king , and gave it as their opinion that if war should break out , this would be a weighty and useful man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the counsel pleased the king , and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military service when he awoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ambassador remained standing by the sleeper , waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes , and then conveyed to him this proposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for this very reason have i come here ,  the tailor replied , i am ready to enter the king s service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he was therefore honourably received , and a special dwelling was assigned him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the soldiers , however , were set against the little tailor , and wished him a thousand miles away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is to be the end of this?   they said among themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if we quarrel with him , and he strikes about him , seven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are not prepared ,  said they , to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the king was sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants , wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor , and would willingly have been rid of him again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thought about it for a long time , and at last found good counsel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a forest of his country lived two giants , who caused great mischief with their robbing , murdering , ravaging , and burning , and no one could approach them without putting himself in danger of death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if the tailor conquered and killed these two giants , he would give him his only daughter to wife , and half of his kingdom as a dowry , likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!   thought the little tailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one is not offered a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of one s life!   oh , yes ,  he replied , i will soon subdue the giants , and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of two . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the little tailor went forth , and the hundred horsemen followed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he came to the outskirts of the forest , he said to his followers: just stay waiting here , i alone will soon finish off the giants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they lay sleeping under a tree , and snored so that the branches waved up and down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he was halfway up , he slipped down by a branch , until he sat just above the sleepers , and then let one stone after another fall on the breast of one of the giants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a long time the giant felt nothing , but at last he awoke , pushed his comrade , and said: why are you knocking me?   you must be dreaming ,  said the other , i am not knocking you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  they laid themselves down to sleep again , and then the tailor threw a stone down on the second . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is the meaning of this?   cried the other why are you pelting me?   i am not pelting you ,  answered the first , growling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they disputed about it for a time , but as they were weary they let the matter rest , and their eyes closed once more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little tailor began his game again , picked out the biggest stone , and threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other paid him back in the same coin , and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long , that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the little tailor leapt down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a lucky thing ,  said he , that they did not tear up the tree on which i was sitting , or i should have had to sprint on to another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they tore up trees in their sore need , and defended themselves with them , but all that is to no purpose when a man like myself comes , who can kill seven at one blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but are you not wounded?   asked the horsemen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you need not concern yourself about that ,  answered the tailor , they have not bent one hair of mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the horsemen would not believe him , and rode into the forest; there they found the giants swimming in their blood , and all round about lay the torn - up trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he , however , repented of his promise , and again bethought himself how he could get rid of the hero . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm , and you must catch it first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i fear one unicorn still less than two giants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seven at one blow , is my kind of affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he took a rope and an axe with him , went forth into the forest , and again bade those who were sent with him to wait outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not long to seek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the unicorn soon came towards him , and rushed directly on the tailor , as if it would gore him with its horn without more ado . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , i have got the bird ,  said the tailor , and came out from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck , and then with his axe he hewed the horn out of the tree , and when all was ready he led the beast away and took it to the king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that made great havoc in the forest , and the huntsmen should give him their help . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> willingly ,  said the tailor , that is child s play!   he did not take the huntsmen with him into the forest , and they were well pleased that he did not , for the wild boar had several times received them in such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boar ran after him , but the tailor ran round outside and shut the door behind it , and then the raging beast , which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window , was caught . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hero , however , went to the king , who was now , whether he liked it or not , obliged to keep his promise , and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she discovered in what state of life the young lord had been born , and next morning complained of her wrongs to her father , and begged him to help her to get rid of her husband , who was nothing else but a tailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king comforted her and said: leave your bedroom door open this night , and my servants shall stand outside , and when he has fallen asleep shall go in , bind him , and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ll put a screw into that business ,  said the little tailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time , and when she thought that he had fallen asleep , she got up , opened the door , and then lay down again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little tailor , who was only pretending to be asleep , began to cry out in a clear voice: boy , make me the doublet and patch me the pantaloons , or i will rap the yard - measure over your ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i smote seven at one blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i killed two giants , i brought away one unicorn , and caught a wild boar , and am i to fear those who are standing outside the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boy was called hansel and the girl gretel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had little to bite and to break , and once when great dearth fell on the land , he could no longer procure even daily bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now when he thought over this by night in his bed , and tossed about in his anxiety , he groaned and said to his wife: what is to become of us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how are we to feed our poor children , when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?   i ll tell you what , husband ,  answered the woman , early tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them , and give each of them one more piece of bread , and then we will go to our work and leave them alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they will not find the way home again , and we shall be rid of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  no , wife ,  said the man , i will not do that; how can i bear to leave my children alone in the forest? the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i feel very sorry for the poor children , all the same ,  said the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger , and had heard what their stepmother had said to their father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gretel wept bitter tears , and said to hansel: now all is over with us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  be quiet , gretel ,  said hansel , do not distress yourself , i will soon find a way to help us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and when the old folks had fallen asleep , he got up , put on his little coat , opened the door below , and crept outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moon shone brightly , and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when day dawned , but before the sun had risen , the woman came and awoke the two children , saying: get up , you sluggards! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are going into the forest to fetch wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she gave each a little piece of bread , and said: there is something for your dinner , but do not eat it up before then , for you will get nothing else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they all set out together on the way to the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had walked a short time , hansel stood still and peeped back at the house , and did so again and again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his father said: hansel , what are you looking at there and staying behind for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pay attention , and do not forget how to use your legs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  ah , father ,  said hansel , i am looking at my little white cat , which is sitting up on the roof , and wants to say goodbye to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the wife said: fool , that is not your little cat , that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we have done , we will come back and fetch you away . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> hansel and gretel sat by the fire , and when noon came , each ate a little piece of bread , and as they heard the strokes of the wood - axe they believed that their father was near . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as they had been sitting such a long time , their eyes closed with fatigue , and they fell fast asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gretel began to cry and said: how are we to get out of the forest now?   but hansel comforted her and said: just wait a little , until the moon has risen , and then we will soon find the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they knocked at the door , and when the woman opened it and saw that it was hansel and gretel , she said: you naughty children , why have you slept so long in the forest? we thought you were never coming back at all!   the father , however , rejoiced , for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not long afterwards , there was once more great dearth throughout the land , and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father: everything is eaten again , we have one half loaf left , and that is the end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the children must go , we will take them farther into the wood , so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!   the man s heart was heavy , and he thought: it would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the woman , however , would listen to nothing that he had to say , but scolded and reproached him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the children , however , were still awake and had heard the conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the old folks were asleep , hansel again got up , and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before , but the woman had locked the door , and hansel could not get out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless he comforted his little sister , and said: do not cry , gretel , go to sleep quietly , the good god will help us . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> early in the morning came the woman , and took the children out of their beds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their piece of bread was given to them , but it was still smaller than the time before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the way into the forest hansel crumbled his in his pocket , and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hansel , why do you stop and look round?   said the father , go on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof , and wants to say goodbye to me ,  answered hansel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fool!   said the woman , that is not your little pigeon , that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  hansel , however little by little , threw all the crumbs on the path . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woman led the children still deeper into the forest , where they had never in their lives been before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then a great fire was again made , and the mother said: just sit there , you children , and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood , and in the evening when we are done , we will come and fetch you away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when it was noon , gretel shared her piece of bread with hansel , who had scattered his by the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they fell asleep and evening passed , but no one came to the poor children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did not awake until it was dark night , and hansel comforted his little sister and said: just wait , gretel , until the moon rises , and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which i have strewn about , they will show us our way home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the moon came they set out , but they found no crumbs , for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer , they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when it was mid - day , they saw a beautiful snow - white bird sitting on a bough , which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when its song was over , it spread its wings and flew away before them , and they followed it until they reached a little house , on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes , but that the windows were of clear sugar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will set to work on that ,  said hansel , and have a good meal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  hansel reached up above , and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted , and gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the children answered: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and went on eating without disturbing themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly the door opened , and a woman as old as the hills , who supported herself on crutches , came creeping out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hansel and gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do come in , and stay with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no harm shall happen to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she took them both by the hand , and led them into her little house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then good food was set before them , milk and pancakes , with sugar , apples , and nuts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen , and hansel and gretel lay down in them , and thought they were in heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch , who lay in wait for children , and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when a child fell into her power , she killed it , cooked and ate it , and that was a feast day with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> witches have red eyes , and cannot see far , but they have a keen scent like the beasts , and are aware when human beings draw near . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scream as he might , it would not help him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she went to gretel , shook her till she awoke , and cried: get up , lazy thing , fetch some water , and cook something good for your brother , he is in the stable outside , and is to be made fat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  gretel began to weep bitterly , but it was all in vain , for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now the best food was cooked for poor hansel , but gretel got nothing but crab - shells . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every morning the woman crept to the little stable , and cried: hansel , stretch out your finger that i may feel if you will soon be fat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when four weeks had gone by , and hansel still remained thin , she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , then , gretel ,  she cried to the girl , stir yourself , and bring some water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us , we should at any rate have died together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will bake first ,  said the old woman , i have already heated the oven , and kneaded the dough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she pushed poor gretel out to the oven , from which flames of fire were already darting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> creep in ,  said the witch , and see if it is properly heated , so that we can put the bread in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and once gretel was inside , she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it , and then she would eat her , too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she began to howl quite horribly , but gretel ran away and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gretel , however , ran like lightning to hansel , opened his little stable , and cried: hansel , we are saved! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as they had no longer any need to fear her , they went into the witch s house , and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these are far better than pebbles!   said hansel , and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in , and gretel said: i , too , will take something home with me ,  and filled her pinafore full . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now we must be off ,  said hansel , that we may get out of the witch s forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we cannot cross ,  said hansel , i see no foot - plank , and no bridge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and there is also no ferry ,  answered gretel , but a white duck is swimming there: if i ask her , she will help us over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she cried: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the duck came to them , and hansel seated himself on its back , and told his sister to sit by him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the good little duck did so , and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time , the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them , and at length they saw from afar their father s house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman , however , was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then all anxiety was at an end , and they lived together in perfect happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once upon a time , a mouse , a bird , and a sausage , entered into partnership and set up house together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort , and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bird s duty was to fly daily into the wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water , and the sausage saw to the cooking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when people are too well off they always begin to long for something new . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so it came to pass , that the bird , while out one day , met a fellow bird , to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the other bird sneered at him for being a poor simpleton , who did all the hard work , while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beg and pray as the mouse and the sausage might , it was of no use; the bird remained master of the situation , and the venture had to be made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they therefore drew lots , and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood , to the mouse to cook , and to the bird to fetch the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now what happened? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sausage started in search of wood , the bird made the fire , and the mouse put on the pot , and then these two waited till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the sausage remained so long away , that they became uneasy , and the bird flew out to meet him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not flown far , however , when he came across a dog who , having met the sausage , had regarded him as his legitimate booty , and so seized and swallowed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bird complained to the dog of this bare - faced robbery , but nothing he said was of any avail , for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage , and that was the reason his life had been forfeited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he picked up the wood , and flew sadly home , and told the mouse all he had seen and heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were both very unhappy , but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so now the bird set the table , and the mouse looked after the food and , wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage , by rolling in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them , she jumped into the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom , having already parted not only with her skin and hair , but also with life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his alarm and flurry , he threw the wood here and there about the floor , called and searched , but no cook was to be found . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down , caught fire and began to blaze . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bird hastened to fetch some water , but his pail fell into the well , and he after it , and as he was unable to recover himself , he was drowned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them was beautiful and industrious , the other ugly and lazy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now it chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle , and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off , the spindle suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the girl went back to the well not knowing what to do , and at last in her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a beautiful meadow , full of sunshine , and with countless flowers blooming in every direction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she walked over the meadow , and presently she came upon a baker s oven full of bread , and the loaves cried out to her , take us out , take us out , or alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shake me , shake me , i pray ,  cried the tree; my apples , one and all , are ripe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap and walked on again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the old woman called after her , what are you afraid of , dear child? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stay with me; if you will do the work of my house properly for me , i will make you very happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must be very careful , however , to make my bed in the right way , for i wish you always to shake it thoroughly , so that the feathers fly about; then they say , down there in the world , that it is snowing; for i am mother holle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the old woman spoke so kindly , that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she took care to do everything according to the old woman s bidding and every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might , so that the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she stayed on with mother holle for some time , and then she began to grow unhappy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could not at first tell why she felt sad , but she became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was homesick , although she was a thousand times better off with mother holle than with her mother and sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after waiting awhile , she went to mother holle and said , i am so homesick , that i cannot stay with you any longer , for although i am so happy here , i must return to my own people . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then mother holle said , i am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people , and as you have served me so well and faithfully , i will take you home myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is a reward for your industry ,  said mother holle , and as she spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gate was then closed , and the girl found herself back in the old world close to her mother s house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she entered the courtyard , the cock who was perched on the well , called out: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she went in to her mother and sister , and as she was so richly covered with gold , they gave her a warm welcome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she related to them all that had happened , and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches , she thought she should like her ugly , lazy daughter to go and try her fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take us out , take us out , or alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago ,  cried the loaves as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the lazy girl answered , do you think i am going to dirty my hands for you?   and walked on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she only answered , a nice thing to ask me to do , one of the apples might fall on my head ,  and passed on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first day she was very obedient and industrious , and exerted herself to please mother holle , for she thought of the gold she should get in return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day , however , she began to dawdle over her work , and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> worse still , she neglected to make the old woman s bed properly , and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might fly about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so mother holle very soon got tired of her , and told her she might go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lazy girl was delighted at this , and thought to herself , the gold will soon be mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  mother holle led her , as she had led her sister , to the broad gateway; but as she was passing through , instead of the shower of gold , a great bucketful of pitch came pouring over her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is in return for your services ,  said the old woman , and she shut the gate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch , and the cock on the well called out as she saw her: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , try what she would , she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to her as long as she lived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her , but most of all by her grandmother , and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once she gave her a little cap of red velvet , which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called little red - cap . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> one day her mother said to her: come , little red - cap , here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother , she is ill and weak , and they will do her good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> set out before it gets hot , and when you are going , walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path , or you may fall and break the bottle , and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room , don t forget to say ,  - good morning , and don t peep into every corner before you do it . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> i will take great care ,  said little red - cap to her mother , and gave her hand on it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the grandmother lived out in the wood , half a league from the village , and just as little red - cap entered the wood , a wolf met her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> red - cap did not know what a wicked creature he was , and was not at all afraid of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good day , little red - cap ,  said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thank you kindly , wolf . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> whither away so early , little red - cap?  <s> <s> to my grandmother s . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> what have you got in your apron?  <s> <s> cake and wine; yesterday was baking - day , so poor sick grandmother is to have something good , to make her stronger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wolf thought to himself: what a tender young creature! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a nice plump mouthfulshe will be better to eat than the old woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must act craftily , so as to catch both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he walked for a short time by the side of little red - cap , and then he said: see , little red - cap , how pretty the flowers are about herewhy do you not look round? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i believe , too , that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school , while everything else out here in the wood is merry . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> little red - cap raised her eyes , and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees , and pretty flowers growing everywhere , she thought: suppose i take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is so early in the day that i shall still get there in good time ; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and whenever she had picked one , she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on , and ran after it , and so got deeper and deeper into the wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother s house and knocked at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who is there?  <s> <s> little red - cap ,  replied the wolf . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> lift the latch ,  called out the grandmother , i am too weak , and cannot get up . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the wolf lifted the latch , the door sprang open , and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother s bed , and devoured her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> little red - cap , however , had been running about picking flowers , and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more , she remembered her grandmother , and set out on the way to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was surprised to find the cottage - door standing open , and when she went into the room , she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: oh dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how uneasy i feel today , and at other times i like being with grandmother so much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she called out: good morning ,  but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face , and looking very strange . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , grandmother , what big eyes you have!   she said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the better to see you with , my dear . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> but , grandmother , what large hands you have!  <s> <s> the better to hug you with . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the huntsman was just passing the house , and thought to himself: how the old woman is snoring! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have long sought you!   then just as he was going to fire at him , it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother , and that she might still be saved , so he did not fire , but took a pair of scissors , and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how dark it was inside the wolf ; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also , but scarcely able to breathe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> red - cap , however , quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf s belly , and when he awoke , he wanted to run away , but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once , and fell dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then all three were delighted . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> it also related that once when red - cap was again taking cakes to the old grandmother , another wolf spoke to her , and tried to entice her from the path . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but they did not speak , or open the door , so the grey - beard stole twice or thrice round the house , and at last jumped on the roof , intending to wait until red - cap went home in the evening , and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  red - cap carried until the great trough was quite full . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf , and he sniffed and peeped down , and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip , and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough , and was drowned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but red - cap went joyously home , and no one ever did anything to harm her again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said to himself , i will give her to the first suitable man who comes and asks for her hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  not long after a suitor appeared , and as he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with which to find fault , he betrothed his daughter to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day he said to her , you have not yet paid me a visit , although we have been betrothed for some time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my house is out there in the dark forest ,  he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her betrothed only replied , you must come and see me next sunday; i have already invited guests for that day , and that you may not mistake the way , i will strew ashes along the path . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there she saw a lonely house , looking so grim and mysterious , that it did not please her at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again it cried: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last she came to the cellar , and there sat a very , very old woman , who could not keep her head from shaking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can you tell me ,  asked the girl , if my betrothed husband lives here?  <s> <s> ah , you poor child ,  answered the old woman , what a place for you to come to! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is a murderers  den . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you think yourself a promised bride , and that your marriage will soon take place , but it is with death that you will keep your marriage feast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as they have you in their power they will kill you without mercy , and cook and eat you , for they are eaters of men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i did not take pity on you and save you , you would be lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> keep as still as a mouse ,  she said; do not move or speak , or it will be all over with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have long been waiting for an opportunity to escape . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned , dragging another young girl along with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they gave her wine to drink , three glasses full , one of white wine , one of red , and one of yellow , and with that her heart gave way and she died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they tore off her dainty clothing , laid her on a table , and cut her beautiful body into pieces , and sprinkled salt upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the robber took a light and began looking for it , but he could not find it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you looked behind the large cask?   said one of the others . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the old woman is right ,  said the robbers , and they ceased looking for the finger and sat down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine , and before long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar , fast asleep and snoring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all night long they walked , and it was morning before they reached the mill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the girl told her father all that had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and you , my love ,  said the bridegroom , turning to her , is there no tale you know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell us something . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> i will tell you a dream , then ,  said the bride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i went alone through a forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could i find within , but a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and again a second time it said these words . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> my darling , this is only a dream . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> i went on through the house from room to room , but they were all empty , and everything was so grim and mysterious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last i went down to the cellar , and there sat a very , very old woman , who could not keep her head still . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i asked her if my betrothed lived here , and she answered ,  - ah , you poor child , you are come to a murderers  den; your betrothed does indeed live here , but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards cook and eat you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> my darling , this is only a dream . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the old woman hid me behind a large cask , and scarcely had she done this when the robbers returned home , dragging a young girl along with them . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> my darling , this is only a dream . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> and one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her finger , and as it was difficult to draw off , he took a hatchet and cut off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the great cask into my lap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and here is the finger with the ring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bridegroom , who during this recital had grown deadly pale , up and tried to escape , but the guests seized him and held him fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they delivered him up to justice , and he and all his murderous band were condemned to death for their wicked deeds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if it were ever so smallnay , if it were no bigger than my thumbi should be very happy , and love it dearly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  nowodd as you may think itit came to pass that this good woman s wish was fulfilled , just in the very way she had wished it; for , not long afterwards , she had a little boy , who was quite healthy and strong , but was not much bigger than my thumb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and they called him thomas thumb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day , as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel , he said , i wish i had someone to bring the cart after me , for i want to make haste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  oh , father ,  cried tom , i will take care of that; the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the woodman laughed , and said , how can that be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you cannot reach up to the horse s bridle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  never mind that , father ,  said tom; if my mother will only harness the horse , i will get into his ear and tell him which way to go . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart , and put tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go , crying out , go on!   and stop!   as he wanted: and thus the horse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gently!   two strangers came up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they went on into the wood , till at last they came to the place where the woodman was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two strangers were all this time looking on , and did not know what to say for wonder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last one took the other aside , and said , that little urchin will make our fortune , if we can get him , and carry him about from town to town as a show; we must buy him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they went up to the woodman , and asked him what he would take for the little man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but tom , hearing of the bargain they wanted to make , crept up his father s coat to his shoulder and whispered in his ear , take the money , father , and let them have me; i ll soon come back to you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> so the woodman at last said he would sell tom to the strangers for a large piece of gold , and they paid the price . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , put me on the rim of your hat; that will be a nice gallery for me; i can walk about there and see the country as we go along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they did as he wished; and when tom had taken leave of his father they took him away with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they journeyed on till it began to be dusky , and then the little man said , let me get down , i m tired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the man took off his hat , and put him down on a clod of earth , in a ploughed field by the side of the road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but tom ran about amongst the furrows , and at last slipped into an old mouse - hole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good night , my masters!   said he , i m off! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mind and look sharp after me the next time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then they ran at once to the place , and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse - hole , but all in vain; tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite dark , so that they were forced to go their way without their prize , as sulky as could be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when tom found they were gone , he came out of his hiding - place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  at last , by good luck , he found a large empty snail - shell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is lucky ,  said he , i can sleep here very well ; and in he crept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just as he was falling asleep , he heard two men passing by , chatting together; and one said to the other , how can we rob that rich parson s house of his silver and gold?   i ll tell you!   cried tom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  they stood still listening , and tom said , take me with you , and i ll soon show you how to get the parson s money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but where are you?   said they . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look about on the ground ,  answered he , and listen where the sound comes from . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  at last the thieves found him out , and lifted him up in their hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you little urchin!   they said , what can you do for us?   why , i can get between the iron window - bars of the parson s house , and throw you out whatever you want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that s a good thought ,  said the thieves; come along , we shall see what you can do . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when they came to the parson s house , tom slipped through the window - bars into the room , and then called out as loud as he could bawl , will you have all that is here?   at this the thieves were frightened , and said , softly , softly! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall i throw it all out?   now the cook lay in the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and listened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meantime the thieves were frightened , and ran off a little way; but at last they plucked up their hearts , and said , the little urchin is only trying to make fools of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they came back and whispered softly to him , saying , now let us have no more of your roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then tom called out as loud as he could , very well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hold your hands! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here it comes . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the cook heard this quite plain , so she sprang out of bed , and ran to open the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and the maid , having groped about and found nothing , went away for a light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little man crawled about in the hay - loft , and at last found a snug place to finish his night s rest in; so he laid himself down , meaning to sleep till daylight , and then find his way home to his father and mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how woefully he was undone! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cook got up early , before daybreak , to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay - loft , carried away a large bundle of hay , with the little man in the middle of it , fast asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he still , however , slept on , and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow s rick , and the cow had taken tom up in a mouthful of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good lack - a - day!   said he , how came i to tumble into the mill?   but he soon found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about him , that he might not get between the cow s teeth , and so be crushed to death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last down he went into her stomach . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> though he made the best of his bad luck , he did not like his quarters at all; and the worst of it was , that more and more hay was always coming down , and the space left for him became smaller and smaller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t bring me any more hay!  <s> <s> the maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone speak , but seeing nobody , and yet being quite sure it was the same voice that she had heard in the night , she was so frightened that she fell off her stool , and overset the milk - pail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tom , however , was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along , he called out , my good friend , i can show you a famous treat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  where s that?   said the wolf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and then into the pantry , and there you will find cakes , ham , beef , cold chicken , roast pig , apple - dumplings , and everything that your heart can wish . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen , and then into the pantry , and ate and drank there to his heart s content . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this was just what tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a great shout , making all the noise he could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you be easy?   said the wolf; you ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what s that to me?   said the little man; you have had your frolic , now i ve a mind to be merry myself ; and he began , singing and shouting as loud as he could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you stay behind ,  said the woodman , and when i have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the scythe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am here , the wolf has swallowed me . </s> </s>

<s> <s> we have found our dear child again ; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he aimed a great blow , and struck the wolf on the head , and killed him on the spot! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when he was dead they cut open his body , and set tommy free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah!   said the father , what fears we have had for you!   yes , father ,  answered he; i have travelled all over the world , i think , in one way or other , since we parted; and now i am very glad to come home and get fresh air again . </s> </s>

 <s> <s> then they hugged and kissed their dear little son , and gave him plenty to eat and drink , for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new clothes for him , for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so master thumb stayed at home with his father and mother , in peace; for though he had been so great a traveller , and had done and seen so many fine things , and was fond enough of telling the whole story , he always agreed that , after all , there s no place like home! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the side of a wood , in a country a long way off , ran a fine stream of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he took her at her word , and sat himself down to the wheel , and whistled and sang: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done , and the straw was all spun into gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the king came and saw this , he was greatly astonished and pleased; but his heart grew still more greedy of gain , and he shut up the poor miller s daughter again with a fresh task . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> till , long before morning , all was done again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  as soon as she was alone that dwarf came in , and said , what will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?   i have nothing left ,  said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then say you will give me ,  said the little man , the first little child that you may have when you are queen . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then she grieved sorely at her misfortune , and said she would give him all the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off , but in vain; till at last her tears softened him , and he said , i will give you three days  grace , and if during that time you tell me my name , you shall keep your child . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then gretel called out to her master: if the guest does not come , i must take the fowls away from the fire , but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the master said: i will run myself , and fetch the guest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she ran down , set a jug , said: god bless it for you , gretel ,  and took a good drink , and thought that wine should flow on , and should not be interrupted , and took yet another hearty draught . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire , basted them , and drove the spit merrily round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as the roast meat smelt so good , gretel thought: something might be wrong , it ought to be tasted!   she touched it with her finger , and said: ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how good fowls are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!   she ran to the window , to see if the master was not coming with his guest , but she saw no one , and went back to the fowls and thought: one of the wings is burning! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the two wings were eaten , she went and looked for her master , and did not see him . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  then she said: well , gretel , enjoy yourself , one fowl has been cut into , take another drink , and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace , why should god s good gifts be spoilt?   so she ran into the cellar again , took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when one of the chickens was swallowed down , and still her master did not come , gretel looked at the other and said: what one is , the other should be likewise , the two go together; what s right for the one is right for the other; i think if i were to take another draught it would do me no harm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while she was making the most of it , her master came and cried: hurry up , gretel , the guest is coming directly after me!   yes , sir , i will soon serve up ,  answered gretel . </s> </s>

<s> <s> presently the guest came , and knocked politely and courteously at the house - door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gretel ran , and looked to see who was there , and when she saw the guest , she put her finger to her lips and said: hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go away as quickly as you can , if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he certainly did ask you to supper , but his intention is to cut off your two ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!   the guest heard the sharpening , and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master , and cried: you have invited a fine guest!   why , gretel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do you mean by that?   yes ,  said she , he has taken the chickens which i was just going to serve up , off the dish , and has run away with them!   that s a nice trick!   said her master , and lamented the fine chickens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand , crying: just one , just one ,  meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken , and not take both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the guest , however , thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears , and ran as if fire were burning under him , in order to take them both with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once a very old man , whose eyes had become dim , his ears dull of hearing , his knees trembled , and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon , and spilt the broth upon the table - cloth or let it run out of his mouth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his son and his son s wife were disgusted at this , so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove , and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl , and not even enough of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once , too , his trembling hands could not hold the bowl , and it fell to the ground and broke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young wife scolded him , but he said nothing and only sighed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few half - pence , out of which he had to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are you doing there?   asked the father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am making a little trough ,  answered the child , for father and mother to eat out of when i am big . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the man and his wife looked at each other for a while , and presently began to cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they took the old grandfather to the table , and henceforth always let him eat with them , and likewise said nothing if he did spill a little of anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants , and just one poor one , whom they called the little peasant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day he said to her: listen , i have a good idea , there is our gossip the carpenter , he shall make us a wooden calf , and paint it brown , so that it looks like any other , and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the woman also liked the idea , and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf , and painted it as it ought to be , and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> next morning when the cows were being driven out , the little peasant called the cow - herd in and said: look , i have a little calf there , but it is still small and has to be carried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the cow - herd said: all right ,  and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture , and set it among the grass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little calf always remained standing like one which was eating , and the cow - herd said: it will soon run by itself , just look how it eats already!   at night when he was going to drive the herd home again , he said to the calf: if you can stand there and eat your fill , you can also go on your four legs; i don t care to drag you home again in my arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cow - herd answered: it is still standing out there eating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would not stop and come with us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the little peasant said: oh , but i must have my beast back again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then they went back to the meadow together , but someone had stolen the calf , and it was gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cow - herd said: it must have run away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the peasant , however , said: don t tell me that ,  and led the cow - herd before the mayor , who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished , and they were heartily glad , but they had no food for it , and could give it nothing to eat , so it soon had to be killed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they salted the flesh , and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin there , so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the way he passed by a mill , and there sat a raven with broken wings , and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind , he could go no farther , and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the miller s wife was alone in the house , and said to the peasant: lay yourself on the straw there ,  and gave him a slice of bread and cheese . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the peasant ate it , and lay down with his skin beside him , and the woman thought: he is tired and has gone to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the woman served up four different things , roast meat , salad , cakes , and wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just as they were about to sit down and eat , there was a knocking outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woman said: oh , heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is my husband!   she quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove , the wine under the pillow , the salad on the bed , the cakes under it , and the parson in the closet on the porch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she opened the door for her husband , and said: thank heaven , you are back again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is such a storm , it looks as if the world were coming to an end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the man said: i have no objection , but be quick and get me something to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the woman said: but i have nothing but bread and cheese . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the peasant did not require to be invited twice , but got up and ate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was , lying on the ground , and asked: what have you there?   the peasant answered: i have a soothsayer inside it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  can he foretell anything to me?   said the miller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why not?   answered the peasant: but he only says four things , and the fifth he keeps to himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the miller was curious , and said: let him foretell something for once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the peasant pinched the raven s head , so that he croaked and made a noise like krr , krr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  bless me!   cried the miller , and went there and found the wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  upon my word!   cried the miller , and went thither , and found the roast meat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the peasant made the raven prophesy still more , and said: thirdly , he says that there is some salad on the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that would be a fine thing!   cried the miller , and went there and found the salad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that would be a fine thing!   cried the miller , and looked there , and found the cakes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now the two sat down to the table together , but the miller s wife was frightened to death , and went to bed and took all the keys with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they ate , and after that they bargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy , until they agreed on three hundred talers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the peasant once more pinched the raven s head till he croaked loudly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the miller asked: what did he say?   the peasant replied: he says that the devil is hiding outside there in the closet on the porch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the small peasant was brought before the mayor , and bidden to say from whence his wealth came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he answered: i sold my cow s skin in the town , for three hundred talers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the peasants heard that , they too wished to enjoy this great profit , and ran home , killed all their cows , and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the town to the greatest advantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when she came to the merchant in the town , he did not give her more than two talers for a skin , and when the others came , he did not give them so much , and said: what can i do with all these skins?  <s> <s> then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus outwitted them , wanted to take vengeance on him , and accused him of this treachery before the mayor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the innocent little peasant was unanimously sentenced to death , and was to be rolled into the water , in a barrel pierced full of holes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was led forth , and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said to him: i set you free from the closet , set me free from the barrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  at this same moment up came , with a flock of sheep , the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor , so he cried with all his might: no , i will not do it; if the whole world insists on it , i will not do it!   the shepherd hearing that , came up to him , and asked: what are you about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is it that you will not do?   the peasant said: they want to make me mayor , if i will but put myself in the barrel , but i will not do it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the shepherd said: if nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor , i would get into the barrel at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the peasant said: if you will get in , you will be mayor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the shepherd was willing , and got in , and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd s flock for himself , and drove it away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  they believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was saying this , and answered: that is what we intend , but first you shall look about you a little down below there ,  and they rolled the barrel down into the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after that the peasants went home , and as they were entering the village , the small peasant also came quietly in , driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the peasants were astonished , and said: peasant , from whence do you come? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you come out of the water?   yes , truly ,  replied the peasant , i sank deep , deep down , until at last i got to the bottom; i pushed the bottom out of the barrel , and crept out , and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding , and from thence i brought this flock away with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they went to the water together , and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky , which are called little lambs , and they were reflected in the water , whereupon the peasants cried: we already see the sheep down below!   the mayor pressed forward and said: i will go down first , and look about me , and if things promise well i ll call you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he jumped in; splash! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> went the water; it sounded as if he were calling them , and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the entire village was dead , and the small peasant , as sole heir , became a rich man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once a man called frederick: he had a wife whose name was catherine , and they had not long been married . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day frederick said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kate! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am going to work in the fields; when i come back i shall be hungry so let me have something nice cooked , and a good draught of ale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  very well ,  said she , it shall all be ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when dinner - time drew nigh , catherine took a nice steak , which was all the meat she had , and put it on the fire to fry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the steak soon began to look brown , and to crackle in the pan; and catherine stood by with a fork and turned it: then she said to herself , the steak is almost ready , i may as well go to the cellar for the ale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the beer ran into the jug and catherine stood looking on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last it popped into her head , the dog is not shut uphe may be running away with the steak; that s well thought of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> away ran catherine , and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran faster than she , and stuck close to the steak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now all this time the ale was running too , for catherine had not turned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till the cask was empty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a lucky thing ,  said she , that we kept that meal! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have now a good use for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so away she went for it: but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of beer , and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she strewed the meal all about the cellar , and was quite pleased with her cleverness , and said , how very neat and clean it looks!  <s> <s> at noon frederick came home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , wife ,  cried he , what have you for dinner?   o frederick!   answered she , i was cooking you a steak; but while i went down to draw the ale , the dog ran away with it; and while i ran after him , the ale ran out; and when i went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair , i upset the jug: but the cellar is now quite dry , and looks so clean!   kate , kate ,  said he , how could you do all this?   why did you leave the steak to fry , and the ale to run , and then spoil all the meal?   why , frederick ,  said she , i did not know i was doing wrong; you should have told me before . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the husband thought to himself , if my wife manages matters thus , i must look sharp myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he said to catherine , what pretty yellow buttons these are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go near or meddle with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  as soon as he was gone , there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes , and they asked her whether she would buy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh dear me , i should like to buy very much , but i have no money: if you had any use for yellow buttons , i might deal with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  yellow buttons!   said they: let us have a look at them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  go into the garden and dig where i tell you , and you will find the yellow buttons: i dare not go myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the rogues went: and when they found what these yellow buttons were , they took them all away , and left her plenty of plates and dishes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she set them all about the house for a show: and when frederick came back , he cried out , kate , what have you been doing?   see ,  said she , i have bought all these with your yellow buttons: but i did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves and dug them up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  wife , wife ,  said frederick , what a pretty piece of work you have made! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you to do such a thing?   why ,  answered she , i did not know there was any harm in it; you should have told me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> catherine stood musing for a while , and at last said to her husband , hark ye , frederick , we will soon get the gold back: let us run after the thieves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  well , we will try ,  answered he; but take some butter and cheese with you , that we may have something to eat by the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it does not matter ,  thought she: when we turn back , i shall be so much nearer home than he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , see now ,  said she , how they have bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she took pity on them , and made use of the butter to grease them all , so that the wheels might not hurt them so much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while she was doing this kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket , and rolled down the hill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she said she supposed that they knew the road , and would follow her , and she could not stay there all day waiting for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last she overtook frederick , who desired her to give him something to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where are the butter and cheese?   said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh!   answered she , i used the butter to grease those poor trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so i sent the other after it to find it , and i suppose they are both on the road together somewhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what a goose you are to do such silly things!   said the husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can you say so?   said she; i am sure you never told me not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  no ,  answered she , you did not tell me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then go home , and do it now before we go any farther ,  said frederick , and bring with you something to eat . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> catherine did as he told her , and thought to herself by the way , frederick wants something to eat; but i don t think he is very fond of butter and cheese: i ll bring him a bag of fine nuts , and the vinegar , for i have often seen him take some . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when she reached home , she bolted the back door , but the front door she took off the hinges , and said , frederick told me to lock the door , but surely it can nowhere be so safe if i take it with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out , there , frederick , there is the door itself , you may watch it as carefully as you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i sent you to make the house fast , and you take the door away , so that everybody may go in and out as they pleasehowever , as you have brought the door , you shall carry it about with you for your pains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  very well ,  answered she , i ll carry the door; but i ll not carry the nuts and vinegar bottle alsothat would be too much of a load; so if you please , i ll fasten them to the door . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> frederick of course made no objection to that plan , and they set off into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and when it grew dark , they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely were they up , than who should come by but the very rogues they were looking for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were in truth great rascals , and belonged to that class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired; so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where frederick and catherine were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he climbed up again , and tried to hit the thieves on the head with them: but they only said , it must be near morning , for the wind shakes the fir - apples down . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> catherine , who had the door on her shoulder , began to be very tired; but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said softly , frederick , i must let the nuts go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  no ,  answered he , not now , they will discover us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i can t help that: they must go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  well , then , make haste and throw them down , if you will . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> a little while after , catherine thought the door was still very heavy: so she whispered to frederick , i must throw the vinegar down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  pray don t ,  answered he , it will discover us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i can t help that ,  said she , go it must . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves said , what a heavy dew there is!  <s> <s> at last it popped into catherine s head that it was the door itself that was so heavy all the time: so she whispered , frederick , i must throw the door down soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but he begged and prayed her not to do so , for he was sure it would betray them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here goes , however ,  said she: and down went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves , that they cried out murder!   and not knowing what was coming , ran away as fast as they could , and left all the gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two daughters , one ugly and wicked , and this one she loved because she was her own daughter , and one beautiful and good , and this one she hated , because she was her stepdaughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stepdaughter once had a pretty apron , which the other fancied so much that she became envious , and told her mother that she must and would have that apron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be quiet , my child ,  said the old woman , and you shall have it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your stepsister has long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep i will come and cut her head off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed , and push her well to the front . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  it would have been all over with the poor girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner , and heard everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all day long she dared not go out of doors , and when bedtime had come , the witch s daughter got into bed first , so as to lie at the far side , but when she was asleep , the other pushed her gently to the front , and took for herself the place at the back , close by the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the night , the old woman came creeping in , she held an axe in her right hand , and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside , and then she grasped the axe with both hands , and cut her own child s head off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when daylight comes , and she sees what she has done , we shall be lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she hurried away with her lover . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the old witch got up next morning , she called her daughter , and wanted to give her the apron , but she did not come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the witch cried: where are you?   here , on the stairs , i am sweeping ,  answered the first drop of blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old woman went out , but saw no one on the stairs , and cried again: where are you?   here in the kitchen , i am warming myself ,  cried the second drop of blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she cried again: where are you?   ah , here in the bed , i am sleeping ,  cried the third drop of blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she went into the room to the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what did she see there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that shall not help you ,  cried she , even if you have got a long way off , you shall still not escape me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this the girl and her sweetheart roland resumed their natural shapes again , and they walked on the whole night until daybreak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge , and her sweetheart roland into a fiddler . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not long before the witch came striding up towards them , and said to the musician: dear musician , may i pluck that beautiful flower for myself?   oh , yes ,  he replied , i will play to you while you do it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  as she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower , knowing perfectly well who the flower was , he began to play , and whether she would or not , she was forced to dance , for it was a magical dance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the faster he played , the more violent springs was she forced to make , and the thorns tore her clothes from her body , and pricked her and wounded her till she bled , and as he did not stop , she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then in the meantime i will stay here and wait for you ,  said the girl , and that no one may recognize me , i will change myself into a red stone landmark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from that time forth , strange things happened in the shepherd s house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he arose in the morning , all the work was already done , the room was swept , the table and benches cleaned , the fire in the hearth was lighted , and the water was fetched , and at noon , when he came home , the table was laid , and a good dinner served . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the shepherd did as she bade him , and next morning just as day dawned , he saw the chest open , and the flower come out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instantly the transformation came to an end , and a beautiful girl stood before him , who admitted to him that she had been the flower , and that up to this time she had attended to his house - keeping . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she told him her story , and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him , but she answered: no ,  for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart roland , although he had deserted her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless , she promised not to go away , but to continue keeping house for the shepherd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now the time drew near when roland s wedding was to be celebrated , and then , according to an old custom in the country , it was announced that all the girls were to be present at it , and sing in honour of the bridal pair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when it came to her turn to sing , she stepped back , until at last she was the only one left , and then she could not refuse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart roland , and grief came to an end and joy began . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the middle of winter , when the broad flakes of snow were falling around , that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working at her window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the frame of the window was made of fine black ebony , and as she sat looking out upon the snow , she pricked her finger , and three drops of blood fell upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had a fairy looking - glass , to which she used to go , and then she would gaze upon herself in it , and say: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the glass had always answered: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as bright as the day , and fairer than the queen herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the glass one day answered the queen , when she went to look in it as usual: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy , and called to one of her servants , and said , take snowdrop away into the wide wood , that i may never see her any more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the servant led her away; but his heart melted when snowdrop begged him to spare her life , and he said , i will not hurt you , thou pretty child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he left her by herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her in pieces , he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to her fate , with the chance of someone finding and saving her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything was spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth , and there were seven little plates , seven little loaves , and seven little glasses with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by the wall stood seven little beds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she was very hungry , she picked a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she tried all the little beds; but one was too long , and another was too short , till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself down and went to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by and by in came the masters of the cottage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they lighted up their seven lamps , and saw at once that all was not right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first said , who has been sitting on my stool?   the second , who has been eating off my plate?   the third , who has been picking my bread?   the fourth , who has been meddling with my spoon?   the fifth , who has been handling my fork?   the sixth , who has been cutting with my knife?   the seventh , who has been drinking my wine?   then the first looked round and said , who has been lying on my bed?   and the rest came running to him , and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the seventh saw snowdrop , and called all his brethren to come and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought their lamps to look at her , and said , good heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the morning snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her , and said if she would keep all things in order , and cook and wash and knit and spin for them , she might stay where she was , and they would take good care of her . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> but the queen , now that she thought snowdrop was dead , believed that she must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar , and went her way over the hills , to the place where the dwarfs dwelt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she knocked at the door , and cried , fine wares to sell!   snowdrop looked out at the window , and said , good day , good woman! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  snowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work so nimbly , and pulled the lace so tight , that snowdrop s breath was stopped , and she fell down as if she were dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there s an end to all thy beauty ,  said the spiteful queen , and went away home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and i need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful snowdrop stretched out upon the ground , as if she was quite dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they said , the old woman was the queen herself; take care another time , and let no one in when we are away . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when the queen got home , she went straight to her glass , and spoke to it as before; but to her great grief it still said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice , to see that snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again , but in quite another dress from the one she wore before , and took with her a poisoned comb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she reached the dwarfs  cottage , she knocked at the door , and cried , fine wares to sell!   but snowdrop said , i dare not let anyone in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the queen said , only look at my beautiful combs!   and gave her the poisoned one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and it looked so pretty , that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head , the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there you may lie ,  said the queen , and went her way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening; and when they saw snowdrop lying on the ground , they thought what had happened , and soon found the poisoned comb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when they took it away she got well , and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  do as you please ,  said the old woman , but at any rate take this pretty apple; i will give it you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  no ,  said snowdrop , i dare not take it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you think it is poisoned? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  now the apple was so made up that one side was good , though the other side was poisoned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then snowdrop was much tempted to taste , for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat , she could wait no longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time nothing will save thee ,  said the queen; and she went home to her glass , and at last it said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when evening came , and the dwarfs had gone home , they found snowdrop lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips , and they were afraid that she was quite dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they lifted her up , and combed her hair , and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain , for the little girl seemed quite dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so they laid her down upon a bier , and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said , we will never bury her in the cold ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and they made a coffin of glass , so that they might still look at her , and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was , and that she was a king s daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the coffin was set among the hills , and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the birds of the air came too , and bemoaned snowdrop; and first of all came an owl , and then a raven , and at last a dove , and sat by her side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last a prince came and called at the dwarfs  house; and he saw snowdrop , and read what was written in golden letters . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then he told her all that had happened , and said , i love you far better than all the world; so come with me to my father s palace , and you shall be my wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and snowdrop consented , and went home with the prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to the feast was asked , among the rest , snowdrop s old enemy the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes , she looked in the glass and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great , that she could not help setting out to see the bride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once upon a time a queen to whom god had given no children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every morning she went into the garden and prayed to god in heaven to bestow on her a son or a daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then an angel from heaven came to her and said: be at rest , you shall have a son with the power of wishing , so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for , that shall he have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened once when the child was a little older , that it was lying in her arms and she fell asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then came the old cook , who knew that the child had the power of wishing , and stole it away , and he took a hen , and cut it in pieces , and dropped some of its blood on the queen s apron and on her dress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the king saw the blood on her apron , he believed this , fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built , in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into it , and walled up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink , and die of hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but god sent two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves , which flew to her twice a day , and carried her food until the seven years were over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cook , however , thought to himself: if the child has the power of wishing , and i am here , he might very easily get me into trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he left the palace and went to the boy , who was already big enough to speak , and said to him: wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with a garden , and all else that pertains to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  scarcely were the words out of the boy s mouth , when everything was there that he had wished for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a while the cook said to him: it is not well for you to be so alone , wish for a pretty girl as a companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two played together , and loved each other with all their hearts , and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thought occurred to him , however , that the king s son might some day wish to be with his father , and thus bring him into great peril . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he went out and took the maiden aside , and said: tonight when the boy is asleep , go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart , and bring me his heart and tongue , and if you do not do it , you shall lose your life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the wicked wretch came in and said: where are the boy s heart and tongue?   the girl reached the plate to him , but the king s son threw off the quilt , and said: you old sinner , why did you want to kill me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now will i pronounce thy sentence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck , and shall eat burning coals , till the flames burst forth from your throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king s son remained there a short while longer , and he thought of his mother , and wondered if she were still alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length he said to the maiden: i will go home to my own country; if you will go with me , i will provide for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  ah ,  she replied , the way is so long , and what shall i do in a strange land where i am unknown?   as she did not seem quite willing , and as they could not be parted from each other , he wished that she might be changed into a beautiful pink , and took her with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went away to his own country , and the poodle had to run after him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went to the tower in which his mother was confined , and as it was so high , he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he mounted up and looked inside , and cried: beloved mother , lady queen , are you still alive , or are you dead?   she answered: i have just eaten , and am still satisfied ,  for she thought the angels were there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he: i am your dear son , whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms; but i am alive still , and will soon set you free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king said yes , if he was skilful and could get game for him , he should come to him , but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the district or country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the huntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the royal table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he summoned all the huntsmen together , and bade them go out into the forest with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he went with them and made them form a great circle , open at one end where he stationed himself , and began to wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they were all assembled together , he said to the huntsman: as you are so clever , you shall sit by me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he replied: lord king , your majesty must excuse me , i am a poor huntsman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is she still alive , or has she died?   but the king replied: she let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; i will not have her named . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the huntsman arose and said: gracious lord father she is alive still , and i am her son , and i was not carried away by wild beasts , but by that wretch the old cook , who tore me from her arms when she was asleep , and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a chicken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar , and said: that is the wretch!   and caused live coals to be brought , and these the dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all , until flames burst forth from its throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape , and wished him back into the form of the cook , in which he stood immediately , with his white apron , and his knife by his side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the huntsman spoke further and said: father , will you see the maiden who brought me up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me , but did not do it , though her own life depended on it?   the king replied: yes , i would like to see her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the son said: most gracious father , i will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower ,  and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink , and placed it on the royal table , and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the son said: now will i show her to you in her own form ,  and wished that she might become a maiden , and she stood there looking so beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the king sent two waiting - maids and two attendants into the tower , to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when she was led in she ate nothing , and said: the gracious and merciful god who has supported me in the tower , will soon set me free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she lived three days more , and then died happily , and when she was buried , the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower , and were angels of heaven , followed her body and seated themselves on her grave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his son married the beautiful maiden whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket , and whether they are still alive or not , is known to god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once a man who had a daughter who was called clever elsie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  yes ,  said the mother , if only someone would come who would have her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  well ,  said hans , if she is not really smart , i won t have her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when they were sitting at dinner and had eaten , the mother said: elsie , go into the cellar and fetch some beer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then clever elsie took the pitcher from the wall , went into the cellar , and tapped the lid briskly as she went , so that the time might not appear long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she was below she fetched herself a chair , and set it before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop , and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then clever elsie began to weep and said: if i get hans , and we have a child , and he grows big , and we send him into the cellar here to draw beer , then the pick - axe will fall on his head and kill him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body , over the misfortune which lay before her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel , screaming loudly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah ,  she answered , have i not reason to weep? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then said the maid: what a clever elsie we have!   and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a while , as the maid did not come back , and those upstairs were thirsty for the beer , the man said to the boy: just go down into the cellar and see where elsie and the girl are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the boy went down , and there sat clever elsie and the girl both weeping together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i get hans , and we have a child , and he grows big , and has to draw beer here , the pick - axe will fall on his head and kill him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then said the boy: what a clever elsie we have!   and sat down by her , and likewise began to howl loudly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upstairs they waited for the boy , but as he still did not return , the man said to the woman: just go down into the cellar and see where elsie is!   the woman went down , and found all three in the midst of their lamentations , and inquired what was the cause; then elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick - axe , when it grew big and had to draw beer , and the pick - axe fell down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then said the mother likewise: what a clever elsie we have!   and sat down and wept with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but when he got into the cellar , and they were all sitting together crying , and he heard the reason , and that elsie s child was the cause , and the elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day , and that he might be killed by the pick - axe , if he should happen to be sitting beneath it , drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down , he cried: oh , what a clever elsie!   and sat down , and likewise wept with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bridegroom stayed upstairs alone for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: they must be waiting for me below: i too must go there and see what they are about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what misfortune has happened then?   asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , dear hans ,  said elsie , if we marry each other and have a child , and he is big , and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink , then the pick - axe which has been left up there might dash his brains out if it were to fall down , so have we not reason to weep?   come ,  said hans , more understanding than that is not needed for my household , as you are such a clever elsie , i will have you ,  and seized her hand , took her upstairs with him , and married her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after hans had had her some time , he said: wife , i am going out to work and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we may have some bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  yes , dear hans , i will do that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , i will eat first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied , she once more said: what shall i do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall i cut first , or shall i sleep first? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will sleep first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but when evening came and she still stayed away , hans went out to see what she had cut , but nothing was cut , and she was lying among the corn asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he ran home , shut the house - door , and sat down in his chair and worked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , when it was quite dark , clever elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about her , and the bells rang at each step which she took . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she was alarmed , and became uncertain whether she really was clever elsie or not , and said: is it i , or is it not i?   but she knew not what answer to make to this , and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought: i will go home and ask if it be i , or if it be not i , they will be sure to know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then it is not i ,  and went to another door; but when the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it , and she could get in nowhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she ran out of the village , and no one has seen her since . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last it came into the man s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went to his master , and said , i have worked hard for you a long time , i will trust to you to give me what i deserve to have for my trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the farmer was a sad miser , and knew that his man was very simple - hearted; so he took out threepence , and gave him for every year s service a penny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can now travel into the wide world , and make myself merry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  with that he put his money into his purse , and set out , roaming over hill and valley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he jogged along over the fields , singing and dancing , a little dwarf met him , and asked him what made him so merry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , what should make me down - hearted?   said he; i am sound in health and rich in purse , what should i care for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have saved up my three years  earnings and have it all safe in my pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> full threepence ,  replied the countryman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the man pitied him , and gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return , as you have such a kind honest heart , i will grant you three wishesone for every penny; so choose whatever you like . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck , and said , i like many things better than money: first , i will have a bow that will bring down everything i shoot at; secondly , a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly , i should like that everyone should grant what i ask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the dwarf said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle , and went his way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before , he was now ten times more so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not gone far before he met an old miser: close by them stood a tree , and on the topmost twig sat a thrush singing away most joyfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  if that s all ,  said the countryman , i will soon bring it down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him , and he himself was all scratched and wounded , so that the blood ran down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> master! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the miser began to beg and promise , and offered money for his liberty; but he did not come up to the musician s price for some time , and he danced him along brisker and brisker , and the miser bid higher and higher , till at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse , and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the countryman saw so much money , he said , i will agree to your proposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he took the purse , put up his fiddle , and travelled on very pleased with his bargain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half - naked and in a piteous plight , and began to ponder how he should take his revenge , and serve his late companion some trick . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the miser began to tell his tale , and said he had been robbed of his money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , you gave it me for playing a tune to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said , my lord judge , grant me one last request . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  anything but thy life ,  replied the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no ,  said he , i do not ask my life; only to let me play upon my fiddle for the last time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for heaven s sake don t listen to him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t listen to him!   but the judge said , it is only this once , he will soon have done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the miser said , bind me fast , bind me fast , for pity s sake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the countryman seized his fiddle , and struck up a tune , and at the first note judge , clerks , and jailer were in motion; all began capering , and no one could hold the miser . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the second note the hangman let his prisoner go , and danced also , and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune , all were dancing togetherjudge , court , and miser , and all the people who had followed to look on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at first the thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while , and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing , they began to cry out , and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties , till the judge not only gave him his life , but promised to return him the hundred florins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he called to the miser , and said , tell us now , you vagabond , where you got that gold , or i shall play on for your amusement only ,  i stole it ,  said the miser in the presence of all the people; i acknowledge that i stole it , and that you earned it fairly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the countryman stopped his fiddle , and left the miser to take his place at the gallows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew nigh , she called her only daughter to her bed - side , and said , always be a good girl , and i will look down from heaven and watch over you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died , and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept , and was always good and kind to all about her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the snow fell and spread a beautiful white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came , and the sun had melted it away again , her father had married another wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this new wife had two daughters of her own , that she brought home with her; they were fair in face but foul at heart , and it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight , to bring the water , to make the fire , to cook and to wash . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the evening when she was tired , she had no bed to lie down on , but was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this , of course , made her always dusty and dirty , they called her ashputtel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened once that the father was going to the fair , and asked his wife s daughters what he should bring them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fine clothes ,  said the first; pearls and diamonds ,  cried the second . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , child ,  said he to his own daughter , what will you have?   the first twig , dear father , that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come homewards ,  said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the tree , and talked with her , and watched over her , and brought her whatever she wished for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now it happened that the king of that land held a feast , which was to last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose a bride for himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you , ashputtel!   said she; you who have nothing to wear , no clothes at all , and who cannot even danceyou want to go to the ball? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then first came two white doves , flying in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle - doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven , chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work , pick , pick , pick; and then the others began to pick , pick , pick: and among them all they soon picked out all the good grain , and put it into a dish but left the ashes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ashputtel brought the dish to her mother , overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the ball . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the mother said , no , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and when ashputtel begged very hard to go , she said , if you can in one hour s time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes , you shall go too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and thus she thought she should at least get rid of her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle - doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven , chirping and hopping about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and they flew down into the ashes; and the little doves put their heads down and set to work , pick , pick , pick; and then the others began pick , pick , pick; and they put all the good grain into the dishes , and left all the ashes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before half an hour s time all was done , and out they flew again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then ashputtel took the dishes to her mother , rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now when all were gone , and nobody left at home , ashputtel went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel - tree , and cried out: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then her friend the bird flew out of the tree , and brought a gold and silver dress for her , and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them on , and followed her sisters to the feast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king s son soon came up to her , and took her by the hand and danced with her , and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone else came to ask her to dance , he said , this lady is dancing with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she slipped away from him , unawares , and ran off towards home; and as the prince followed her , she jumped up into the pigeon - house and shut the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he waited till her father came home , and told him that the unknown maiden , who had been at the feast , had hid herself in the pigeon - house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she had worn the day before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the king s son lost sight of her , and could not find out where she was gone , but waited till her father came home , and said to him , the unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away , and i think she must have sprung into the pear - tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the father thought to himself , can it be ashputtel?   so he had an axe brought; and they cut down the tree , but found no one upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when they came back into the kitchen , there lay ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped down on the other side of the tree , and carried her beautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel - tree , and then put on her little grey frock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the third day , when her father and mother and sisters were gone , she went again into the garden , and said: </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when night came she wanted to go home; and the king s son would go with her , and said to himself , i will not lose her this time ; but , however , she again slipped away from him , though in such a hurry that she dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prince took the shoe , and went the next day to the king his father , and said , i will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper fits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they had beautiful feet , and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eldest went first into the room where the slipper was , and wanted to try it on , and the mother stood by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the mother gave her a knife , and said , never mind , cut it off; when you are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the silly girl cut off her great toe , and thus squeezed on the shoe , and went to the king s son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but on their way home they had to pass by the hazel - tree that ashputtel had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw , by the blood that streamed from it , what a trick she had played him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he turned his horse round , and brought the false bride back to her home , and said , this is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put on the slipper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she went into the room and got her foot into the shoe , all but the heel , which was too large . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but her mother squeezed it in till the blood came , and took her to the king s son: and he set her as his bride by his side on his horse , and rode away with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when they came to the hazel - tree the little dove sat there still , and sang: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he looked down , and saw that the blood streamed so much from the shoe , that her white stockings were quite red . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he turned his horse and brought her also back again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the prince told him to send her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the mother said , no , no , she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  however , the prince would have her come; and she first washed her face and hands , and then went in and curtsied to him , and he reached her the golden slipper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot , and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when they came to the hazel - tree , the white dove sang: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when the dove had done its song , it came flying , and perched upon her right shoulder , and so went home with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through all the land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he had a strange custom; every day after dinner , when the table was cleared , and no one else was present , a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was covered , however , and even the servant did not know what was in it , neither did anyone know , for the king never took off the cover to eat of it until he was quite alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this had gone on for a long time , when one day the servant , who took away the dish , was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying the dish into his room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had carefully locked the door , he lifted up the cover , and saw a white snake lying on the dish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went and listened , and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together , and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king ordered the man to be brought before him , and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief , he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and , whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills , they were having a confidential conversation together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servant stood by and listened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning , and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: something lies heavy on my stomach; as i was eating in haste i swallowed a ring which lay under the queen s window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the servant at once seized her by the neck , carried her to the kitchen , and said to the cook: here is a fine duck; pray , kill her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  yes ,  said the cook , and weighed her in his hand; she has spared no trouble to fatten herself , and has been waiting to be roasted long enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he cut off her head , and as she was being dressed for the spit , the queen s ring was found inside her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servant refused everything , and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling , as he had a mind to see the world and go about a little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , though it is said that fishes are dumb , he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably , and , as he had a kind heart , he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they leapt with delight , put out their heads , and cried to him: we will remember you and repay you for saving us!  <s> <s> he rode on , and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that stupid horse , with his heavy hoofs , has been treading down my people without mercy!   so he turned on to a side path and the ant - king cried out to him: we will remember youone good turn deserves another!  <s> <s> the path led him into a wood , and there he saw two old ravens standing by their nest , and throwing out their young ones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> out with you , you idle , good - for - nothing creatures!   cried they; we cannot find food for you any longer; you are big enough , and can provide for yourselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the poor young ravens lay upon the ground , flapping their wings , and crying: oh , what helpless chicks we are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what can we do , but lie here and starve?   so the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword , and gave it to them for food . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a great noise and crowd in the streets , and a man rode up on horseback , crying aloud: the king s daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard task , and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  all the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away , leaving him alone by the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stood on the shore and considered what he should do , when suddenly he saw three fishes come swimming towards him , and they were the very fishes whose lives he had saved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the one in the middle held a mussel in its mouth , which it laid on the shore at the youth s feet , and when he had taken it up and opened it , there lay the gold ring in the shell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the promised reward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth , she scorned him , and required him first to perform another task . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten sacksful of millet - seed on the grass; then she said: tomorrow morning before sunrise these must be picked up , and not a single grain be wanting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw all the ten sacks standing side by side , quite full , and not a single grain was missing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ant - king had come in the night with thousands and thousands of ants , and the grateful creatures had by great industry picked up all the millet - seed and gathered them into the sacks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently the king s daughter herself came down into the garden , and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she could not yet conquer her proud heart , and said: although he has performed both the tasks , he shall not be my husband until he had brought me an apple from the tree of life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the youth did not know where the tree of life stood , but he set out , and would have gone on for ever , as long as his legs would carry him , though he had no hope of finding it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after he had wandered through three kingdoms , he came one evening to a wood , and lay down under a tree to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he heard a rustling in the branches , and a golden apple fell into his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time three ravens flew down to him , perched themselves upon his knee , and said: we are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when we had grown big , and heard that you were seeking the golden apple , we flew over the sea to the end of the world , where the tree of life stands , and have brought you the apple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the youth , full of joy , set out homewards , and took the golden apple to the king s beautiful daughter , who had now no more excuses left to make . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they cut the apple of life in two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him , and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids , and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wretch often disguises himself , but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the kids said: dear mother , we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the old one bleated , and went on her way with an easy mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not long before someone knocked at the house - door and called: open the door , dear children; your mother is here , and has brought something back with her for each of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will not open the door ,  cried they , you are not our mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he came back , knocked at the door of the house , and called: open the door , dear children , your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the wolf had laid his black paws against the window , and the children saw them and cried: we will not open the door , our mother has not black feet like you: you are the wolf!   then the wolf ran to a baker and said: i have hurt my feet , rub some dough over them for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the miller thought to himself: the wolf wants to deceive someone ,  and refused; but the wolf said: if you will not do it , i will devour you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> truly , this is the way of mankind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so now the wretch went for the third time to the house - door , knocked at it and said: open the door for me , children , your dear little mother has come home , and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the little kids cried: first show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the wolf found them all , and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the youngest , who was in the clock - case , was the only one he did not find . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the table , chairs , and benches were thrown down , the washing - bowl lay broken to pieces , and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she sought her children , but they were nowhere to be found . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last , when she came to the youngest , a soft voice cried: dear mother , i am in the clock - case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she took the kid out , and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what rejoicing there was! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they embraced their dear mother , and jumped like a tailor at his wedding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mother , however , said: now go and look for some big stones , and we will fill the wicked beast s stomach with them while he is still asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the seven kids dragged the stones thither with all speed , and put as many of them into this stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste , so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink , the heavy stones made him fall in , and he drowned miserably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the seven kids saw that , they came running to the spot and cried aloud: the wolf is dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two kings  sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living , so that they could not return home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then their brother , who was a little insignificant dwarf , went out to seek for his brothers: but when he had found them they only laughed at him , to think that he , who was so young and simple , should try to travel through the world , when they , who were so much wiser , had been unable to get on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , they all set out on their journey together , and came at last to an ant - hill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two elder brothers would have pulled it down , in order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> so on they went , and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two brothers wanted to catch two , and roast them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the dwarf said , let the poor things enjoy themselves , you shall not kill them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  next they came to a bees  - nest in a hollow tree , and there was so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to light a fire under the tree and kill the bees , so as to get their honey . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> at length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the stables they saw fine horses standing there , but all were of marble , and no man was to be seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they went through all the rooms , till they came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door was a wicket , so that they could look into the next room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there they saw a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or twice , but he did not hear: however , they called a third time , and then he rose and came out to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said nothing , but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and drunk , he showed each of them to a bed - chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table , where there were three tablets , containing an account of the means by which the castle might be disenchanted . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the eldest brother set out , and sought for the pearls the whole day: but the evening came , and he had not found the first hundred: so he was turned into stone as the tablet had foretold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as he sat there , the king of the ants ( whose life he had saved ) came to help him , with five thousand ants; and it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a heap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and as the dwarf came to the brink of it , he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the third task was the hardest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was to choose out the youngest and the best of the king s three daughters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus the spell was broken , and all who had been turned into stones awoke , and took their proper forms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the dwarf married the youngest and the best of the princesses , and was king after her father s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once a shoemaker , who worked very hard and was very honest: but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he had in the world was gone , save just leather enough to make one pair of shoes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed , left all his cares to heaven , and soon fell asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the morning after he had said his prayers , he sat himself down to his work; when , to his great wonder , there stood the shoes all ready made , upon the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the whole job; all was so neat and true , that it was quite a masterpiece . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same day a customer came in , and the shoes suited him so well that he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor shoemaker , with the money , bought leather enough to make two pairs more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the evening he cut out the work , and went to bed early , that he might get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble , for when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon in came buyers , who paid him handsomely for his goods , so that he bought leather enough for four pair more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cut out the work again overnight and found it done in the morning , as before; and so it went on for some time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak , and the good man soon became thriving and well off again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one evening , about christmas - time , as he and his wife were sitting over the fire chatting together , he said to her , i should like to sit up and watch tonight , that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning , and hid themselves in a corner of the room , behind a curtain that was hung up there , and watched what would happen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and on they went , till the job was quite done , and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as lightning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day the wife said to the shoemaker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these little wights have made us rich , and we ought to be thankful to them , and do them a good turn if we can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and indeed it is not very decent , for they have nothing upon their backs to keep off the cold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ll tell you what , i will make each of them a shirt , and a coat and waistcoat , and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and do you make each of them a little pair of shoes . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening , when all the things were ready , they laid them on the table , instead of the work that they used to cut out , and then went and hid themselves , to watch what the little elves would do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about midnight in they came , dancing and skipping , hopped round the room , and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them , they laughed and chuckled , and seemed mightily delighted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward , as long as they lived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> long , long ago , some two thousand years or so , there lived a rich man with a good and beautiful wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they loved each other dearly , but sorrowed much that they had no children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in front of the house there was a court , in which grew a juniper - tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one winter s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples , and as she was peeling them , she cut her finger , and the blood fell on the snow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah ,  sighed the woman heavily , if i had but a child , as red as blood and as white as snow ,  and as she spoke the words , her heart grew light within her , and it seemed to her that her wish was granted , and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a month passed , and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by , and all the earth was green . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the months followed one another , and first the trees budded in the woods , and soon the green branches grew thickly intertwined , and then the blossoms began to fall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once again the wife stood under the juniper - tree , and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy , and she was so overcome with her happiness , that she fell on her knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a little while later she called her husband , and said to him , weeping . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i die , bury me under the juniper - tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she felt comforted and happy again , and before another month had passed she had a little child , and when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood , her joy was so great that she died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by degrees , however , his sorrow grew less , and although at times he still grieved over his loss , he was able to go about as usual , and later on he married again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife was a boy , who was as red as blood and as white as snow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings , so that the poor child went about in fear , and had no peace from the time he left school to the time he went back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day the little daughter came running to her mother in the store - room , and said , mother , give me an apple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  yes , my child ,  said the wife , and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mother ,  said the little daughter again , may not brother have one too?   the mother was angry at this , but she answered , yes , when he comes out of school . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little boy now came in , and the evil spirit in the wife made her say kindly to him , my son , will you have an apple?   but she gave him a wicked look . </s> </s>

<s> <s> yes , give me an apple . </s> </s>

<s> <s> down went the lid , and off went the little boy s head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if only i can prevent anyone knowing that i did it ,  she thought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she went upstairs to her room , and took a white handkerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy s head again on his shoulders , and bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen , and placed him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> go to him again ,  said her mother , and if he does not answer , give him a box on the ear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so little marleen went , and said , brother , give me that apple ,  but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the ear , and his head rolled off . </s> </s>

<s> <s> oh!   she said , i have knocked off brother s head ,  and then she wept and wept , and nothing would stop her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what have you done!   said her mother , but no one must know about it , so you must keep silence; what is done can t be undone; we will make him into puddings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and she took the little boy and cut him up , made him into puddings , and put him in the pot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked , where is my son?   the mother said nothing , but gave him a large dish of black pudding , and marleen still wept without ceasing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the father again asked , where is my son?  <s> <s> oh ,  answered the wife , he is gone into the country to his mother s great uncle; he is going to stay there some time . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> i feel very unhappy about it ,  said the husband , in case it should not be all right , and he ought to have said goodbye to me . </s> </s>

<s> <s> little marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of her bottom drawer , and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the table and carried them outside , and all the time she did nothing but weep . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the father and little marleen heard the sound and ran out , but they only saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot , and when these had passed , there stood the little brother , and he took the father and little marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced , and went inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last it was so big that it filled a cart , and two oxen could hardly draw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it , nor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> if i sell it , it will bring no more than another; and for eating , the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect . </s> </s>

 <s> <s> the king then took pity on him , and said , you shall be poor no longer . </s> </s>

<s> <s> so he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to lie in ambush , he went to his brother , and said , dear brother , i have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up , and share it between us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out together , and as they were travelling along , the murderers rushed out upon him , bound him , and were going to hang him on a tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but whilst they were getting all ready , they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance , which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack , and swung him up by a cord to the tree , where they left him dangling , and ran away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meantime he worked and worked away , till he made a hole large enough to put out his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the horseman came up , he proved to be a student , a merry fellow , who was journeying along on his nag , and singing as he went . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> compared to this seat , all the learning of the schools is as empty air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a little longer , and i shall know all that man can know , and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wert thou but once here , my friend , though wouldst feel and own the power of knowledge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said , blessed be the day and hour when i found you; cannot you contrive to let me into the sack for a little while?   then the other answered , as if very unwillingly , a little space i may allow thee to sit here , if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour below , till i have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> so the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung heavy upon him , and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith , for his thirst for knowledge was great . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the other pretended to give way , and said , thou must let the sack of wisdom descend , by untying yonder cord , and then thou shalt enter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the student let him down , opened the sack , and set him free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now then ,  cried he , let me ascend quickly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  as he began to put himself into the sack heels first , wait a while ,  said the gardener , that is not the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he pushed him in head first , tied up the sack , and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom dangling in the air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how is it with thee , friend?   said he , dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rest there in peace , till thou art a wiser man than thou wert . </s> </s>

<s> <s> after some time he took it in his head that he would travel to rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he arrived in rome , where the pope had just died , and there was great doubt among the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they at length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be distinguished by some divine and miraculous token . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above , and asked him on the spot if he would be pope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was undecided , and knew not if he were worthy of this , but the doves counselled him to do it , and at length he said yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then was he anointed and consecrated , and thus was fulfilled what he had heard from the frogs on his way , which had so affected him , that he was to be his holiness the pope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good day , dear mr fox , how are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how is all with you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how are you getting on in these hard times?   the fox , full of all kinds of arrogance , looked at the cat from head to foot , and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you the cheek to ask how i am getting on? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what have you learnt? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what art is that?   asked the fox . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the hounds are following me , i can spring into a tree and save myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  is that all?   said the fox . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  just then came a hunter with four dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cat sprang nimbly up a tree , and sat down at the top of it , where the branches and foliage quite concealed her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> open your sack , mr fox , open your sack ,  cried the cat to him , but the dogs had already seized him , and were holding him fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , mr fox ,  cried the cat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had you been able to climb like me , you would not have lost your life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> begin by learning some craft or another , and see how you can get on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had got on some way they came to four crossways , each leading to a different country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the eldest said , here we must part; but this day four years we will come back to this spot , and in the meantime each must try what he can do for himself . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> so each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man met him , and asked him where he was going , and what he wanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am going to try my luck in the world , and should like to begin by learning some art or trade ,  answered he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ,  said the man , go with me , and i will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  no ,  said the other , that is not an honest calling , and what can one look to earn by it in the end but the gallows?   oh!   said the man , you need not fear the gallows; for i will only teach you to steal what will be fair game: i meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care anything about , and where no one can find you out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the second brother also met a man , who , when he found out what he was setting out upon , asked him what craft he meant to follow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not know yet ,  said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then come with me , and be a star - gazer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a noble art , for nothing can be hidden from you , when once you understand the stars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the plan pleased him much , and he soon became such a skilful star - gazer , that when he had served out his time , and wanted to leave his master , he gave him a glass , and said , with this you can see all that is passing in the sky and on earth , and nothing can be hidden from you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the third brother met a huntsman , who took him with him , and taught him so well all that belonged to hunting , that he became very clever in the craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow , and said , whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would not you like ,  said he , to be a tailor?   oh , no!   said the young man; sitting cross - legged from morning to night , working backwards and forwards with a needle and goose , will never suit me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  oh!   answered the man , that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me , and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> after the space of four years , at the time agreed upon , the four brothers met at the four cross - roads; and having welcomed each other , set off towards their father s home , where they told him all that had happened to them , and how each had learned some craft . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the star - gazer took his glass , looked up , and said , five . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  now ,  said the father to the eldest son , take away the eggs without letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know anything of what you are doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the father took the eggs , and put one on each corner of the table , and the fifth in the middle , and said to the huntsman , cut all the eggs in two pieces at one shot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now comes your turn ,  said he to the young tailor; sew the eggs and the young birds in them together again , so neatly that the shot shall have done them no harm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well done , sons!   said the old man; you have made good use of your time , and learnt something worth the knowing; but i am sure i do not know which ought to have the prize . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the four brothers said to each other , here is a chance for us; let us try what we can do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and they agreed to see whether they could not set the princess free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there they found the princess sitting , as the star - gazer had said , on the rock; and the dragon was lying asleep , with his head upon her lap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for he awoke and missed the princess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when he got over the boat , and wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess , the huntsman took up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in his fall he overset the boat , and they had to swim in the open sea upon a few planks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the tailor took his needle , and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these , and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready , and they then reached the ship and got home safe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then there arose a quarrel between them; and the star - gazer said , if i had not found the princess out , all your skill would have been of no use; therefore she ought to be mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  your seeing her would have been of no use ,  said the thief , if i had not taken her away from the dragon; therefore she ought to be mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to make up for your loss , i will give each of you , as a reward for his skill , half a kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the brothers agreed that this plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the king then gave to each half a kingdom , as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days , and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady , than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a merchant , who had three daughters , was once setting out upon a journey; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should bring back for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  now it was no easy task to find a rose , for it was the middle of winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter , and was very fond of flowers , her father said he would try what he could do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he kissed all three , and bid them goodbye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when the time came for him to go home , he had bought pearls and jewels for the two eldest , but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing , the people laughed at him , and asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this grieved him very much , for lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home , thinking what he should bring her , he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden , in one half of which it seemed to be summer - time and in the other half winter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on one side the finest flowers were in full bloom , and on the other everything looked dreary and buried in the snow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a lucky hit!   said he , as he called to his servant , and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there , and bring him away one of the finest flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this done , they were riding away well pleased , when up sprang a fierce lion , and roared out , whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up alive!   then the man said , i knew not that the garden belonged to you; can nothing save my life?   no!   said the lion , nothing , unless you undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you agree to this , i will give you your life , and the rose too for your daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and at last the man yielded with a heavy heart , and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever should meet him first on his return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as he came near home , it was lily , his youngest and dearest daughter , that met him; she came running , and kissed him , and welcomed him home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose , she was still more glad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but her father began to be very sorrowful , and to weep , saying , alas , my dearest child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he told her all that had happened , and said she should not go , let what would happen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she comforted him , and said , dear father , the word you have given must be kept; i will go to the lion , and soothe him: perhaps he will let me come safe home again . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the next morning she asked the way she was to go , and took leave of her father , and went forth with a bold heart into the wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the lion was an enchanted prince . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by day he and all his court were lions , but in the evening they took their right forms again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when lily came to the castle , he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wedding - feast was held , and they lived happily together a long time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came , and then he held his court; but every morning he left his bride , and went away by himself , she knew not whither , till the night came again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more , and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her , for they had thought her dead long since . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her second sister was soon after married , and when lily was asked to go to the wedding , she said to the prince , i will not go alone this timeyou must go with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but he would not , and said that it would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch - light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse , for he should be changed into a dove , and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , she gave him no rest , and said she would take care no light should fall upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so at last they set out together , and took with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick walls for him to sit in while the wedding - torches were lighted; but , unluckily , no one saw that there was a crack in the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the wedding was held with great pomp , but as the train came from the church , and passed with the torches before the hall , a very small ray of light fell upon the prince . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a moment he disappeared , and when his wife came in and looked for him , she found only a white dove; and it said to her , seven years must i fly up and down over the face of the earth , but every now and then i will let fall a white feather , that will show you the way i am going; follow it , and at last you may overtake and set me free . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> this said , he flew out at the door , and poor lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell , and showed her the way she was to journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus she went roving on through the wide world , and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left , nor took any rest , for seven years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she began to be glad , and thought to herself that the time was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still far off , for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white feather , and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now ,  thought she to herself , no aid of man can be of use to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she went to the sun and said , thou shinest everywhere , on the hill s top and the valley s depthhast thou anywhere seen my white dove?   no ,  said the sun , i have not seen it; but i will give thee a casketopen it when thy hour of need comes . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> so she thanked the sun , and went on her way till eventide; and when the moon arose , she cried unto it , and said , thou shinest through the night , over field and grovehast thou nowhere seen my white dove?   no ,  said the moon , i cannot help thee but i will give thee an eggbreak it when need comes . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then she thanked the moon , and went on till the night - wind blew; and she raised up her voice to it , and said , thou blowest through every tree and under every leafhast thou not seen my white dove?   no ,  said the night - wind , but i will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the night - wind said , i will give thee counsel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go to the red sea; on the right shore stand many rodscount them , and when thou comest to the eleventh , break it off , and smite the dragon with it; and so the lion will have the victory , and both of them will appear to you in their own forms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then look round and thou wilt see a griffin , winged like bird , sitting by the red sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved one as quickly as possible , and he will carry you over the waters to your home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will also give thee this nut ,  continued the night - wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you are half - way over , throw it down , and out of the waters will immediately spring up a high nut - tree on which the griffin will be able to rest , otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole way; if , therefore , thou dost forget to throw down the nut , he will let you both fall into the sea . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> so our poor wanderer went forth , and found all as the night - wind had said; and she plucked the eleventh rod , and smote the dragon , and the lion forthwith became a prince , and the dragon a princess again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but no sooner was the princess released from the spell , than she seized the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin s back , and went off carrying the prince away with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> heaven aid me now!   said she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her , and found that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she put it on , and went into the palace , and all the people gazed upon her; and the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be sold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not for gold and silver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  said she , but for flesh and blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  at last the princess agreed , but she told her chamberlain to give the prince a sleeping draught , that he might not hear or see her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when evening came , and the prince had fallen asleep , she was led into his chamber , and she sat herself down at his feet , and said: i have followed thee seven years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have been to the sun , the moon , and the night - wind , to seek thee , and at last i have helped thee to overcome the dragon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then poor lily was led away , and forced to give up the golden dress; and when she saw that there was no help for her , she went out into a meadow , and sat herself down and wept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as she sat she bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it , there ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold , that played about , and then nestled under the old one s wings , so as to form the most beautiful sight in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she rose up and drove them before her , till the bride saw them from her window , and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then the princess thought to betray her as before , and agreed to what she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked the chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her , and how faithful and true to him she had been , he knew his beloved wife s voice , and sprang up , and said , you have awakened me as from a dream , for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me , so that i had altogether forgotten you; but heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they were half - way across lily let the nut fall into the water , and immediately a large nut - tree arose from the sea , whereon the griffin rested for a while , and then carried them safely home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he opened the door and turned him adrift . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently a fox met him: what s the matter , my friend?   said he , why do you hang down your head and look so lonely and woe - begone?   ah!   replied the horse , justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all that i have done for him so many years , and because i can no longer work he has turned me adrift , and says unless i become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can i have of that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he knows i have none , or he would not talk so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the lion was greatly pleased , and set off immediately; and when they came to the horse , the fox said , you will not be able to eat him comfortably here; i ll tell you whati will tie you fast to his tail , and then you can draw him to your den , and eat him at your leisure . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> this advice pleased the lion , so he laid himself down quietly for the fox to make him fast to the horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the work was done , the fox clapped the horse on the shoulder , and said , jip! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dobbin! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the beast began to roar and bellow , till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the horse let him sing on , and made his way quietly over the fields to his master s house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here he is , master ,  said he , i have got the better of him : and when the farmer saw his old servant , his heart relented , and he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thou shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and so the poor old horse had plenty to eat , and livedtill he died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully , but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the soldier did not know how to earn a living , went away greatly troubled , and walked the whole day , until in the evening he entered a forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when darkness came on , he saw a light , which he went up to , and came to a house wherein lived a witch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do give me one night s lodging , and a little to eat and drink ,  said he to her , or i shall starve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet will i be compassionate , and take you in , if you will do what i wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what do you wish?   said the soldier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the soldier spent the whole day in doing it , and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind my house , there is an old dry well , into which my light has fallen , it burns blue , and never goes out , and you shall bring it up again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  next day the old woman took him to the well , and let him down in a basket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found the blue light , and made her a signal to draw him up again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she did draw him up , but when he came near the edge , she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the witch fell into a passion , let him fall again into the well , and went away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground , and the blue light went on burning , but of what use was that to him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw very well that he could not escape death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sat for a while very sorrowfully , then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe , which was still half full . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this shall be my last pleasure ,  thought he , pulled it out , lit it at the blue light and began to smoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the smoke had circled about the cavern , suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him , and said: lord , what are your commands?   what my commands are?   replied the soldier , quite astonished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must do everything you bid me ,  said the little man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good ,  said the soldier; then in the first place help me out of this well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the little man took him by the hand , and led him through an underground passage , but he did not forget to take the blue light with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there , and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he was above , he said to the little man: now go and bind the old witch , and carry her before the judge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  in a short time she came by like the wind , riding on a wild tom - cat and screaming frightfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor was it long before the little man reappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is all done ,  said he , and the witch is already hanging on the gallows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what further commands has my lord?   inquired the dwarf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment , none ,  answered the soldier; you can return home , only be at hand immediately , if i summon you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue light , and i will appear before you at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went to the best inn , ordered himself handsome clothes , and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it , he summoned the little black manikin and said: i have served the king faithfully , but he has dismissed me , and left me to hunger , and now i want to take my revenge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what am i to do?   asked the little man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> late at night , when the king s daughter is in bed , bring her here in her sleep , she shall do servant s work for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the manikin said: that is an easy thing for me to do , but a very dangerous thing for you , for if it is discovered , you will fare ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when twelve o clock had struck , the door sprang open , and the manikin carried in the princess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when she had done this , he ordered her to come to his chair , and then he stretched out his feet and said: pull off my boots ,  and then he threw them in her face , and made her pick them up again , and clean and brighten them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she , however , did everything he bade her , without opposition , silently and with half - shut eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> next morning when the princess arose she went to her father , and told him that she had had a very strange dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was only a dream , and yet i am just as tired as if i really had done everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the dream may have been true ,  said the king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will give you a piece of advice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets , some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket , but they made no track , for the crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and again the princess was compelled to do servant s work until cock - crow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track , but it was all in vain , for in every street poor children were sitting , picking up peas , and saying: it must have rained peas , last night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  we must think of something else ,  said the king; keep your shoes on when you go to bed , and before you come back from the place where you are taken , hide one of them there , i will soon contrive to find it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the black manikin heard this plot , and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess , revealed it to him , and told him that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem , and that if the shoe were found in the soldier s house it would go badly with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do what i bid you ,  replied the soldier , and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant , but before she went away , she hid her shoe under the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter s shoe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was found at the soldier s , and the soldier himself , who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate , was soon brought back , and thrown into prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had , the blue light and the gold , and had only one ducat in his pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now loaded with chains , he was standing at the window of his dungeon , when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the soldier tapped at the pane of glass , and when this man came up , said to him: be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle i have left lying in the inn , and i will give you a ducat for doing it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  his comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as the soldier was alone again , he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have no fear ,  said the latter to his master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go wheresoever they take you , and let them do what they will , only take the blue light with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  next day the soldier was tried , and though he had done nothing wicked , the judge condemned him to death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he was led forth to die , he begged a last favour of the king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is it?   asked the king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that i may smoke one more pipe on my way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light , and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended , the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand , and said: what does my lord command?   strike down to earth that false judge there , and his constable , and spare not the king who has treated me so ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the manikin fell on them like lightning , darting this way and that way , and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth , and did not venture to stir again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once a queen who had a little daughter , still too young to run alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day the child was very troublesome , and the mother could not quiet it , do what she would . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  scarcely were the words out of her mouth , when the child in her arms was turned into a raven , and flew away from her through the open window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time , and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> long after this , a man was making his way through the wood when he heard a raven calling , and he followed the sound of the voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what am i to do?   he asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she replied , go farther into the wood until you come to a house , wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and drink , but you must not take of either; if you do , you will fall into a deep sleep , and will not be able to help me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the garden behind the house is a large tan - heap , and on that you must stand and watch for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall drive there in my carriage at two o clock in the afternoon for three successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white , the second by four chestnut , and the last by four black horses; but if you fail to keep awake and i find you sleeping , i shall not be set free . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the man promised to do all that she wished , but the raven said , alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable to save me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the man assured her again that he would on no account touch a thing to eat or drink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how tired you are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come in and rest and let me give you something to eat and drink . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> no ,  answered the man , i will neither eat not drink . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> but she would not leave him alone , and urged him saying , if you will not eat anything , at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink counts for nothing ,  and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded , and drank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as it drew towards the appointed hour , he went outside into the garden and mounted the tan - heap to await the raven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly a feeling of fatigue came over him , and unable to resist it , he lay down for a little while , fully determined , however , to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes closed of their own accord , and he fell into such a deep sleep , that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when she entered the garden , there she found him as she had feared , lying on the tan - heap , fast asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she got out of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him , but it was all in vain , he still continued sleeping . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day at noon , the old woman came to him again with food and drink which he at first refused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last , overcome by her persistent entreaties that he would take something , he lifted the glass and drank again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> towards two o clock he went into the garden and on to the tan - heap to watch for the raven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not been there long before he began to feel so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him , and he could not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she went as before to look for him , but he slept , and it was impossible to awaken him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the following day the old woman said to him , what is this? </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> but she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him , and when he smelt the wine , he was unable to resist the temptation , and took a deep draught . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan - heap in the garden to await the king s daughter , but he felt even more overcome with weariness than on the two previous days , and throwing himself down , he slept like a log . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at two o clock the raven could be seen approaching , and this time her coachman and everything about her , as well as her horses , were black . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was sadder than ever as she drove along , and said mournfully , i know he has fallen asleep , and will not be able to set me free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she found him sleeping heavily , and all her efforts to awaken him were of no avail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she placed beside him a loaf , and some meat , and a flask of wine , of such a kind , that however much he took of them , they would never grow less . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after that she drew a gold ring , on which her name was engraved , off her finger , and put it upon one of his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> finally , she laid a letter near him , in which , after giving him particulars of the food and drink she had left for him , she finished with the following words: i see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me free; if , however , you still wish to do so , come to the golden castle of stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she then returned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of stromberg . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then his eyes fell on the things which were lying beside him; he read the letter , and knew from it all that had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he rose up without delay , eager to start on his way and to reach the castle of stromberg , but he had no idea in which direction he ought to go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again the next day he pursued his way through the forest , and that evening , thinking to rest again , he lay down as before , but he heard such a howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he waited till it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses , and then seeing a little glimmer ahead of him , he went towards it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was , from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  however , after a while he summoned up courage and went forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the giant saw him , he called out , it is lucky for that you have come , for i have not had anything to eat for a long time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can have you now for my supper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i would rather you let that alone ,  said the man , for i do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food i have enough to satisfy your hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  if that is so ,  replied the giant , i will leave you in peace; i only thought of eating you because i had nothing else . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> so they went indoors together and sat down , and the man brought out the bread , meat , and wine , which although he had eaten and drunk of them , were still unconsumed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the giant was pleased with the good cheer , and ate and drank to his heart s content . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had finished his supper the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of stromberg . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the giant said , i will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns , villages , and houses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he fetched his map , and looked for the castle , but could not find it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never mind ,  he said , i have larger maps upstairs in the cupboard , we will look on those ,  but they searched in vain , for the castle was not marked even on these . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man now thought he should like to continue his journey , but the giant begged him to remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother , who was away in search of provisions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the brother came home , they asked him about the castle of stromberg , and he told them he would look on his own maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how shall i be able to get there?   asked the man . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the giant , thereupon , carried the man to within about a hundred leagues of the castle , where he left him , saying , you will be able to walk the remainder of the way yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the man journeyed on day and night till he reached the golden castle of stromberg . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found it situated , however , on a glass mountain , and looking up from the foot he saw the enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he saw that it was impossible to reach her , he was greatly grieved , and said to himself , i will remain here and wait for her ,  so he built himself a little hut , and there he sat and watched for a whole year , and every day he saw the king s daughter driving round her castle , but still was unable to get nearer to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  they stopped when they heard the call , but looking round and seeing nobody , they went on again with their fighting , which now became more furious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god be with you ,  he cried again , and again they paused and looked about , but seeing no one went back to their fighting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a third time he called out , god be with you ,  and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between the three men , he went out and asked them why they were fighting so angrily with one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of them said that he had found a stick , and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he wished to pass , and it immediately flew open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another told him that he had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle , and even up the glass mountain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had been unable to decide whether they would keep together and have the things in common , or whether they would separate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on hearing this , the man said , i will give you something in exchange for those three things; not money , for that i have not got , but something that is of far more value . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the robbers , therefore , made him get on the horse , and handed him the stick and the cloak , and when he had put this round him he was no longer visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after another , crying , there , you idle vagabonds , you have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!  <s> <s> after this he rode up the glass mountain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he reached the gate of the castle , he found it closed , but he gave it a blow with his stick , and it flew wide open at once and he passed through . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he mounted the steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting , with a golden goblet full of wine in front of her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could not see him for he still wore his cloak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took the ring which she had given him off his finger , and threw it into the goblet , so that it rang as it touched the bottom . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> she sought for him about the castle , but could find him nowhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him , and cried aloud for joy . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> there was a man who had three sons , the youngest of whom was called dummling ,[*] and was despised , mocked , and sneered at on every occasion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood , and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the clever son answered: if i give you my cake and wine , i shall have none for myself; be off with you ,  and he left the little man standing and went on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when he began to hew down a tree , it was not long before he made a false stroke , and the axe cut him in the arm , so that he had to go home and have it bound up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and this was the little grey man s doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after this the second son went into the forest , and his mother gave him , like the eldest , a cake and a bottle of wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little old grey man met him likewise , and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the second son , too , said sensibly enough: what i give you will be taken away from myself; be off!   and he left the little man standing and went on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the father answered: your brothers have hurt themselves with it , leave it alone , you do not understand anything about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but dummling begged so long that at last he said: just go then , you will get wiser by hurting yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  dummling answered: i have only cinder - cake and sour beer; if that pleases you , we will sit down and eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they sat down , and when dummling pulled out his cinder - cake , it was a fine sweet cake , and the sour beer had become good wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so they ate and drank , and after that the little man said: since you have a good heart , and are willing to divide what you have , i will give you good luck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there stands an old tree , cut it down , and you will find something at the roots . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the little man took leave of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dummling went and cut down the tree , and when it fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now the host had three daughters , who saw the goose and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be , and would have liked to have one of its golden feathers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eldest thought: i shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather ,  and as soon as dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing , but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the others are there ,  she thought , i may as well be there too ,  and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her sister , she remained sticking fast to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning dummling took the goose under his arm and set out , without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the middle of the fields the parson met them , and when he saw the procession he said: for shame , you good - for - nothing girls , why are you running across the fields after this young man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is that seemly?   at the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away , but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast , and was himself obliged to run behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before long the sexton came by and saw his master , the parson , running behind three girls . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your reverence , whither away so quickly? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not forget that we have a christening today!   and running after him he took him by the sleeve , but was also held fast to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other , two labourers came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast , and now there were seven of them running behind dummling and the goose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon afterwards he came to a city , where a king ruled who had a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when dummling heard this , he went with his goose and all her train before the king s daughter , and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on , one behind the other , she began to laugh quite loudly , and as if she would never stop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thereupon dummling asked to have her for his wife; but the king did not like the son - in - law , and made all manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dummling thought of the little grey man , who could certainly help him; so he went into the forest , and in the same place where he had felled the tree , he saw a man sitting , who had a very sorrowful face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so sorely , and he answered: i have such a great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water i cannot stand , a barrel of wine i have just emptied , but that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!  <s> <s> there , i can help you ,  said dummling , just come with me and you shall be satisfied . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> he led him into the king s cellar , and the man bent over the huge barrels , and drank and drank till his loins hurt , and before the day was out he had emptied all the barrels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then dummling asked once more for his bride , but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow , whom everyone called dummling , should take away his daughter , and he made a new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain of bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dummling did not think long , but went straight into the forest , where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap , and making an awful face , and saying: i have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls , but what good is that when one has such a hunger as i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my stomach remains empty , and i must tie myself up if i am not to die of hunger . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> at this dummling was glad , and said: get up and come with me; you shall eat yourself full . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he led him to the king s palace where all the flour in the whole kingdom was collected , and from it he caused a huge mountain of bread to be baked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man from the forest stood before it , began to eat , and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again sought a way out , and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as you come sailing back in it ,  said he , you shall have my daughter for wife . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> dummling went straight into the forest , and there sat the little grey man to whom he had given his cake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he heard what dummling wanted , he said: since you have given me to eat and to drink , i will give you the ship; and i do all this because you once were kind to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wedding was celebrated , and after the king s death , dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this king once fell very illso ill that nobody thought he could live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they told him that their father was very ill , and that they were afraid nothing could save him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know what would ,  said the little old man; it is the water of life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the prince thought to himself , if i bring my father this water , he will make me sole heir to his kingdom . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a deep valley , overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around , he saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf , with a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said , prince , whither so fast?   what is that to thee , you ugly imp?   said the prince haughtily , and rode on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour , and laid a fairy spell of ill - luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower , and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came , he heard a loud laugh ringing round him , and found that the path was closed behind him , so that he was shut in all round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he next tried to get off his horse and make his way on foot , but again the laugh rang in his ears , and he found himself unable to move a step , and thus he was forced to abide spellbound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son s return , till at last the second son said , father , i will go in search of the water of life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  for he thought to himself , my brother is surely dead , and the kingdom will fall to me if i find the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the king was at first very unwilling to let him go , but at last yielded to his wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done , and met with the same elf , who stopped him at the same spot in the mountains , saying , as before , prince , prince , whither so fast?   mind your own affairs , busybody!   said the prince scornfully , and rode on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder brother , and he , too , was at last obliged to take up his abode in the heart of the mountains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus it is with proud silly people , who think themselves above everyone else , and are too proud to ask or take advice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the second prince had thus been gone a long time , the youngest son said he would go and search for the water of life , and trusted he should soon be able to make his father well again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he set out , and the dwarf met him too at the same spot in the valley , among the mountains , and said , prince , whither so fast?   and the prince said , i am going in search of the water of life , because my father is ill , and like to die: can you help me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray be kind , and aid me if you can!   do you know where it is to be found?   asked the dwarf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no ,  said the prince , i do not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray tell me if you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and , that you may be able to reach it in safety , i will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand , and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their prey , but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to the well , and take some of the water of life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for ever . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his friendly aid , and took the wand and the bread , and went travelling on and on , over sea and over land , till he came to his journey s end , and found everything to be as the dwarf had told him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door flew open at the third stroke of the wand , and when the lions were quieted he went on through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> around it he saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings and put them on his own fingers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in another room he saw on a table a sword and a loaf of bread , which he also took . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> further on he came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him joyfully , and said , if he would set her free from the spell that bound her , the kingdom should be his , if he would come back in a year and marry her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she told him that the well that held the water of life was in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste , and draw what he wanted before the clock struck twelve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself , as he felt tired , that he would rest himself for a while , and gaze on the lovely scenes around him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he sprang from the couch dreadfully frightened , ran to the well , filled a cup that was standing by him full of water , and hastened to get away in time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just as he was going out of the iron door it struck twelve , and the door fell so quickly upon him that it snapped off a piece of his heel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he found himself safe , he was overjoyed to think that he had got the water of life; and as he was going on his way homewards , he passed by the little dwarf , who , when he saw the sword and the loaf , said , you have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole armies , and the bread will never fail you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the prince begged so hard for his brothers , that the dwarf at last set them free , though unwillingly , saying , beware of them , for they have bad hearts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  their brother , however , was greatly rejoiced to see them , and told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the water of life , and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful princess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to wait a whole year , and then to marry him , and to give him the kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they all three rode on together , and on their way home came to a country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine , so that it was feared all must die for want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the prince gave the king of the land the bread , and all his kingdom ate of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they came to the sea , they got into a ship and during their voyage the two eldest said to themselves , our brother has got the water which we could not find , therefore our father will forsake us and give him the kingdom , which is our right ; so they were full of envy and revenge , and agreed together how they could ruin him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely , however , had he tasted the bitter sea - water when he became worse even than he was before; and then both the elder sons came in , and blamed the youngest for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father , but that they had found the water of life , and had brought it with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he no sooner began to drink of what they brought him , than he felt his sickness leave him , and was as strong and well as in his younger days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they went to their brother , and laughed at him , and said , well , brother , you found the water of life , did you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have had the trouble and we shall have the reward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray , with all your cleverness , why did not you manage to keep your eyes open? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> next year one of us will take away your beautiful princess , if you do not take care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you had better say nothing about this to our father , for he does not believe a word you say; and if you tell tales , you shall lose your life into the bargain: but be quiet , and we will let you off . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the old king was still very angry with his youngest son , and thought that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court together , and asked what should be done , and all agreed that he ought to be put to death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the prince begged very hard , and said , only tell me what it is , and do not think i shall be angry , for i will forgive you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he took the prince s coat , and gave him the shabby one , and went away through the wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some time after , three grand embassies came to the old king s court , with rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now all these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword and loaf of bread , in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how it grieves me that i had him killed!   he is still alive ,  said the huntsman; and i am glad that i had pity on him , but let him go in peace , and brought home his royal coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  at this the king was overwhelmed with joy , and made it known throughout all his kingdom , that if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should come back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining gold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback , and rode straight up to the gate upon it , was her true lover; and that they must let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it , they must be sure was not the right one; and that they must send him away at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the time soon came , when the eldest brother thought that he would make haste to go to the princess , and say that he was the one who had set her free , and that he should have her for his wife , and the kingdom with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he came before the palace and saw the golden road , he stopped to look at it , and he thought to himself , it is a pity to ride upon this beautiful road ; so he turned aside and rode on the right - hand side of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now when the full year was come round , the third brother left the forest in which he had lain hid for fear of his father s anger , and set out in search of his betrothed bride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he journeyed on , thinking of her all the way , and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was made of , but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the gate it flew open , and the princess welcomed him with joy , and said he was her deliverer , and should now be her husband and lord of the kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now the old king gathered together his court , and asked all his kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and young and old , noble and squire , gentle and simple , came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf , with the sugarloaf hat , and a new scarlet cloak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once a king s son who had a bride whom he loved very much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when he was sitting beside her and very happy , news came that his father lay sick unto death , and desired to see him once again before his end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he said to his beloved: i must now go and leave you , i give you a ring as a remembrance of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i am king , i will return and fetch you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing , and said: yes , dear father , your will shall be done ,  and thereupon the king shut his eyes , and died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when therefore the son had been proclaimed king , and the time of mourning was over , he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father , and caused the king s daughter to be asked in marriage , and she was promised to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his first betrothed heard of this , and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then her father said to her: dearest child , why are you so sad? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you shall have whatsoever you will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the father said: if it be possible , your desire shall be fulfilled ,  and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom , until eleven young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face , figure , and size . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they came to the king s daughter , she had twelve suits of huntsmen s clothes made , all alike , and the eleven maidens had to put on the huntsmen s clothes , and she herself put on the twelfth suit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thereupon she took her leave of her father , and rode away with them , and rode to the court of her former betrothed , whom she loved so dearly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king , however , had a lion which was a wondrous animal , for he knew all concealed and secret things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it came to pass that one evening he said to the king: you think you have twelve huntsmen?   yes ,  said the king , they are twelve huntsmen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men have a firm step , and when they walk over peas none of them stir , but girls trip and skip , and drag their feet , and the peas roll about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the king was well pleased with the counsel , and caused the peas to be strewn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the king s daughter thanked him , and said to her maidens: show some strength , and step firmly on the peas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they went away again , and the king said to the lion: you have lied to me , they walk just like men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the king liked the advice , and had the spinning - wheels placed in the ante - chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the servant , who was well disposed to the huntsmen , went to them , and disclosed the project . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so when they were alone the king s daughter said to her eleven girls: show some constraint , and do not look round at the spinning - wheels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the king again said to the lion: you have deceived me , they are men , for they have not looked at the spinning - wheels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the lion replied: they have restrained themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the king , however , would no longer believe the lion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase , and his liking for them continually increased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now it came to pass that once when they were out hunting , news came that the king s bride was approaching . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the true bride heard that , it hurt her so much that her heart was almost broken , and she fell fainting to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he saw the ring which he had given to his first bride , and when he looked in her face he recognized her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then his heart was so touched that he kissed her , and when she opened her eyes he said: you are mine , and i am yours , and no one in the world can alter that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had two richly laden ships then making a voyage upon the seas , in which he had embarked all his wealth , in the hope of making great gains , when the news came that both were lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the merchant told him how all his wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea , and how he had nothing left but that little plot of land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , trouble not yourself about that ,  said the dwarf; only undertake to bring me here , twelve years hence , whatever meets you first on your going home , and i will give you as much as you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber - room to look for some old iron , that he might sell it and raise a little money; and there , instead of his iron , he saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boy one day asked what was the matter , but his father would not tell for some time; at last , however , he said that he had , without knowing it , sold him for gold to a little , ugly - looking , black dwarf , and that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then heinel said , father , give yourself very little trouble about that; i shall be too much for the little man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little black dwarf soon came , and walked round and round about the circle , but could not find any way to get into it , and he either could not , or dared not , jump over it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last the boy said to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you anything to say to us , my friend , or what do you want?   now heinel had found a friend in a good fairy , that was fond of him , and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what good luck was in store for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  fair and softly ,  said the little old man; right is right; i have paid my money , and your father has had it , and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what i paid it for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the old man grinned , and showed his teeth , as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then at last , after a long talk , they came to terms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> heinel agreed that his father must give him up , and that so far the dwarf should have his way: but , on the other hand , the fairy had told heinel what fortune was in store for him , if he followed his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump - backed friend , who seemed so anxious for his company . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter , it was settled that heinel should be put into an open boat , that lay on the sea - shore hard by; that the father should push him off with his own hand , and that he should thus be set adrift , and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he took leave of his father , and set himself in the boat , but before it got far off a wave struck it , and it fell with one side low in the water , so the merchant thought that poor heinel was lost , and went home very sorrowful , while the dwarf went his way , thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boat , however , did not sink , for the good fairy took care of her friend , and soon raised the boat up again , and it went safely on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man sat safe within , till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle but empty and dreary within , for it was enchanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him , and said , are you at last come to set me free? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twelve long years have i waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she promised , for you alone can save me . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  and all came to pass as she had said; heinel bore all , and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came , and fell on his neck and kissed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle , the wedding was celebrated , and he was crowned king of the golden mountain . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  however , he gave her no rest till she agreed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at his going away she gave him a wishing - ring , and said , take this ring , and put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father s house . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when he came to his father s house , he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him , and said he had had but one son , his poor heinel , who he knew was long since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd , he would not even give him anything to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he showed them the mark , and they knew that what he had said was true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he next told them how he was king of the golden mountain , and was married to a princess , and had a son seven years old . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept , and said he had broken his word , and bad luck would follow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did all he could to soothe her , and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth , and was only thinking how she should punish him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day he took her to walk with him out of the town , and showed her the spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he sat himself down , and said , i am very much tired; sit by me , i will rest my head in your lap , and sleep a while . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  as soon as he had fallen asleep , however , she drew the ring from his finger , and crept softly away , and wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when he awoke he found himself alone , and saw that the ring was gone from his finger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can never go back to my father s house ,  said he; they would say i am a sorcerer: i will journey forth into the world , till i come again to my kingdom . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> so saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill , where three giants were sharing their father s goods; and as they saw him pass they cried out and said , little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods between us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  now there was a sword that cut off an enemy s head whenever the wearer gave the words , heads off!  ; a cloak that made the owner invisible , or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that carried the wearer wherever he wished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they gave him the cloak , and he wished himself a fly , and in a moment he was a fly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  no ,  said they; not unless you undertake not to say ,  - heads off! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for if you do we are all dead men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they gave it him , charging him to try it on a tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he next asked for the boots also; and the moment he had all three in his power , he wished himself at the golden mountain; and there he was at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the giants were left behind with no goods to share or quarrel about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and the people around told him that his queen was about to marry another husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when anything to eat was put upon her plate , he took it away and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her , he took it and drank it; and thus , though they kept on giving her meat and drink , her plate and cup were always empty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon this , fear and remorse came over her , and she went into her chamber alone , and sat there weeping; and he followed her there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why then does this enchantment still seem to bind me?  <s> <s> false and fickle one!   said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the princes , peers , and great men mocked at him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , he would enter into no parley with them , but only asked them if they would go in peace or not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> heads off!   cried he; and with the word the traitors  heads fell before him , and heinel was once more king of the golden mountain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he remained standing a while , and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  what must i do?   asked the peasant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first place buy yourself an a b c book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece; in the second , turn your cart and your two oxen into money , and get yourself some clothes , and whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly , have a sign painted for yourself with the words:  - i am doctor knowall , and have that nailed up above your house - door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the peasant did everything that he had been told to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he was told about doctor knowall who lived in such and such a village , and must know what had become of the money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the lord was willing , and let both of them have a seat in the carriage , and they all drove away together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , but my wife , grete , too ,  said he , and he seated himself with her at the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare , the peasant nudged his wife , and said: grete , that was the first ,  meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the second did not want to go in at all , but was forced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so when he went in with his dish , the peasant nudged his wife , and said: grete , that is the second . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  this servant was equally alarmed , and he got out as fast as he could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the third fared no better , for the peasant again said: grete , that is the third . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the fourth had to carry in a dish that was covered , and the lord told the doctor that he was to show his skill , and guess what was beneath the cover . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor looked at the dish , had no idea what to say , and cried: ah , poor crabb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this the doctor was satisfied , and returned to the hall , sat down to the table , and said: my lord , now will i search in my book where the gold is hidden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the fifth servant , however , crept into the stove to hear if the doctor knew still more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the doctor sat still and opened his a b c book , turned the pages backwards and forwards , and looked for the cock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he could not find it immediately he said: i know you are there , so you had better come out!   then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him , and full of terror , sprang out , crying: that man knows everything!   then doctor knowall showed the lord where the money was , but did not say who had stolen it , and received from both sides much money in reward , and became a renowned man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although the little girl was very pretty , she was so weak and small that they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be christened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some water , but the other six ran with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each wanted to be first at drawing the water , and so they were in such a hurry that all let their pitchers fall into the well , and they stood very foolishly looking at one another , and did not know what to do , for none dared go home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the meantime the father was uneasy , and could not tell what made the young men stay so long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> surely ,  said he , the whole seven must have forgotten themselves over some game of play ; and when he had waited still longer and they yet did not come , he flew into a rage and wished them all turned into ravens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely had he spoken these words when he heard a croaking over his head , and looked up and saw seven ravens as black as coal flying round and round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sorry as he was to see his wish so fulfilled , he did not know how what was done could be undone , and comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons with his dear little daughter , who soon became stronger and every day more beautiful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes ,  said they , she is beautiful indeed , but still tis a pity that her brothers should have been lost for her sake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she was much grieved , and went to her father and mother , and asked if she had any brothers , and what had become of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there , and she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was to be done? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she wanted to save her brothers , and had no key of the castle of the glass - mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger , that was just the size of the piece of wood she had lost , and put it in the door and opened it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she went in , a little dwarf came up to her , and said , what are you seeking for?   i seek for my brothers , the seven ravens ,  answered she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the dwarf said , my masters are not at home; but if you will wait till they come , pray step in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air , and the dwarf said , here come my masters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when they came in , they wanted to eat and drink , and looked for their little plates and glasses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then said one after the other ,<s> <s> who has eaten from my little plate? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stretched himself out under the bench , did not move a limb , and behaved as if he were stone dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when it became known that the old fox was dead , suitors presented themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the maid heard someone standing at the house - door , knocking . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she answered: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , thank you , miss ,  said the fox , what is mrs fox doing?   the maid replied: </s> </s>

<s> <s>  certainly , young sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon afterwards there was another knock , and another fox was at the door who wished to woo mrs fox . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had two tails , but he did not fare better than the first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after this still more came , each with one tail more than the other , but they were all turned away , until at last one came who had nine tails , like old mr fox . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the widow heard that , she said joyfully to the cat: </s> </s>

<s> <s> no , thank you , mrs cat ,  answered the wolf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is mrs fox not at home?  <s> <s> the cat said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wolf answered: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he won t do for me . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at length came a young fox . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then mrs fox said: has the gentleman red stockings on , and has a little pointed mouth?   yes ,  said the cat , he has . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then let him come upstairs ,  said mrs fox , and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the wedding was solemnized with young mr fox , and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off , they are dancing still . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood , there came up a little old woman , and said to him , good day , good day; you seem merry enough , but i am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me something to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the huntsman took pity on her , and put his hand in his pocket and gave her what he had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shoot into the midst of them , and one will fall down dead: the cloak will fall too; take it , it is a wishing - cloak , and when you wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cut open the dead bird , take out its heart and keep it , and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is the bird s heart that will bring you this good luck . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the huntsman thanked her , and thought to himself , if all this does happen , it will be a fine thing for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when he had gone a hundred steps or so , he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him , and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills and feet; screaming , fighting , and tugging at each other as if each wished to have it himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well ,  said the huntsman , this is wonderful; this happens just as the old woman said ; then he shot into the midst of them so that their feathers flew all about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> off went the flock chattering away; but one fell down dead , and the cloak with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the huntsman did as the old woman told him , cut open the bird , took out the heart , and carried the cloak home with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow , and there lay the piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day , and indeed every day when he arose . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then he took leave of his friends , and hung his bag and bow about his neck , and went his way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now the old woman was a witch , and said to the young lady , there is a young man coming out of the wood who carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him , my dear child , for it is more fit for us than for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has a bird s heart that brings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  meantime the huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady , and said to himself , i have been travelling so long that i should like to go into this castle and rest myself , for i have money enough to pay for anything i want ; but the real reason was , that he wanted to see more of the beautiful lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the old woman said , now is the time for getting the bird s heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the lady stole it away , and he never found any more gold under his pillow , for it lay now under the young lady s , and the old woman took it away every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his prize . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well ,  said the old witch , we have got the bird s heart , but not the wishing - cloak yet , and that we must also get . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  let us leave him that ,  said the young lady; he has already lost his wealth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she did as the old woman told her , and set herself at the window , and looked about the country and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said , what makes you so sad?   alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dear sir ,  said she , yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow , and i want so much to go there , that whenever i think of it i cannot help being sorrowful , for who can reach it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the finest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the old witch made a deep sleep come upon him , and he said to the young lady , let us sit down and rest ourselves a little , i am so tired that i cannot stand any longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they sat down , and he laid his head in her lap and fell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from his shoulders , hung it on her own , picked up the diamonds , and wished herself home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him , and left him alone on the wild rock , he said , alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what roguery there is in the world!   and there he sat in great grief and fear , not knowing what to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as he saw three of them striding about , he thought to himself , i can only save myself by feigning to be asleep ; so he laid himself down as if he were in a sound sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the giants came up to him , the first pushed him with his foot , and said , what worm is this that lies here curled up?   tread upon him and kill him ,  said the second . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it s not worth the trouble ,  said the third; let him live , he ll go climbing higher up the mountain , and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they were gone , he climbed to the top of the mountain , and when he had sat there a short time a cloud came rolling around him , and caught him in a whirlwind and bore him along for some time , till it settled in a garden , and he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  at last he thought to himself , i can eat salad , it will refresh and strengthen me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he swallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed , and saw with horror that he was turned into an ass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , he still felt very hungry , and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad , and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him , and soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and the bad salad , and thought to himself , this will help me to my fortune again , and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he stained his face all over brown , so that even his mother would not have known him , and went into the castle and asked for a lodging; i am so tired ,  said he , that i can go no farther . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what is your business?   i am ,  said he , a messenger sent by the king to find the finest salad that grows under the sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have been lucky enough to find it , and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to wither , and i don t know that i can carry it farther . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad , they longed to taste it , and said , dear countryman , let us just taste it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  to be sure ,  answered he; i have two heads of it with me , and will give you one ; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the witch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was ready she could not wait till it was carried up , but took a few leaves immediately and put them in her mouth , and scarcely were they swallowed when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the form of an ass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he thought something must have happened , and said , i will go into the kitchen and see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and as he went he saw two asses in the court running about , and the salad lying on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all right!   said he; those two have had their share . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he took up the rest of the leaves , laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady , saying , i bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she ate of it , and like the others ran off into the court braying away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now you shall be paid for your roguery ,  said he; and tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he came to a mill and knocked at the window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have three tiresome beasts here ,  said the other; if you will take them , give them food and room , and treat them as i tell you , i will pay you whatever you ask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  with all my heart ,  said the miller; but how shall i treat them?   then the huntsman said , give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next ( who was the servant - maid ) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest ( who was the beautiful lady ) hay three times a day and no stripes : for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after this he went back to the castle , where he found everything he wanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some days after , the miller came to him and told him that the old ass was dead; the other two ,  said he , are alive and eat , but are so sorrowful that they cannot last long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees before him , and said , o dearest huntsman! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your wishing - cloak hangs up in the closet , and as for the bird s heart , i will give it you too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they were married , and lived together very happily till they died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a certain father had two sons , the elder of who was smart and sensible , and could do everything , but the younger was stupid and could neither learn nor understand anything , and when people saw him they said: there s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!   when anything had to be done , it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late , or in the night - time , and the way led through the churchyard , or any other dismal place , he answered: oh , no father , i ll not go there , it makes me shudder!   for he was afraid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or when stories were told by the fire at night which made the flesh creep , the listeners sometimes said: oh , it makes us shudder!   the younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them , and could not imagine what they could mean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are always saying:  - it makes me shudder , it makes me shudder! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it does not make me shudder ,  thought he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look how your brother works , but you do not even earn your salt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  well , father ,  he replied , i am quite willing to learn somethingindeed , if it could but be managed , i should like to learn how to shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i don t understand that at all yet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he will never be good for anything as long as he lives! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he who wants to be a sickle must bend himself betimes . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the father sighed , and answered him: you shall soon learn what it is to shudder , but you will not earn your bread by that . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit , and the father bewailed his trouble , and told him how his younger son was so backward in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> send him to me , and i will soon polish him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the sexton therefore took him into his house , and he had to ring the church bell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a day or two , the sexton awoke him at midnight , and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and ring the bell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you shall soon learn what shuddering is ,  thought he , and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round , and was just going to take hold of the bell rope , he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who is there?   cried he , but the figure made no reply , and did not move or stir . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the sexton , however , remained standing motionless that the boy might think he was a ghost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the boy called to him for the third time , and as that was also to no purpose , he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs , so that it fell down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thereupon he rang the bell , went home , and without saying a word went to bed , and fell asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length she became uneasy , and wakened the boy , and asked: do you know where my husband is? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just go there and you will see if it was he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should be sorry if it were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the woman ran away and found her husband , who was lying moaning in the corner , and had broken his leg . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she carried him down , and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy s father , your boy ,  cried she , has been the cause of a great misfortune! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his leg . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take the good - for - nothing fellow out of our house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the father was terrified , and ran thither and scolded the boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  father ,  he replied , do listen to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am quite innocent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was standing there by night like one intent on doing evil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did not know who it was , and i entreated him three times either to speak or to go away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  ah ,  said the father , i have nothing but unhappiness with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go out of my sight . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> yes , father , right willingly , wait only until it is day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then will i go forth and learn how to shudder , and then i shall , at any rate , understand one art which will support me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  learn what you will ,  spoke the father , it is all the same to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  yes , father , it shall be as you will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you desire nothing more than that , i can easily keep it in mind . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when the day dawned , therefore , the boy put his fifty talers into his pocket , and went forth on the great highway , and continually said to himself: if i could but shudder! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i could but shudder!   then a man approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with himself , and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see the gallows , the man said to him: look , there is the tree where seven men have married the ropemaker s daughter , and are now learning how to fly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sit down beneath it , and wait till night comes , and you will soon learn how to shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  if that is all that is wanted ,  answered the youth , it is easily done; but if i learn how to shudder as fast as that , you shall have my fifty talers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just come back to me early in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other , and they moved backwards and forwards , he thought to himself: if you shiver below by the fire , how those up above must freeze and suffer!   and as he felt pity for them , he raised the ladder , and climbed up , unbound one of them after the other , and brought down all seven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he stoked the fire , blew it , and set them all round it to warm themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he said: take care , or i will hang you up again . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep , and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have the fifty talers , and said: well do you know how to shudder?   no ,  answered he , how should i know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those fellows up there did not open their mouths , and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodies get burnt . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the youth likewise went his way , and once more began to mutter to himself: ah , if i could but shudder! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , if i could but shudder!   a waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: who are you?   i don t know ,  answered the youth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the waggoner asked: from whence do you come?   i know not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  who is your father?   that i may not tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the youth went with the waggoner , and in the evening they arrived at an inn where they wished to pass the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then at the entrance of the parlour the youth again said quite loudly: if i could but shudder! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i could but shudder!   the host who heard this , laughed and said: if that is your desire , there ought to be a good opportunity for you here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  ah , be silent ,  said the hostess , so many prying persons have already lost their lives , it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> but the youth said: however difficult it may be , i will learn it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for this purpose indeed have i journeyed forth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he let the host have no rest , until the latter told him , that not far from thence stood a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was , if he would but watch in it for three nights . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> likewise in the castle lay great treasures , which were guarded by evil spirits , and these treasures would then be freed , and would make a poor man rich enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> already many men had gone into the castle , but as yet none had come out again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the youth went next morning to the king , and said: if it be allowed , i will willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the king looked at him , and as the youth pleased him , he said: you may ask for three things to take into the castle with you , but they must be things without life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he answered: then i ask for a fire , a turning lathe , and a cutting - board with the knife . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the king had these things carried into the castle for him during the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when night was drawing near , the youth went up and made himself a bright fire in one of the rooms , placed the cutting - board and knife beside it , and seated himself by the turning - lathe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , if i could but shudder!   said he , but i shall not learn it here either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  towards midnight he was about to poke his fire , and as he was blowing it , something cried suddenly from one corner: au , miau! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you are cold , come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and when he had said that , two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him , and looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a short time , when they had warmed themselves , they said: comrade , shall we have a game of cards?   why not?   he replied , but just show me your paws . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then they stretched out their claws . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wait , i must first cut them for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  thereupon he seized them by the throats , put them on the cutting - board and screwed their feet fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have looked at your fingers ,  said he , and my fancy for card - playing has gone ,  and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when he had made away with these two , and was about to sit down again by his fire , out from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red - hot chains , and more and more of them came until he could no longer move , and they yelled horribly , and got on his fire , pulled it to pieces , and tried to put it out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he watched them for a while quietly , but at last when they were going too far , he seized his cutting - knife , and cried: away with you , vermin ,  and began to cut them down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some of them ran away , the others he killed , and threw out into the fish - pond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he came back he fanned the embers of his fire again and warmed himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as he thus sat , his eyes would keep open no longer , and he felt a desire to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he was just going to shut his eyes , however , the bed began to move of its own accord , and went over the whole of the castle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he threw quilts and pillows up in the air , got out and said: now anyone who likes , may drive ,  and lay down by his fire , and slept till it was day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the morning the king came , and when he saw him lying there on the ground , he thought the evil spirits had killed him and he was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then said he: after all it is a pity ,for so handsome a man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the king was astonished , but very glad , and asked how he had fared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you learnt how to shudder yet?   no ,  said he , it is all in vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then it was quiet for a while , and at length with a loud scream , half a man came down the chimney and fell before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hullo!   cried he , another half belongs to this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wait ,  said he , i will just stoke up the fire a little for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when he had done that and looked round again , the two pieces were joined together , and a hideous man was sitting in his place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is no part of our bargain ,  said the youth , the bench is mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the man wanted to push him away; the youth , however , would not allow that , but thrust him off with all his strength , and seated himself again in his own place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then still more men fell down , one after the other; they brought nine dead men s legs and two skulls , and set them up and played at nine - pins with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the youth also wanted to play and said: listen you , can i join you?   yes , if you have any money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  money enough ,  replied he , but your balls are not quite round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurrah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now we ll have fun!   he played with them and lost some of his money , but when it struck twelve , everything vanished from his sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he lay down and quietly fell asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> next morning the king came to inquire after him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how has it fared with you this time?   asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  have you not shuddered then?   what?   said he , i have had a wonderful time! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i did but know what it was to shudder!  <s> <s> the third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly: if i could but shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when it grew late , six tall men came in and brought a coffin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he said: ha , ha , that is certainly my little cousin , who died only a few days ago ,  and he beckoned with his finger , and cried: come , little cousin , come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  they placed the coffin on the ground , but he went to it and took the lid off , and a dead man lay therein . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt his face , but it was cold as ice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he took him out , and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his arms that the blood might circulate again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as this also did no good , he thought to himself: when two people lie in bed together , they warm each other ,  and carried him to the bed , covered him over and lay down by him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a short time the dead man became warm too , and began to move . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> what!   said he , is that the way you thank me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you shall at once go into your coffin again ,  and he took him up , threw him into it , and shut the lid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then came the six men and carried him away again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot manage to shudder ,  said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall never learn it here as long as i live . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then a man entered who was taller than all others , and looked terrible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you wretch ,  cried he , you shall soon learn what it is to shudder , for you shall die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  not so fast ,  replied the youth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i will soon seize you ,  said the fiend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> softly , softly , do not talk so big . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  we shall see ,  said the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you are stronger , i will let you gocome , we will try . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can do better than that ,  said the youth , and went to the other anvil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man placed himself near and wanted to look on , and his white beard hung down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now i have you ,  said the youth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now it is your turn to die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the youth drew out the axe and let him go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall still be able to find my way out ,  said he , and felt about , found the way into the room , and slept there by his fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> next morning the king came and said: now you must have learnt what shuddering is?   no ,  he answered; what can it be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dead cousin was here , and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below , but no one told me what it was to shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then ,  said the king , you have saved the castle , and shall marry my daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that is all very well ,  said he , but still i do not know what it is to shudder!  <s> <s> then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever much the young king loved his wife , and however happy he was , he still said always: if i could but shudderif i could but shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she went out to the stream which flowed through the garden , and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons brought to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at night when the young king was sleeping , his wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water with the gudgeons in it over him , so that the little fishes would sprawl about him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he woke up and cried: oh , what makes me shudder so? what makes me shudder so , dear wife? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now i know what it is to shudder!  <s> <s> a great king of a land far away in the east had a daughter who was very beautiful , but so proud , and haughty , and conceited , that none of the princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her , and she only made sport of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first was too fat: he s as round as a tub ,  said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next was too tall: what a maypole!   said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fourth was too pale , and she called him wallface . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a green stick , that had been laid to dry over a baker s oven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a good king who was there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look at him ,  said she; his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called grisly - beard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the king got the nickname of grisly - beard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved , and how she ill - treated all his guests; and he vowed that , willing or unwilling , she should marry the first man , be he prince or beggar , that came to the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for , and she was married to the fiddler . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then the fiddler went his way , and took her with him , and they soon came to a great wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray ,  said she , whose is this wood?   it belongs to king grisly - beard ,  answered he; hadst thou taken him , all had been thine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unlucky wretch that i am!   sighed she; would that i had married king grisly - beard!   next they came to some fine meadows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unlucky wretch that i am!   said she; would that i had married king grisly - beard!  <s> <s> then they came to a great city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whose is this noble city?   said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it belongs to king grisly - beard; hadst thou taken him , it had all been thine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wretch that i am!   sighed she; why did i not marry king grisly - beard?   that is no business of mine ,  said the fiddler: why should you wish for another husband? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> am not i good enough for you?  <s> <s> at last they came to a small cottage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a paltry place!   said she; to whom does that little dirty hole belong?   then the fiddler said , that is your and my house , where we are to live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  where are your servants?   cried she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do we want with servants?   said he; you must do for yourself whatever is to be done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the princess knew nothing of making fires and cooking , and the fiddler was forced to help her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage , the man said , wife , we can t go on thus , spending money and earning nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must learn to weave baskets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he went out and cut willows , and brought them home , and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i see this work won t do ,  said he: try and spin; perhaps you will do that better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see now ,  said the fiddler , you are good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain i have got! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , i ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans , and you shall stand in the market and sell them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  alas!   sighed she , if any of my father s court should pass by and see me standing in the market , how they will laugh at me!  <s> <s> but her husband did not care for that , and said she must work , if she did not wish to die of hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at first the trade went well; for many people , seeing such a beautiful woman , went to buy her wares , and paid their money without thinking of taking away the goods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who would have thought you would have been so silly ,  said he , as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the market , where everybody passes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but let us have no more crying; i see you are not fit for this sort of work , so i have been to the king s palace , and asked if they did not want a kitchen - maid; and they say they will take you , and there you will have plenty to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had not been there long before she heard that the king s eldest son was passing by , going to be married; and she went to one of the windows and looked out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything was ready , and all the pomp and brightness of the court was there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the servants gave her some of the rich meats , which she put into her basket to take home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , he kept fast hold , and led her in; and the cover of the basket came off , so that the meats in it fell about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps king grisly - beard overtook her , and brought her back and said , fear me not! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i brought you there because i really loved you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and her father and his whole court were there already , and welcomed her home on her marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and i only wish that you and i had been of the party . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his palace , full of all kinds of wild animals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps some accident has befallen him ,  said the king , and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him , but they too stayed away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then on the third day , he sent for all his huntsmen , and said: scour the whole forest through , and do not give up until you have found all three . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but of these also , none came home again , none were seen again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from that time forth , no one would any longer venture into the forest , and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude , and nothing was seen of it , but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this lasted for many years , when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation , and offered to go into the dangerous forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king , however , would not give his consent , and said: it is not safe in there; i fear it would fare with you no better than with the others , and you would never come out again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the huntsman replied: lord , i will venture it at my own risk , of fear i know nothing . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the huntsman saw that , he went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron , and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they bound him with cords , and led him away to the castle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was great astonishment over the wild man; the king , however , had him put in an iron cage in his courtyard , and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death , and the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and from this time forth everyone could again go into the forest with safety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king had a son of eight years , who was once playing in the courtyard , and while he was playing , his golden ball fell into the cage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boy ran thither and said: give me my ball out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: open my door ,  but the boy would not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the third day the king had ridden out hunting , and the boy went once more and said: i cannot open the door even if i wished , for i have not the key . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the wild man said: it lies under your mother s pillow , you can get it there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the boy , who wanted to have his ball back , cast all thought to the winds , and brought the key . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door opened with difficulty , and the boy pinched his fingers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: oh , wild man , do not go away , or i shall be beaten!   the wild man turned back , took him up , set him on his shoulder , and went with hasty steps into the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the king came home , he observed the empty cage , and asked the queen how that had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she knew nothing about it , and sought the key , but it was gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she called the boy , but no one answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king sent out people to seek for him in the fields , but they did not find him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he could easily guess what had happened , and much grief reigned in the royal court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the wild man had once more reached the dark forest , he took the boy down from his shoulder , and said to him: you will never see your father and mother again , but i will keep you with me , for you have set me free , and i have compassion on you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you do all i bid you , you shall fare well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept , and the next morning the man took him to a well , and said: behold , the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal , you shall sit beside it , and take care that nothing falls into it , or it will be polluted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the boy placed himself by the brink of the well , and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein , and took care that nothing fell in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he drew it quickly out again , but saw that it was quite gilded , and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again , all was to no purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the evening iron hans came back , looked at the boy , and said: what has happened to the well?   nothing nothing ,  he answered , and held his finger behind his back , that the man might not see it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he said: you have dipped your finger into the water , this time it may pass , but take care you do not again let anything go in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  by daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head , and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took it quickly out , but it was already quite gilded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> iron hans came , and already knew what had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have let a hair fall into the well ,  said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he raised himself up quickly , but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can imagine how terrified the poor boy was! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took his pocket - handkerchief and tied it round his head , in order that the man might not see it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he came he already knew everything , and said: take the handkerchief off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the golden hair streamed forth , and let the boy excuse himself as he might , it was of no use . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have not stood the trial and can stay here no longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go forth into the world , there you will learn what poverty is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as you have not a bad heart , and as i mean well by you , there is one thing i will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty , come to the forest and cry:  - iron hans , and then i will come and help you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my power is great , greater than you think , and i have gold and silver in abundance . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> then the king s son left the forest , and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there he looked for work , but could find none , and he learnt nothing by which he could help himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length he went to the palace , and asked if they would take him in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him , but they liked him , and told him to stay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length the cook took him into his service , and said he might carry wood and water , and rake the cinders together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once when it so happened that no one else was at hand , the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table , but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen , he kept his little cap on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such a thing as that had never yet come under the king s notice , and he said: when you come to the royal table you must take your hat off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he answered: ah , lord , i cannot; i have a bad sore place on my head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the king had the cook called before him and scolded him , and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to send him away at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cook , however , had pity on him , and exchanged him for the gardener s boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once in summer when he was working alone in the garden , the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she saw the boy , and cried to him: boy , bring me a wreath of flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he put his cap on with all haste , and gathered wild field - flowers and bound them together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  oh , no ,  replied the boy , the wild ones have more scent , and will please her better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when he got into the room , the king s daughter said: take your cap off , it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he again said: i may not , i have a sore head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wanted to run out , but she held him by the arm , and gave him a handful of ducats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these he departed , but he cared nothing for the gold pieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took them to the gardener , and said: i present them to your children , they can play with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the following day the king s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field - flowers , and then he went in with it , she instantly snatched at his cap , and wanted to take it away from him , but he held it fast with both hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she again gave him a handful of ducats , but he would not keep them , and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king gathered together his people , and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy , who was superior in strength and had a mighty army . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then said the gardener s boy: i am grown up , and will go to the wars also , only give me a horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when they had gone forth , he went into the stable , and led the horse out; it was lame of one foot , and limped hobblety jib , hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it , and rode away to the dark forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he came to the outskirts , he called iron hans  three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that you shall have , and still more than you ask for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then the wild man went back into the forest , and it was not long before a stable - boy came out of it , who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils , and could hardly be restrained , and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron , and their swords flashed in the sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the youth made over his three - legged horse to the stable - boy , mounted the other , and rode at the head of the soldiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers , broke like a hurricane over the enemy , and beat down all who opposed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they began to flee , but the youth pursued , and never stopped , until there was not a single man left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of returning to the king , however , he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest , and called forth iron hans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do you desire?   asked the wild man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take back your horse and your troops , and give me my three - legged horse again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  all that he asked was done , and soon he was riding on his three - legged horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not the one who carried away the victory ,  said he , but a strange knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was , but the king did not know , and said: he followed the enemy , and i did not see him again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  she inquired of the gardener where his boy was , but he smiled , and said: he has just come home on his three - legged horse , and the others have been mocking him , and crying:  - here comes our hobblety jib back again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he said:  - i did the best of all , and it would have gone badly without me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the king said to his daughter: i will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days , and you shall throw a golden apple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps the unknown man will show himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the feast was announced , the youth went out to the forest , and called iron hans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that i may catch the king s daughter s golden apple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  it is as safe as if you had it already ,  said iron hans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when the day came , the youth galloped to the spot , took his place amongst the knights , and was recognized by no one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king s daughter came forward , and threw a golden apple to the knights , but none of them caught it but he , only as soon as he had it he galloped away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the second day iron hans equipped him as a white knight , and gave him a white horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again he was the only one who caught the apple , and he did not linger an instant , but galloped off with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king grew angry , and said: that is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple , should go away again they should pursue him , and if he would not come back willingly , they were to cut him down and stab him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the third day , he received from iron hans a suit of black armour and a black horse , and again he caught the apple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the youth nevertheless escaped from them , but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth s head , and they could see that he had golden hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the festival too , and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the king had him summoned into his presence , and he came and again had his little cap on his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the king s daughter went up to him and took it off , and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders , and he was so handsome that all were amazed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes ,  answered he , and here the apples are ,  and he took them out of his pocket , and returned them to the king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you desire further proof , you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  if you can perform such deeds as that , you are no gardener s boy; tell me , who is your father?   my father is a mighty king , and gold have i in plenty as great as i require . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i well see ,  said the king , that i owe my thanks to you; can i do anything to please you?   yes ,  answered he , that indeed you can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give me your daughter to wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the maiden laughed , and said: he does not stand much on ceremony , but i have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener s boy ,  and then she went and kissed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as they were sitting at the marriage - feast , the music suddenly stopped , the doors opened , and a stately king came in with a great retinue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went up to the youth , embraced him and said: i am iron hans , and was by enchantment a wild man , but you have set me free; all the treasures which i possess , shall be your property . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> there was once a king , whose queen had hair of the purest gold , and was so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of the earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then when the king in his grief promised all she asked , she shut her eyes and died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the king was not to be comforted , and for a long time never thought of taking another wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last , however , his wise men said , this will not do; the king must marry again , that we may have a queen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the messengers came home , and had had all their trouble for nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when she was grown up , the king looked at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his courtiers , may i not marry my daughter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is the very image of my dead wife: unless i have her , i shall not find any bride upon the whole earth , and you say there must be a queen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and thus she thought he would think of the matter no more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when all were ready , the king sent them to her; but she got up in the night when all were asleep , and took three of her trinkets , a golden ring , a golden necklace , and a golden brooch , and packed the three dressesof the sun , the moon , and the starsup in a nutshell , and wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur , and besmeared her face and hands with soot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she threw herself upon heaven for help in her need , and went away , and journeyed on the whole night , till at last she came to a large wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she was very tired , she sat herself down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept on till it was midday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look sharp!   said the king to the huntsmen , and see what sort of game lies there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  see ,  said the king , if you can catch it alive , and we will take it with us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the huntsmen took it up , and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened , and said , i am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on me and take me with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then they said , yes , miss cat - skin , you will do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes , and do things of that sort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they put her into the coach , and took her home to the king s palace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus cat - skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and the cook said , yes , you may go , but be back again in half an hour s time , to rake out the ashes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she next opened her nutshell , and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun , and so went to the feast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the king came up to her , and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart , i never saw any one half so beautiful . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round for her , she was gone , no one knew wither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the guards that stood at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she went into the kitchen to her work , and began to rake the ashes , the cook said , let that alone till the morning , and heat the king s soup; i should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don t let a hair fall into it , or you will run a chance of never eating again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the dance was over , the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well , that he thought he had never tasted any so good before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the bottom he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there , he ordered the cook to be sent for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cook was frightened when he heard the order , and said to cat - skin , you must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so , you will have a good beating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did ,  answered the cook . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then he answered , to tell the truth i did not cook it , but cat - skin did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then let cat - skin come up ,  said the king: and when she came he said to her , who are you?   i am a poor child ,  said she , that has lost both father and mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  how came you in my palace?   asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am good for nothing ,  said she , but to be scullion - girl , and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she would not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent her away again about her business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a time there was another feast , and cat - skin asked the cook to let her go up and see it as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then she ran to her little cabin , washed herself quickly , and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon , and put it on; and when she went in , looking like a king s daughter , the king went up to her , and rejoiced at seeing her again , and when the dance began he danced with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after the dance was at an end she managed to slip out , so slyly that the king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin , and made herself into cat - skin again , and went into the kitchen to cook the soup . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whilst the cook was above stairs , she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king , who ate it , and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook , who was again forced to tell him that cat - skin had cooked it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cat - skin was brought again before the king , but she still told him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third time , it happened just the same as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must be a witch , cat - skin ,  said the cook; for you always put something into your soup , so that it pleases the king better than mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  however , he let her go up as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars , and went into the ball - room in it; and the king danced with her again , and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so whilst he was dancing with her , he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it , and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she ran into the kitchen , and cooked the king s soup; and as soon as the cook was gone , she put the golden brooch into the dish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the king got to the bottom , he ordered cat - skin to be called once more , and soon saw the white finger , and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand , and kept fast hold of it , and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away , the fur cloak fell off a little on one side , and the starry dress sparkled underneath it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he got hold of the fur and tore it off , and her golden hair and beautiful form were seen , and she could no longer hide herself: so she washed the soot and ashes from her face , and showed herself to be the most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the king said , you are my beloved bride , and we will never more be parted from each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and the wedding feast was held , and a merry day it was , as ever was heard of or seen in that country , or indeed in any other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose - trees , one of which bore white and the other red roses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had two children who were like the two rose - trees , and one was called snow - white , and the other rose - red . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were as good and happy , as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were , only snow - white was more quiet and gentle than rose - red . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose - red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but snow - white sat at home with her mother , and helped her with her housework , or read to her when there was nothing to do . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> they often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries , and no beasts did them any harm , but came close to them trustfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest , and night came on , they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss , and slept until morning came , and their mother knew this and did not worry on their account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them , they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the summer rose - red took care of the house , and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother s bed before she awoke , in which was a rose from each tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the winter snow - white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the kettle was of brass and shone like gold , so brightly was it polished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the evening , when the snowflakes fell , the mother said: go , snow - white , and bolt the door ,  and then they sat round the hearth , and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book , and the two girls listened as they sat and spun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one evening , as they were thus sitting comfortably together , someone knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mother said: quick , rose - red , open the door , it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  rose - red went and pushed back the bolt , thinking that it was a poor man , but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad , black head within the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose - red screamed and sprang back , the lamb bleated , the dove fluttered , and snow - white hid herself behind her mother s bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the bear began to speak and said: do not be afraid , i will do you no harm! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am half - frozen , and only want to warm myself a little beside you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> poor bear ,  said the mother , lie down by the fire , only take care that you do not burn your coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so they both came out , and by - and - by the lamb and dove came nearer , and were not afraid of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they tugged his hair with their hands , put their feet upon his back and rolled him about , or they took a hazel - switch and beat him , and when he growled they laughed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the bear took it all in good part , only when they were too rough he called out: leave me alive , children ,<s> <s> when it was bed - time , and the others went to bed , the mother said to the bear: you can lie there by the hearth , and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  as soon as day dawned the two children let him out , and he trotted across the snow into the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when spring had come and all outside was green , the bear said one morning to snow - white: now i must go away , and cannot come back for the whole summer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  where are you going , then , dear bear?   asked snow - white . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> snow - white was quite sorry at his departure , and as she unbolted the door for him , and the bear was hurrying out , he caught against the bolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off , and it seemed to snow - white as if she had seen gold shining through it , but she was not sure about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bear ran away quickly , and was soon out of sight behind the trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to get firewood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground , and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the grass , but they could not make out what it was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow - white beard a yard long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: why do you stand there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can you not come here and help me?   what are you up to , little man?   asked rose - red . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you stupid , prying goose!   answered the dwarf: i was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse , greedy folk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ugh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how odious you are!  <s> <s> the children tried very hard , but they could not pull the beard out , it was caught too fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you senseless goose!   snarled the dwarf; why should you fetch someone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?   don t be impatient ,  said snow - white , i will help you ,  and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket , and cut off the end of the beard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bad luck to you!   and then he swung the bag upon his back , and went off without even once looking at the children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some time afterwards snow - white and rose - red went to catch a dish of fish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they ran to it and found it was the dwarf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where are you going?   said rose - red; you surely don t want to go into the water?   i am not such a fool!   cried the dwarf; don t you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?   the little man had been sitting there fishing , and unluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing - line; a moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his beard from the line , but all in vain , beard and line were entangled fast together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now you have cut off the best part of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot let myself be seen by my people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!   then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes , and without another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the town to buy needles and thread , and laces and ribbons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there they noticed a large bird hovering in the air , flying slowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower , and at last settled near a rock not far away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> immediately they heard a loud , piteous cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill voice: could you not have done it more carefully! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes , you clumsy creatures!   then he took up a sack full of precious stones , and slipped away again under the rock into his hole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why do you stand gaping there?   cried the dwarf , and his ashen - grey face became copper - red with rage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dwarf sprang up in a fright , but he could not reach his cave , for the bear was already close . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then in the dread of his heart he cried: dear mr bear , spare me , i will give you all my treasures; look , the beautiful jewels lying there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grant me my life; what do you want with such a slender little fellow as i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you would not feel me between your teeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , take these two wicked girls , they are tender morsels for you , fat as young quails; for mercy s sake eat them!   the bear took no heed of his words , but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw , and he did not move again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girls had run away , but the bear called to them: snow - white and rose - red , do not be afraid; wait , i will come with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then they recognized his voice and waited , and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin fell off , and he stood there a handsome man , clothed all in gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am a king s son ,  he said , and i was bewitched by that wicked dwarf , who had stolen my treasures; i have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until i was freed by his death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now he has got his well - deserved punishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> snow - white was married to him , and rose - red to his brother , and they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered together in his cave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old mother lived peacefully and happily with her children for many years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she took the two rose - trees with her , and they stood before her window , and every year bore the most beautiful roses , white and red . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> throughout their lives they remained close friends , and both studied law at marburg university . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but they were best ( and universally ) known for the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral sources and published in two volumes of nursery and household tales  in 1812 and 1814 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although their intention was to preserve such material as part of german cultural and literary history , and their collection was first published with scholarly notes and no illustration , the tales soon came into the possession of young readers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  they have been an essential ingredient of children s reading ever since . </s> </s>
