<s> <s> it is the larger , the more varied , the more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather more of the world , and had improved her general , though not her most peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as miss bates , as the eltons , cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody . </s> </s>

<s> <s> collins is really great; far greater than anything addison ever did , almost great enough for fielding or for swift himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in the first{xvii} place , he was like him; he is therealive , imperishable , more real than hundreds of prime ministers and archbishops , of  - metals , semi - metals , and distinguished philosophers . </s> </s>

<s> <s> collins himself , has been charged with exaggeration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is , perhaps , a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me very faint indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even now i do not think that it would be impossible to find persons , especially female persons , not necessarily of noble birth , as overbearing , as{xviii} self - centred , as neglectful of good manners , as lady catherine . </s> </s>

<s> <s> his wife was evidently , and must always have been , a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but the ironic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from no other point of view is he open to any reproach , except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of the elopement , and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the consciously humorous kindin the kind that we laugh with , not atthat even miss austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins through his paces; but the general sense of the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail ,  - my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . </s> </s>

<s> <s> collins has just related as made by himself to lady catherine ,  - may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment ,{xix} or are the result of previous study? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these are the things which give miss austen s readers the pleasant shocks , the delightful thrills , which are felt by the readers of swift , of fielding , and we may here add , of thackeray , as they are felt by the readers of no other english author of fiction outside of these four . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet we have glanced at , and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> much the same may be said of kitty and lydia; but it is not every author , even of genius , who would have differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common weaknesses of woman at such different ages . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it is at any rate difficult not to extend to her a share of the respect and affection ( affection and respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless ) , with which one regards mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i{xx} sometimes wish that the exigencies of the story had permitted miss austen to unite these personages , and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe poor mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s anguish over the entail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bingleys and the gardiners and the lucases , miss darcy and miss de bourgh , jane , wickham , and the rest , must pass without special comment , further than the remark that charlotte lucas ( her egregious papa , though delightful , is just a little on the thither side of the line between comedy and farce ) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind , and that wickham ( though something of miss austen s hesitation of touch in dealing with young men appears ) is a not much less notable sketch in drab of another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only genius could have made charlotte what she is , yet not disagreeable; wickham what he is , without investing him either with a cheap don juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of miss austen s heroes; the only possible competitor being henry tilney , whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into comparison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here again i cannot go with the objectors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s own account of the way in which his pride had been pampered , is perfectly rational and sufficient; and nothing could be , psychologically speaking , a causa verior for its sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of elizabeth s scornful refusal acting on a nature{xxi} ex hypothesi generous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his being neither is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense , but not really injured in disposition , and thoroughly in love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for his being in love , elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that phenomenon as darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state , only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal charm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the secret of that charm many men and not a few women , from miss austen herself downwards , have felt , and like most charms it is a thing rather to be felt than to be explained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth of course belongs to the allegro or allegra division of the army of venus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss austen was always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and except the fine eyes , and a hint or two that she had at any rate sometimes a bright complexion , and was not very tall , we hear nothing about her looks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but her chief difference from other heroines of the lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly cleveralmost strong - minded , in the better sense of that objectionable wordand secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill - nature for all her propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth can give at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never  - scratches , and she never attacks first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some of the merest obsoletenesses of phrase and{xxii} manner give one or two of her early speeches a slight pertness , but that is nothing , and when she comes to serious business , as in the great proposal scene with darcy ( which is , as it should be , the climax of the interest of the book ) , and in the final ladies  battle with lady catherine , she is unexceptionable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she does not disguise from herself or anybody that she resents darcy s first ill - mannered personality with as personal a feeling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ( by the way , the reproach that the ill - manners of this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same kind , expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely , might have been heard in more than one ball - room during this very year from persons who ought to have been no worse bred than darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , all this does not explain her charm , which , taking beauty as a common form of all heroines , may perhaps consist in the addition to her playfulness , her wit , her affectionate and natural disposition , of a certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent darcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the idea of proposals , even naughty ones , from the fascinating wickham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , with nothing offensive , nothing viraginous , nothing of the  - new woman about her , has by nature what the best modern ( not  - new ) women have by education and experience , a perfect freedom from the idea that all men may bully her if they choose , and that most will{xxiii} away with her if they can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though not in the least  - impudent and mannish grown , she has no mere sensibility , no nasty niceness about her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the form of passion common and likely to seem natural in miss austen s day was so invariably connected with the display of one or the other , or both of these qualities , that she has not made elizabeth outwardly passionate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , after all , what is the good of seeking for the reason of charm? it is there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were better sense in the sad mechanic exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at least five with whom , as it seems to me , no man of taste and spirit can help doing so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should have been most in love with beatrix and argemone; i should , i think , for mere occasional companionship , have preferred diana and barbara . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to live with and to marry , i do not know that any one of the four can come into competition with elizabeth . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the girls grieved over such a number of{13} ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that , instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room: he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such amiable qualities must speak for themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a contrast between him and his friend! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy danced only once with mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and everybody hoped that he would never come there again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> amongst the most violent against him was mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters . </s> </s>

<s> <s> darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , darcy , said he ,  - i must have you dance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you had much better dance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i certainly shall not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner . </s> </s>

<s> <s> upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening; and there are several of them , you see , uncommonly pretty . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till , catching her eye , he withdrew his own , and coldly said ,  - she is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt me; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they returned , therefore , in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they found mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet still up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a book , he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my dear mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , as she entered the room ,  - we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wish you had been there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everybody said how well she looked; and mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> for god s sake , say no more of his partners . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my dear , continued mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet ,  - i am quite delighted with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is so excessively handsome! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and his sisters are charming women . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst s gown<s> <s> here she was interrupted again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet protested against any description of finery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit , and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i can assure you , she added ,  - that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so high and so conceited , that there was no enduring him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not handsome enough to dance with! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set - downs . </s> </s> 
{18}<s> <s> hen jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so much ease , with such perfect good breeding! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is also handsome , replied elizabeth ,  - which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his character is thereby complete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did not expect such a compliment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did not you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but that is one great difference between us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> compliments always take you by surprise , and me never . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what could be more natural than his asking you again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no thanks to his gallantry for that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dear lizzy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but i always speak what i think . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it everywhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to be candid without ostentation or design ,to take the good of everybody s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad ,belongs to you alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so , you like this man s sisters , too , do you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their manners are not equal to his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly not , at first; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced: their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment , too , unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank; and were , therefore , in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were of a respectable family in the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county; but , as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted , by an accidental recommendation , to look at netherfield house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did look at it , and into it , for half an hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> between him and darcy there was a very steady{21} friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , and ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the strength of darcy s regard , bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious; and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; darcy was continually giving offence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose . </s> </s> 
{22}<s> <s> ithin a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune , and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the distinction had , perhaps , been felt too strongly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for , though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary , he was all attention to everybody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had several children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty - seven , was elizabeth s intimate friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you began the evening well , charlotte , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , with civil self - command , to miss lucas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you were mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley s first choice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> robinson . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and his answering immediately to the last question , oh , the eldest miss bennet , beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - upon my word! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , that was very decided , indeedthat does seem as ifbut , however , it may all come to nothing , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor eliza! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - without once opening his lips<s> <s>  - are you quite sure , ma am? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is not there a little mistake? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said jane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i certainly saw mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy speaking to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not believe a word of it , my dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - another time , lizzy , said her mother ,  - i would not dance with him , if i were you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his pride , said miss lucas ,  - does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is very true , replied elizabeth ,  - and i could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pride , observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections ,  - is a very common failing , i believe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often{26} used synonymously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a person may be proud without being vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i were as rich as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , cried a young lucas , who came with his sisters ,  - i should not care how proud i was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet;  - and if i were to see you at it , i should take away your bottle directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would; and the argument ended only with the visit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> {27}<s> <s> he ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the visit was returned in due form . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable , and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them; though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value , as arising , in all probability , from the influence of their brother s admiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was generally evident , whenever they met , that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard{28} her from the suspicions of the impertinent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it may , perhaps , be pleasant , replied charlotte ,  - to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - remember , eliza , that he does not know jane s disposition as you do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavor to conceal it , he must find it out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . </s> </s> 
{29}<s> <s>  - your plan is a good one , replied elizabeth ,  - where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but these are not jane s feelings; she is not acting by design . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she has known him only a fortnight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is not quite enough to make her understand his character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not as you represent it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt - un better than commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said charlotte ,  - i wish jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to - morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . </s> </s> 
{30}<s> <s>  - you make me laugh , charlotte; but it is not sound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> occupied in observing mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he began to wish to know more of her; and , as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his doing so drew her notice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was at sir william lucas s , where a large party were assembled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what does mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy mean , said she to charlotte ,  - by listening to my conversation with colonel forster? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is a question which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy only can answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but if he does it any more , i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has a very{31} satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said ,<s> <s>  - did not you think , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it will be her turn soon to be teased , said miss lucas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on miss lucas s persevering , however , she added ,  - very well; if it must be so , it must . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and gravely glancing at mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy ,  - there is a very fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar withkeep your breath to cool your porridge , and i shall keep mine to swell my song . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well; and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases , and two or three officers , joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room . </s> </s> 
{33}<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is nothing like dancing , after all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sir william only smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you often dance at st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> james s? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have a house in town , i conclude? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself , for i am fond of superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the{34} notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her ,<s> <s>  - my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy is all politeness , said elizabeth , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is , indeed: but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth looked archly , and turned away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are considering how insupportable it would be{35} to pass many evenings in this manner ,in such society; and , indeed , i am quite of your opinion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the insipidity , and yet the noisethe nothingness , and yet the self - importance , of all these people! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what would i give to hear your strictures on them! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my mind was more agreeably engaged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am all astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how long has she been such a favourite? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and pray when am i to wish you joy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a lady s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony , in a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed , in default of heirs male , on a distant relation; and their mother s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her father had been an{37} attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt , and to a milliner s shop just over the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions: their minds were more vacant than their sisters  , and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and , however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes; but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they get to our age , i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read ,<s> <s>  - well , jane , who is it from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is it about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what does he say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is from miss bingley , said jane , and then read it aloud . </s> </s>

<s> <s> cried lydia:  - i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dining out , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can i have the carriage? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said jane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that would be a good scheme , said elizabeth ,  - if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . </s> </s> 
{40}<s> <s>  - oh , but the gentlemen will have mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i had much rather go in the coach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are wanted in the farm , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , are not they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cheerful prognostics<s> <s>  - they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but if you have got them to - day , said elizabeth ,  - my mother s purpose will be answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it rained hard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rain continued the whole evening without intermission; jane certainly could not come back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dearest lizzie ,<s> <s>  - i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better . </s> </s>

<s> <s> jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand , excepting a sore throat and a headache , there is not much the matter with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yours , etc . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , my dear , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud ,  - if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif she should dieit would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i am not at all afraid of her dying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> people do{42} not die of little trifling colds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she will be taken good care of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as long as she stays there , it is all very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she declared her resolution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will not be fit to be seen when you get there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is this a hint to me , lizzy , said her father ,  - to send for the horses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not wish to avoid the walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the distance is nothing , when one has a motive; only three miles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall be back by dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i admire the activity of your benevolence , observed mary ,  - but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we will go as far as meryton with you , said catherine and lydia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers  wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles , with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise . </s> </s> 
{43}<s> <s> she was shown into the breakfast parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst and miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy said very little , and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter was thinking only of his breakfast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish , and not well enough to leave her room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was not equal , however , to much conversation; and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth silently attended her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the apothecary came; and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to{44} get the better of it; advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was despatched to longbourn , to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> {45}<s> <s> t five o clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half - past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards jane , when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who , when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst thought the same , and added ,<s> <s>  - she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she really looked almost wild . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she did indeed , louisa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> very nonsensical to come at all! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her hair so untidy , so blowzy! {47}<s> <s>  - yes , and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain , and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , i am sure , said miss bingley;  - and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what could she mean by it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , said bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am afraid , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not at all , he replied:  - they were brightened by the exercise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a short pause followed this speech , and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst began again ,<s> <s>  - i have an excessive regard for jane bennet ,she is really a very sweet girl ,and i wish with all my heart she were well settled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton? {48}<s> <s>  - yes; and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is capital , added her sister; and they both laughed heartily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , replied darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining - parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst looked at her with astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he;  - that is rather singular . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - miss eliza bennet , said miss bingley ,  - despises cards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , cried{49} elizabeth;  - i am not a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but i am an idle fellow; and though i have not many , i have more than i ever looked into . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it ought to be good , he replied:  - it has been the work of many generations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - neglect! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model . </s> </s> 
{50}<s> <s>  - with all my heart: i will buy pemberley itself , if darcy will sell it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is miss darcy much grown since the spring? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think she will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height , or rather taller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such a countenance , such manners , and so extremely accomplished for her age! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is amazing to me , said bingley ,  - how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all young ladies accomplished! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear charles , what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , all of them , i think . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they all paint tables , cover screens , and net purses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but i am very far{51} from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nor i , i am sure , said miss bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , certainly , cried his faithful assistant ,  - no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word; and , besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i rather wonder now at your knowing any . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never saw such a woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - eliza bennet , said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her ,  - is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men , i daresay , it succeeds; but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jones s being sent for immediately; while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in spite of this amendment ,{54} however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she would not listen , therefore , to her daughter s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley met them with hopes that mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed i have , sir , was her answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we must trespass a little longer on your kindness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - removed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it must not be thought of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may depend upon it , madam , said miss bingley , with cold civility ,  - that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sure , she added ,  - if it was not for such good friends , i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always{55} the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will not think of quitting it in a hurry , i hope , though you have but a short lease . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whatever i do is done in a hurry , replied he;  - and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , said elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh yesi understand you perfectly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lizzy , cried her mother ,  - remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it must be an amusing study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have at least that advantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the country , said darcy ,  - can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , indeed , cried mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everybody was surprised; and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph ,<s> <s>  - i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ay , that is because you have the right disposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but that gentleman , looking at darcy ,  - seemed to think the country was nothing at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , mamma , you are mistaken , said elizabeth , blushing for her mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you quite mistook mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , my dear , nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know we dine with four - and - twenty families . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy with a{57} very expressive smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , she called yesterday with her father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what an agreeable man sir william is , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingleyis not he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so much the man of fashion! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so genteel and so easy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has always something to say to everybody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did charlotte dine with you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for my part , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , i always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a pity they are not handsome! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not that i think charlotte so very plain; but then she is our particular friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she seems a very pleasant young woman , said bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh dear , yes; but you must own she is very plain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane s beauty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is what everybody says . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not trust my own partiality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , however , he did not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps he thought her too young . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , said darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything nourishes what is strong already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet began repeating her thanks to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia was a stout , well - grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good - humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self - consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle s good{59} dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was very equal , therefore , to address mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother s ear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement; and , when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well; and by that time , most likely , captain carter would be at meryton again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when you have given your ball , she added ,  - i shall insist on their giving one also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations  behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the loo table , however , did not appear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand - writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made no answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you write uncommonly fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> letters of business , too! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how odious i should think them! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pray tell your sister that i long to see her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am afraid you do not like your pen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me mend it for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i mend pens remarkably well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank youbut i always mend my own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at present i have not room to do them justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , it is of no consequence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall see her in january . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they are generally long; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline , cried her brother ,  - because he does not write with ease . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{62} he studies too much for words of four syllables . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my style of writing is very different from yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , said elizabeth ,  - must disarm reproof . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing is more deceitful , said darcy ,  - than the appearance of humility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you told mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet this morning , that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , cried bingley ,  - this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i{63} said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i daresay you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , bingley , you had better stay till next week ,  you would probably do ityou would probably not goand , at another word , might stay a month . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have shown him off now much more than he did himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am exceedingly gratified , said bingley ,  - by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if , under such a circumstance , i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - would mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , i cannot exactly explain the matterdarcy must speak for himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you appear to me , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by all means , cried bingley;  - let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size , for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions , and in{65} particular places; at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening , when he has nothing to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you dislike an argument , and want to silence this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps i do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> arguments are too much like disputes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what you ask , said elizabeth ,  - is no sacrifice on my side; and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy had much better finish his letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could only imagine , however , at last , that she drew his notice because there was something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she liked him too little to care for his approbation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her ,<s> <s>  - do you not feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she smiled , but made no answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you wanted me , i know , to say yes ,  that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you dare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed i do not dare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody , and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he really believed that , were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley saw , or suspected , enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope , said she , as they were walking together in{67} the shrubbery the next day ,  - you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it , to cure the younger girls of running after the officers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no; stay where you are<s> <s>  - have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity? {68}<s> <s>  - oh yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> put them next to your great - uncle the judge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression; but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst and elizabeth herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did not know that you intended to walk , said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you used us abominably ill , answered mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst ,  - running away without telling us that you were coming out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the path just admitted three . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy felt their rudeness , and immediately said ,<s> <s>  - this walk is not wide enough for our party . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we had better go into the avenue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered ,<s> <s>  - no , no; stay where you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good - bye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then ran gaily off , rejoicing , as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their powers of conversation were considerable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer{70} the first object; miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation; mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was  - very glad; but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to anyone else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst reminded his sister - in - law of the card - tablebut in vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy did not wish for cards , and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst soon found even his open petition rejected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst had , therefore , nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley did the same; and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s progress through his book , as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could not win him , however , to any conversation; he merely answered her question and read on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she{71} had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said ,  - how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i declare , after all , there is no enjoyment like reading! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one made any reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when , hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said ,<s> <s>  - by the bye charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should like balls infinitely better , she replied ,  - if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say; but it would not be near so much like a ball . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her figure was elegant , and she walked well; but darcy , at whom it was{72} all aimed , was still inflexibly studious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the desperation of her feelings , she resolved on one effort more; and , turning to elizabeth , said ,<s> <s>  - miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what could he mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was dying to know what could be his meaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy in anything , and persevered , therefore , in requiring an explanation of his two motives . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first , i should be completely in your way; and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , shocking! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried miss bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never heard{73} anything so abominable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how shall we punish him for such a speech? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , said elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we can all plague and punish one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , no; i feel he may defy us there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy may hug himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy is not to be laughed at! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i dearly love a laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - miss bingley , said he ,  - has given me credit for more than can be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wisest and best of men ,nay , the wisest and best of their actions ,may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , do divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps that is not possible for anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but pridewhere there is a real superiority of mindpride will be always under good regulation . </s> </s> 
{74}<s> <s> elizabeth turned away to hide a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy has no defect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he owns it himself without disguise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is , i believe , too little yielding; certainly too little for the convenience of the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my temper would perhaps be called resentful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is a failing , indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - implacable resentment is a shade in a character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but you have chosen your fault well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i really cannot laugh at it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are safe from me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do let us have a little music , cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention . </s> </s> 
{75}<s> <s> n consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth s wishes , for she was impatient to get home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy it was welcome intelligence: elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape himnothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that , if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday: and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to . </s> </s> 
{78}<s> <s> hope , my dear , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who do you mean , my dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know of nobody that is coming , i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in; and i hope my dinners are good enough for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not believe she often sees such at home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s eyes sparkled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a gentleman and a stranger! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , i am sure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , janeyou never dropped a word of thisyou sly thing! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how unlucky! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia , my love , ring the bell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must speak to hill this moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , said her husband;  - it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this roused a general astonishment; and he had the{79} pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is from my cousin , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my dear , cried his wife ,  - i cannot bear to hear that mentioned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it certainly is a most iniquitous affair , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet;  - and nothing can clear mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hate such false friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>there , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologize for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends; but of this hereafter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word; and , i doubt not , will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is some sense in what he says about the girls , however; and , if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - though it is difficult , said jane ,  - to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he must be an oddity , i think , said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i cannot make him out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is something very pompous in his style . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can he be a sensible man , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have great hopes of{82} finding him quite the reverse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in point of composition , said mary ,  - his letter does not seem defective . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for their mother , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s letter had done away much of her ill - will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a tall , heavy - looking young man of five - and - twenty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily ,<s> <s>  - you are very kind , sir , i am sure; and i wish with all{83} my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> things are settled so oddly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , sir , i do indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not that i mean to find fault with you , for such things , i know , are all chance in this world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at present i will not say more , but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted<s> <s> he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were not the only objects of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s admiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hall , the dining - room , and all its furniture , were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dinner , too , in its turn , was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but here he was set right by mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour . </s> </s> 
{84}<s> <s> uring dinner , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet could not have chosen better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people , he knew , but he had never seen anything but affability in her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally{85} for a week or two to visit his relations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is all very proper and civil , i am sure , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet ,  - and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> does she live near you , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship s residence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think you said she was a widow , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , cried mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what sort of young lady is she? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is she handsome? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is a most charming young lady , indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . </s> </s> 
{86}<s> <s>  - has she been presented? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not remember her name among the ladies at court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you judge very properly , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet;  - and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s expectations were fully answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and , except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure . </s> </s>

<s> <s> collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was{98} the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at first there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for anyone in particular . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> allowing for the common demands of the game , mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> her curiosity , how{99}ever , was unexpectedly relieved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham began the subject himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton; and , after receiving her answer , asked in a hesitating manner how long mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - about a month , said elizabeth; and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added ,  - he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied wickham;  - his estate there is a noble one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a clear ten thousand per annum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myselffor i have been connected with his family , in a particular manner , from my infancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth could not but look surprised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have no right to give my opinion , said wickham ,  - as to his being agreeable or otherwise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand , perhaps , you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wonder , said he , at the next opportunity of speaking ,  - whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not at all know; but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh noit is not for me to be driven away by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the worlda sense of very great ill - usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his father , miss bennet , the late mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be in company with this mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . </s> </s> 
{101}<s> <s> elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was the prospect of constant society , and good society , he added ,  - which was my chief inducement to enter the shire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps; and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> society , i own , is necessary to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must have employment and society . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the church ought to have been my professioni was brought up for the church; and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yesthe late mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot do justice to his kindness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how could his will be disregarded? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why did not you seek legal redress? {102}<s> <s>  - there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short , anything or nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have a warm unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can recall nothing worse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is quite shocking! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he deserves to be publicly disgraced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what can have induced him to behave so cruelly? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had the late mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better; but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him , i believe , very early in life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was often given me . </s> </s> 
{103}<s> <s>  - i had not thought mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his disposition must be dreadful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will not trust myself on the subject , replied wickham;  - i can hardly be just to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed ,  - to treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she contented herself with - and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we were born in the same parish , within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> philips , appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property . </s> </s>

<s> <s> darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendence; and when , immediately before my father s death , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy gave him a voluntary promise{104} of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how strange! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how abominable! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy has not made him just to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest ,for dishonesty i must call it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is wonderful , replied wickham;  - for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what sort of a girl is miss darcy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shook his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wish i could call her amiable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amuse{105}ment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she is nothing to me now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , i understand , highly accomplished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying ,<s> <s>  - i am astonished at his intimacy with mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can they suit each other? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - probably not; but mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy can please where he chooses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he does not want abilities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and , perhaps , agreeable ,allowing something for fortune and figure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know very well , madam , said he ,  - that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things ,and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same; but , thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lady catherine de bourgh , she replied ,  - has very lately given him a living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hardly know how mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , indeed , i did not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , said she ,  - speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but , from some particulars{107} that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i believe her to be both in a great degree , replied wickham;  - i have not seen her for many years; but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could think of nothing but of mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house . </s> </s> 
{108}<s> <s> lizabeth related to jane , the next day , what had passed between mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham and herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane listened with astonishment and concern: she knew not how to believe that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy could be so unworthy of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham . </s> </s> 
{109}<s> <s>  - they have both , said she ,  - been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very true , indeed; and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner ,one whom his father had promised to provide for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i can much more easily believe mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley s being imposed on than that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if it be not so , let mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy contradict it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is difficult , indeedit is distressing . </s> </s>

<s> <s> to the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s civilities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , however , did not choose to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . </s> </s>

<s> <s> if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time; for , from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once . </s> </s>

{113}<s> <s> ill elizabeth entered the drawing - room at netherfield , and looked in vain for mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her . </s> </s>

<s> <s> attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill - humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress: they were dances of mortification . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moment of her release from him was ecstasy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when those dances were over , she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well; that reply will do for the present . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps , by - and - by , i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but now we may be silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you talk by rule , then , while you are dancing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sometimes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet , for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - both , replied elizabeth archly;  - for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the clat of a proverb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you think it a faithful portrait , undoubtedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must not decide on my own performance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she{117} and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the effect was immediate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word; and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said ,<s> <s>  - mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his making friends; whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , replied elizabeth , with emphasis ,  - and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but , on perceiving mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , he stopped , with a bow of superior courtesy , to compliment him on his dancing and his partner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have been most highly gratified , indeed , my dear sir; such very superior dancing is not often seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you: and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza ( glancing at her sister and bingley ) , shall take place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what congratulations will then flow in! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy;but let me not interrupt you , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . </s> </s> 
{118}<s> <s>  - such very superior dancing is not often seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed , with a very serious expression , towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said ,<s> <s>  - sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what think you of books? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - noi cannot talk of books in a ball - room; my head is always full of something else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he , with a look of doubt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , always , she replied , without knowing what she said; for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming ,  - i remember hearing you once say , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , that you hardly ever forgave;that your resentment , once created , was unappeasable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being created? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am , said he , with a firm voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may i ask to what these questions tend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - merely to the illustration of your character , said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what is your success? {120}<s> <s> she shook her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not get on at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i can readily believe , answered he , gravely ,  - that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , he coldly replied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree; for in darcy s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and , with an expression of civil disdain , thus accosted her ,<s> <s>  - so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for , as to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy in a most infamous manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy is not in the least to{121} blame; that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite s guilt; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his guilt and his descent appear , by your account , to be the same , said elizabeth , angrily;  - for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i beg your pardon , replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excuse my interference; it was kindly meant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - insolent girl! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i want to know , said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s ,  - what you have learnt{122} about mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person , in which case you may be sure of my pardon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied jane ,  - i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham has deserved much less attention from mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s regard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley does not know mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am perfectly satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have not a doubt of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley s sincerity , said elizabeth warmly ,  - but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one , i dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying{123} to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on their being joined by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation , that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother , lady catherine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how wonderfully these sort of things occur! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are not going to introduce yourself to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed i am . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se nnight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus ,<s> <s>  - my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy; for , give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself; and with a low bow he left her to attack mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words  - apology ,  - hunsford , and  - lady catherine de bourgh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy was eyeing him with un{125}restrained wonder; and when at last mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way: mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have no reason , i assure you , said he ,  - to be dissatisfied with my reception . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon the whole , i am much pleased with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was an animating subject , and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet{126} seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self - gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and , lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , who sat opposite to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what advantage can it be to you to offend mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy? </s> </s> 
{127}<s> <s> nothing that she could say , however , had any influence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her , with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak , and her manner affected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was in agonies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took the hint , and , when mary had finished her second song , said aloud ,<s> <s>  - that will do extremely well , child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have delighted us long enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted; and elizabeth , sorry for her , and sorry for her father s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins ,  - were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rector of a parish has much to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well{129} of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many staredmany smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed , in a half - whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rest of the evening brought her little amusement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was teased by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he assured her that , as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was , by delicate attentions , to recommend himself to her; and that he{130} should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no arguing upon such a project . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good - naturedly engaged mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was at least free from the offence of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham , and rejoiced in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manuvre of mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet at conversation , and , by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy said nothing at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other . </s> </s>

{131}<s> <s> when at length they arose to take leave , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i am not now to learn , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , with a formal wave of the hand ,  - that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , sir , cried elizabeth ,  - your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am perfectly serious in my refusal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you could not make me happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - were it certain that lady catherine would think so , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , very gravely - but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins thus addressed her ,<s> <s>  - when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and , perhaps , you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , cried elizabeth , with some warmth ,  - you puzzle me exceedingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take{138} it into further consideration that , in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your portion is unhappily so small , that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as i must , therefore , conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my feelings in every respect forbid it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can i speak plainer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are uniformly charming! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry;  - and i am persuaded that , when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to such perseverance in wilful self - deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined , that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet: she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not believe it , and could not help saying so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but depend upon it , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest; but i will make her know it . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bennet , you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , for she vows she will not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her . </s> </s> 
{141}<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern , which was not in the least altered by her communication . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of what are you talking? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins and lizzy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - speak to lizzy about it yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let her be called down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have sent for you on an affair of importance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i understand that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins has made you an offer of marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it true? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth replied that it was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very welland this offer of marriage you have refused? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , and i will never see you again if you do . </s> </s> 
{142}<s> <s> elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , by talking in this way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you promised me to insist upon her marrying him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she talked to elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though her manner varied , however , her determination never did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper ,  - i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they entered the breakfast room<s> <s> charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast - room , where mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of her family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pray do , my dear miss{144} lucas , she added , in a melancholy tone;  - for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me; i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ay , there she comes , continued mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet ,  - looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have done with you from this very day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not that i have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nobody can tell what i suffer! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it is always so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those who do not complain are never pitied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls ,<s> <s>  - now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins and me have a little conversation together . </s> </s> 
{145}<s> <s> elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could; and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a doleful voice mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet thus began the projected conversation: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear madam , replied he ,  - let us be for ever silent on this point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> far be it from me , he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure ,  - to resent the behaviour of your daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been , in early preferment; and , i trust , i am resigned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i have often observed , that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will not , i hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour , without having paid yourself and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my conduct may , i fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own; but we are all liable to error . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have certainly meant well through the whole affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologize . </s> </s> 
{146}<s> <s> he discussion of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or{147} by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the morrow produced no abatement of mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins was also in the same state of angry pride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton , to inquire if mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he joined them on their entering the town , and attended them to their aunt s , where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy;that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendations which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk he particularly attended to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the compliment it offered to herself;{148} and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - walked back with them<s> <s> soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot - pressed paper , well covered with a lady s fair , flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you shall hear what she says . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst had a house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next was in these words: - i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society , my dearest friend; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i depend on you for that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  to these high - flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley s being there; and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but may we not hope that the period of future happiness , to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will read it to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter: i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the crowd , but of that i despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - it is evident by this , added jane ,  - that he comes back no more this winter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it must be his own doing; he is his own master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but you do not know all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will have no reserves from you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister s partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?   what think you of this sentence , my dear lizzy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it not clear enough? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means ( most kindly!  ) to put me on my guard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can there be any other opinion on the subject? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , there can; for mine is totally different . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you shall have it in a few words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane shook her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection; miss bingley , i am sure , cannot: she is not such a simpleton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that , because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if we thought alike of miss bingley , replied jane ,  - your representation of all this might make me quite easy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i know the foundation is unjust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived , by all means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must decide for yourself , said elizabeth;  - and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you , by all means , to refuse him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how can you talk so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said jane , faintly smiling;  - you must know , that , though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate . </s> </s> 
{153}<s> <s>  - i did not think you would; and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she represented to her sister , as forcibly as possible , what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield , and answer every wish of her heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they agreed that mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together . </s> </s> 
{154}<s> <s> he bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases; and again , during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it keeps him in good humour , said she ,  - and i am more obliged to you than i can express . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was very amiable; but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of:its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s addresses , by engaging them towards herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such was miss lucas s scheme; and appearances were so favourable , that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character; for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with{155} admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his reception , however , was of the most flattering kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in as short a time as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady lucas began directly to calculate , with more interest than the matter had ever{156}<s> <s>  - so much love and eloquence<s> <s> excited before , how many years longer mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> james s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but still he would be her husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable provision for well - educated young women of small fortune , and , however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty - seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she resolved to give her the information herself; and therefore charged mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear madam , he replied ,  - this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said ,<s> <s>  - but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here , my good sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear sir , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins ,  - i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you cannot be too much on your guard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and , depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth . </s> </s> 
{159}<s> <s> with proper civilities , the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that , if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers , he might become a very agreeable companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two: but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out ,<s> <s>  - engaged to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear charlotte , impossible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied ,<s> <s>  - why should you be surprised , my dear eliza? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you? {160}<s> <s> but elizabeth had now recollected herself; and , making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her , with tolerable firmness , that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not romantic , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ask only a comfortable home; and , considering mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth quietly answered  - undoubtedly; and , after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charlotte did not stay much longer; and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the strangeness of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible that , when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charlotte , the wife of mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself , and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen . </s> </s> 
{161}<s> <s> lizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family . </s> </s>

<s> <s> nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment: but sir william s good - breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> collins had been taken in; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together; and , fourthly , that the match might be broken off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two inferences , however ,{163} were plainly deduced from the whole: one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing could console and nothing appease her . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton . </s> </s>

<s> <s> between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could{164} ever subsist between them again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bennet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of mr . </s> </s>

{169}<s> <s> elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . </s> </s>

<s> <s> that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution , which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best; but her sister s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself . </s> </s>

<s> <s> remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe , for everybody s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you alluded to something else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot misunderstand you , but i entreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that person{172} to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - and men take care that they should . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified; but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am far from attributing any part of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; to the last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stop me , whilst you can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i cannot believe it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your first position is false . </s> </s>

<s> <s> her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley must be down again in the summer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet treated the matter differently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , lizzy , said he , one day ,  - your sister is crossed in love , i find . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i congratulate her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when is your turn to come? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now is your time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let wickham be your man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we must not all expect jane s good fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family . </s> </s> 
{175}<s> <s> fter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the following monday , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came , as usual , to spend the christmas at longbourn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well - bred and agreeable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> philips , was an amiable , intelligent ,{176} elegant woman , and a great favourite with her longbourn nieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first part of mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner s business , on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when this was done , she had a less active part to play . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley if she could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , lizzy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , sister! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane , said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sorry it went off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but these things happen so often! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a young man , such as you describe mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and , when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we do not suffer by accident . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{178} it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but that expression of violently in love  is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray , how violent was mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> could there be finer symptoms? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is not general incivility the very essence of love? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor jane! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . </s> </s> 
{179}<s> <s>  - and that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear aunt , how could you think of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy may , perhaps , have heard of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it; and , depend upon it , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley never stirs without him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so much the better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope they will not meet at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but does not jane correspond with his sister? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she will drop the acquaintance entirely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re - animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped , by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the engagement was for home ,{180} some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common; and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy by character perfectly well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , consequently , was an inexhaustible subject of discourse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on being made acquainted with the present mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill - natured boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seriously , i would have you be on your guard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him , in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have nothing to say against him: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as it isyou must not let your fancy run away with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , i am sure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must not disappoint your father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , you need not be under any alarm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will take care of myself , and of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - elizabeth , you are not serious now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i see the imprudence of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , that abominable mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father , however , is partial to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , i will do my best . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as i did the other day , said elizabeth , with a con{183}scious smile;  - very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do not imagine that he is always here so often . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now i hope you are satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth , having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted ,a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane; but , as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> thursday was to be the wedding - day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - and i have another favour to ask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you come and see me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not likely to leave kent for some time . </s> </s>

<s> <s> indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth soon heard from her friend , and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it should be equally unreserved was impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane had already written a few lines to her sister , to announce their safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys . </s> </s>

<s> <s> jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i did not think caroline in spirits , were her words ,  - but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was right , therefore; my last letter had never reached her . </s> </s>

<s> <s> after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay , and , yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the meantime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i pity , though i cannot help blaming , her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking ,{187} as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot understand it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me hear from you very soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray go to see them , with sir william and maria . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned , as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s sister , as , by wickham s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information; and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was{188} watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but elizabeth , less clear - sighted perhaps in this case than in charlotte s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this was acknowledged to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner; and , after relating the circumstances , she thus went on: - i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but my feelings are not only cordial towards him , they are even impartial towards miss king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there can be no love in all this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my watchfulness has been effectual; and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> march was to take elizabeth to hunsford . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan ,{190} and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the journey would , moreover , give her a peep at jane; and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became as perfect as plan could be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest , which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced , that , whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing . </s> </s> 
{191}<s> <s> her fellow - travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good - humoured girl , but as empty - headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william s too long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a journey of only twenty - four miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner s door , jane was at a drawing - room window watching their arrival: when they entered the passage , she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing - room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was reasonable , however , to hope that they would not continue long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself ,{192} which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , my dear elizabeth , she added ,  - what sort of girl is miss king? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where does discretion end , and avarice begin? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know no harm of her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nowhy should he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if she does not object to it , why should we? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - her not objecting does not justify him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it only shows her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling . </s> </s> 
{193}<s> <s>  - well , cried elizabeth ,  - have it as you choose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , lizzy , that is what i do not choose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sick of them all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thank heaven! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am going to - morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take care , lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner;  - but perhaps , to the lakes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what felicity! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you give me fresh life and vigour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . </s> </s> 
{194}<s> <s> very object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length the parsonage was discernible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the garden{195} sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , everything declared they were arriving . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage: his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect , and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but though everything seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend , that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not seldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general charlotte{196} wisely did not hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey , and of all that had happened in london , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but of all the views which his garden , or which the country or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from his garden , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies , not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband s help . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was rather small , but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency , of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort{197} throughout , and by charlotte s evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins joining in , observed ,<s> <s>  - yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should say , one of her ladyship s carriages , for she has several . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman , indeed , added charlotte ,  - and a most attentive neighbour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed , elizabeth , in the solitude of her chamber , had to meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with , her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenour of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of{198} mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and , after listening a moment , she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make haste , and come down this moment . </s> </s> 
{199}<s> <s> elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more; and down they ran into the dining - room which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies , stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and is this all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - la! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear , said maria , quite shocked at the mistake ,  - it is not lady catherine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jenkinson , who lives with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other is miss de bourgh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only look at her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who would have thought she could be so thin and small! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why does she not come in? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i like her appearance , said elizabeth , struck with other ideas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , she will do for him very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and sir william , to elizabeth s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day . </s> </s> 
{200}<s> <s> r . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s triumph , in consequence of this invitation , was complete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i confess , said he ,  - that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to{201} drink tea and spend the evening at rosings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am the less surprised at what has happened , replied sir william ,  - from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth ,<s> <s>  - do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasion for anything more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> james s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria s alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth s courage did not fail her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the entrance hall , of which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jenkinson were sitting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them; and as mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in spite of having been at st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly - marked features , which might once have been handsome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was not rendered formidable by silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self - importance , and brought mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view , mr . </s> </s> 
{204}<s> <s> the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son - in - law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the party did not supply much conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the ladies returned to the drawing - room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she inquired into charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so{205} small a family as hers , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the intervals of her discourse with mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who , she observed to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine then observed ,<s> <s>  - your father s estate is entailed on mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for your sake , turning to charlotte ,  - i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you play and sing , miss bennet? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to  you shall try it some day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do your sisters play and sing? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - not one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my mother would have no objection , but my father hates london . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - has your governess left you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we never had any governess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no governess! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> five daughters brought up at home without a governess! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never heard of such a thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then who taught you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who attended to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without a governess , you must have been neglected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those who chose to be idle certainly might . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ay , no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am always glad to get a young person well placed out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine ,  said she , you have given me a treasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  are any of your younger sisters out , miss bennet? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what , all five out at once? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> very odd! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and you only the second . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the younger ones out before the elder are married! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , my youngest is not sixteen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps she is full young to be much in company . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but really , ma am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with three younger sisters grown up , replied elizabeth , smiling ,  - your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure ,therefore you need not conceal your age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not one - and - twenty . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> sir william did not say much . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes  conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> very few days passed in which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty . </s> </s>

<s> <s> their other engagements were few , as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses  reach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , however , was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away . </s> </s>

<s> <s> darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine , who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his arrival was soon known at the parsonage; for mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> charlotte had seen them from her husband s room , crossing the road , and{214} immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding ,<s> <s>  - i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door - bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she answered him in the usual way; and , after a moment s pause , added ,<s> <s>  - my eldest sister has been in town these three months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you never happened to see her there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet . </s> </s>

<s> <s> colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s pretty friend had , moreover , caught his fancy very much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out ,<s> <s>  - what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me hear what it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we were talking of music , madam , said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , said lady catherine;  - and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . </s> </s>

<s> <s> my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall not say that you are mistaken , he replied ,  - because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which , in fact , are not your own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam ,  - your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand , give me leave to say , very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not afraid of you , said he , smilingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , cried colonel fitzwilliam . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should like to know how he behaves among strangers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you shall hear , thenbut prepare for something very{219} dreadful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a balland at this ball , what do you think he did? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he danced only four dances! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sorry to pain you , but so it was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my fingers wait your orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps , said darcy ,  - i should have judged better had i sought an introduction , but i am ill - qualified to recommend myself to strangers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill - qualified to recommend himself to strangers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i can answer your question , said fitzwilliam ,  - without applying to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is because he will not give himself the trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , said darcy ,  - of conversing easily with those i have never seen before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my fingers , said elizabeth ,  - do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy smiled and said ,  - you are perfectly right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we neither of us perform to strangers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth immediately began playing again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy ,<s> <s>  - miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste . </s> </s> 
{221}<s> <s> lizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they then sat down , and when her inquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something; and in this emergency recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed ,<s> <s>  - how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley to see you all after him so soon; for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perfectly so , i thank you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she found that she was to receive no other answer; and , after a short pause , added ,<s> <s>  - i think i have understood that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley did not take the{223} house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should not be surprised , said darcy ,  - if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins first came to hunsford . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my friend has an excellent understandingthough i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins as the wisest thing she ever did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she seems perfectly happy , however; and , in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an easy distance do you call it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is nearly fifty miles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> little more than half a day s journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , i call it a very easy distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should never have considered the distance as one of{224} the advantages of the match , cried elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins was settled near her family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said ,  - you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you cannot have been always at longbourn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice ,<s> <s>  - are you pleased with kent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tte -  - tte surprised them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - accompanied by their aunt<s> <s> {226}<s> <s>  - what can be the meaning of this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said charlotte , as soon as he was gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte s wishes , to be the case; and , after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do , which was the more probable from the time of year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all field sports were over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration , of her former favourite , george wickham; and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he{227} seldom appeared really animated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins knew not what to make of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was , beyond comparison , the pleasantest man: he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how it could occur a second time , therefore , was very odd! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet it did , and even the third . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s happiness; and that in speaking of rosings , and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was engaged one day , as she walked , in re - perusing jane s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , she saw , on looking up , that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> putting away the letter immediately , and forcing a smile , she said ,<s> <s>  - i did not know before that you ever walked this way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have been making the tour of the park , he replied ,  - as i generally do every year , and intended to close it with a call at the parsonage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you going much farther? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i am at his disposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but so we all do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> younger sons cannot marry where they like . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she coloured at the idea; but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone ,  - and pray , what is the usual price of an earl s younger son? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present; and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said colonel fitzwilliam ,  - that is an advantage which he must divide with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you , indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and pray what sort of a guardian do you make? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> does your charge give you much trouble? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she directly replied ,<s> <s>  - you need not be frightened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never heard any harm of her; and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst and miss bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i think i have heard you say that you know them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their brother is a pleasant , gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of darcy s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh yes , said elizabeth drily - mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy is uncommonly kind to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - care of him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{232} from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was all conjecture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a circumstance which darcy of course could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may depend upon my not mentioning it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars; and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy give you his reasons for this interference? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what arts did he use to separate them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he did not talk to me of his own arts , said fitzwilliam , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he only told me what i have now told you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why was he to be the judge? {233}<s> <s>  - you are rather disposed to call his interference officious? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination; or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , she continued , recollecting herself ,  - as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is not an unnatural surmise , said fitzwilliam;  - but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer; and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy could have such boundless influence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the causehis pride and caprice were the causeof all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted . </s> </s> 
{234}<s> <s>  - there were some very strong objections against the lady , were colonel fitzwilliam s words; and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she thought of her mother , indeed , her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided , at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley for his sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences ,{236} or any communication of present suffering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and , agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy walk into the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked{237} about the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a silence of several minutes , he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in vain have i struggled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it will not do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my feelings will not be repressed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his sense of her inferiority , of its being a degradation , of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such a circumstance{238} could only exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said ,<s> <s>  - in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i cannoti have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said ,<s> <s>  - and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it is of small importance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i might as well inquire , replied she ,  - why , with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i have other provocations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know i have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{239} had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she pronounced these words , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with assumed tranquillity he then replied ,  - i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> towards him i have been kinder than towards myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but it is not merely this affair , she continued ,  - on which my dislike is founded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this subject , what can you have to say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns , said darcy , in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated darcy , contemptuously , - yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and of your infliction , cried elizabeth , with energy;  - you have reduced him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have done all this! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and this , cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room ,  - is your opinion of me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is the estimation in which you hold me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thank you for explaining it so fully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , perhaps , added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her ,  - these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were natural and just . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said ,<s> <s>  - you are mistaken , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she went on ,<s> <s>  - from the very beginning , from the first moment , i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that he should have been in love with her for so many months! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner which he had mentioned mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation , and hurried her away to her room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything else; and , totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , she was directly retreating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had by that time reached it also; and , holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said , with a look of haughty composure ,  - i have been walking in the grove some time , in the hope of meeting you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you do me the honour of reading that letter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the envelope itself was likewise full . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written{245} and read . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley from your sister ,and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , i can only say that i am sorry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the necessity must be obeyed , and further apology would be absurd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at that ball , while i had{246} the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas s accidental information , that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if it be so , if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain; but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it; i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will only say , farther , that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he left netherfield for london on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the part which i acted is now to be explained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his sisters  uneasiness had been equally excited with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not{248} suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance , which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister s indifference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot blame myself for having done thus much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that they might have met without ill consequence is , perhaps , probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is done , however , and it was done for the best . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant; but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the vicious propensities , the want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy could not have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but whatever may be the sentiments which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it adds even another motive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was also a legacy of one{250} thousand pounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i rather wished than believed him to be sincere; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i knew that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the business was therefore soon settled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in town , i believe , he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for about three years i heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will hardly blame me{251} for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how he lived , i know not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate; and thither also went mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham , undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement; and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you may imagine what{252} i felt and how i acted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but i wrote to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his revenge would have been complete indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood , he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at , ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the truth of everything here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who , from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will only add , god bless you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded , that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a strong prejudice{254} against everything he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent , but haughty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was all pride and insolence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickhamwhen she read , with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfher feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming ,  - this must be false! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this cannot be! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will , the difference was great . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again she read on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told{256}<s> <s>  - meeting accidentally in town<s> <s> himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of inquiring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy; or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class what mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but no such recollection befriended her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcythat mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she remembered , also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal , it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darc{258}y s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in further justification of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , she could not but allow that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;that , proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintancean acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued;that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of neither{259} darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how despicably have i acted! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i , who have prided myself on my discernment! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i , who have valued myself on my abilities! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how humiliating is this discovery! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet , how just a humiliation! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but vanity , not love , has been my folly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> till this moment , i never knew myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from herself to jane , from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s explanation there had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment; and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she felt that jane s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self - attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that jane s disappointment had , in fact , been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence; mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could think only of her letter . </s> </s> 
{262}<s> <s> elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that , had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship s indignation would have been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their first subject was the diminution of the rosings  party . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , said lady catherine;  - i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were excessively sorry to go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy seemed to feel it most acutelymore , i think , than last year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his attachment to rosings certainly increases . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added ,<s> <s>  - but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you are all kindness , madam; but i believe we must abide by our original plan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men - servants go with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must send john with the young ladies , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my uncle is to send a servant for us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he keeps a man - servant , does he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> reflection must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect: but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in the unhappy defects of her family , a subject of yet heavier chagrin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> catherine , weak - spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice; and lydia , self - willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{266} while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when to these recollections was added the development of wickham s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know not , miss elizabeth , said he ,  - whether mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attention she had received , must make her feel the obliged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied ,<s> <s>  - it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see how continually we are engaged there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in truth , i must acknowledge , that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i flatter myself , at least , that you will be able to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be as well to be silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we seem to have been designed for each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add , that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor charlotte! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins; and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then handed{270} her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they had forgotten to leave any message<s> <s>  - but , he added ,  - you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . </s> </s> 
{271}<s> <s>  - good gracious! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet how many things have happened! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a great many indeed , said her companion , with a sigh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how much i shall have to tell! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner s house , where they were to remain a few days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not without an effort , meanwhile , that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern ,  - oh , but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when i have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are they , indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mamma would like to go , too , of all things! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only think what a miserable summer else we shall have! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , thought elizabeth;  - that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good heaven! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia laughed , and said ,<s> <s>  - ay , that is just like your formality and discretion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am glad he is gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never saw such a long chin in my life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and mary king is safe! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> added elizabeth;  - safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side , said jane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sure there is not on his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who could about such a nasty little freckled thing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered; and , after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and lydia s purchases , were seated in it . </s> </s> 
{275}<s> <s>  - how nicely we are crammed in! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried lydia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am glad i brought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another band - box! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you seen any pleasant men? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you had any flirting? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is almost three - and - twenty! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can t think . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she says lizzy had better have taken mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lord! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how i should like to be married before any of you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dear me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster s! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; ( by - the - bye , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forster and me are such friends!  ) and so she asked the two harringtons to come: but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself; and then , what do you think we did? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady ,only think what fun! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not a soul knew of it , but colonel and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lord! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how i laughed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought i should have died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and that made the men{276} suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia , assisted by kitty s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their reception at home was most kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their party in the dining - room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects which occupied them: lady lucas was inquiring of maria , across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , mary , said she ,  - i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you{277} too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then when we came away it was such fun! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought we never should have got into the coach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was ready to die of laughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then we were so merry all the way home! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we talked and laughed so loud , that anybody might have heard us ten miles off! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i confess they would have no charms for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should infinitely prefer a book . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but of this answer lydia heard not a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton , and see how everybody went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was another reason , too , for her opposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the comfort to her , of the regiment s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents . </s> </s> 
{278}<s> <s> lizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy and herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was sorry that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you do not blame me , however , for refusing him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you will know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a stroke was this for poor jane , who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor was darcy s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this will not do , said elizabeth;  - you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s , but you shall do as you choose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and having to relate such a thing of his sister! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is really too distressing , i am sure you must feel it so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor wickham! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never thought mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , i could not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and with no one to speak to of what i felt , no jane to comfort me , and say that i had not been so very weak , and{281} vain , and nonsensical , as i knew i had! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , how i wanted you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bennet paused a little , and then replied ,  - surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is your own opinion? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that it ought not to be attempted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the general prejudice against mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not equal to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham will soon be gone; and , therefore , it will not signify to anybody here what he really is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some time hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at present i will say nothing about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are quite right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we must not make him desperate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this{282} conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbade the disclosure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she dared not relate the other half of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then , said she ,  - if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , lizzy , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , one day ,  - what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i told my sister philips so the other day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in{283} london . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am determined never to speak of it again<s> <s> {284}<s> <s>  - i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is just as he chooses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , lizzy , continued her mother , soon afterwards ,  - and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , well , i only hope it will last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what sort of table do they keep? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , nothing at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a great deal of good management , depend upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they will never be distressed for money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , much good may it do them! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was a subject which they could not mention before me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; it would have been strange if they had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . </s> </s> 
{285}<s> <s> he first week of their return was soon gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the second began . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dejection was almost universal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia ,{286} whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard - heartedness in any of the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good heaven! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are we to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how can you be smiling so , lizzy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five - and - twenty years ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sure , said she ,  - i cried for two days together when colonel miller s regiment went away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought i should have broke my heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sure i shall break mine , said lydia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> observed mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh yes! if one could but go to brighton! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but papa is so disagreeable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she felt anew the justice of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a resemblance in good - humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their three months  acquaintance they had been intimate two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forster , the delight of mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy , calling for everyone s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death - warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her , were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - already arisen! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has she frightened away some of your lovers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor little lizzy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do not be cast down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , you are mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> excuse me ,for i must speak plainly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this danger kitty is also comprehended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she will follow wherever lydia leads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace? {289}<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and , affectionately taking her hand , said , in reply ,<s> <s>  - do not make yourself uneasy , my love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the officers will find women better worth their notice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations by dwelling on them . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - tenderly flirting<s> <s> had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed;{291} and their raptures continued , with little intermission , to the very day of lydia s leaving home . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure; for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified , and her preference secured , at any time , by their renewal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton , he dined , with others of the officers , at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good - humour , that , on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , almost every day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy improves on acquaintance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried wickham , with a look which did not escape her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and pray may i ask but checking himself , he added , in a gayer tone ,  - is it in address that he improves? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents ,<s> <s>  - you , who so well know my feelings towards mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the{293} appearance of what is right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his fear of her has always operated , i know , when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible ,advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and , in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard . </s> </s> 
{294}<s> <s> ad elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{295} respect , esteem , and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill - judged a direction of talentstalents which , rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and{296} sister , whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering - place and a camp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not , in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but it is fortunate , thought she ,  - that i have something to wish for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when lydia went away she promised to write very{297} often and very minutely to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forster called her , and they were going to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt , for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public . </s> </s>

<s> <s> elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough . </s> </s>

<s> <s> with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected . </s> </s>

<s> <s> gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn . </s> </s>

<s> <s> in talking over their route the evening before , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said her aunt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a place , too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she felt that she had no{300} business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner abused her stupidity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , said she ,  - i should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have some of the finest woods in the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the possibility of meeting mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would be dreadful! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private inquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and , with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a most welcome negative followed the last question; and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a large , handsome stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was delighted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a large , well - proportioned room , handsomely fitted up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions; but{303} from every window there were beauties to be seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , no , recollecting herself ,  - that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; i should not have been allowed to invite them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> reynolds replied , that he was; adding ,  - but we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her aunt now called her to look at a picture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is now gone into the army , she added;  - but i am afraid he has turned out very wild . </s> </s> 
{304}<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures ,  - is my masterand very like him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was drawn at the same time as the otherabout eight years ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have heard much of your master s fine person , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , looking at the picture;  - it is a handsome face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - does that young lady know mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth coloured , and said ,  - a little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sure i know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this room was my late master s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she plays and sings all day long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master: she comes here to - morrow with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not so much as i could wish , sir: but i dare say he may spend half his time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - except , thought elizabeth ,  - when she goes to ramsgate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if your master would marry , you might see more of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not know who is good enough for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth could not help saying ,  - it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i say no more than the truth , and what everybody will say that knows him , replied the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added ,  - i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was praise of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are lucky in having such a master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , i know i am . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i have always{306} observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous - hearted boy in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth almost stared at her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can this be mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thought she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his father was an excellent man , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , ma am , that he was indeed; and his son will be just like himjust as affable to the poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> reynolds could interest her on no other point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she related the subjects of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture in vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is the best landlord , and the best master , said she ,  - that ever lived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in what an amiable light does this place him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thought elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this fine account of him , whispered her aunt as they walked ,  - is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps we might be deceived . </s> </s> 
{307}<s> <s> on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shown into a very pretty sitting - room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is certainly a good brother , said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight , when she should enter the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and this is always the way with him , she added . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is nothing he would not do for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed - rooms , were all that remained to be shown . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she stood several minutes before the picture , in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the commendation bestowed on him by mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> reynolds was of no trifling nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs; and , taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth ,{309} if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure; but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was overpowered by shame and vexation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how strange must it{310} appear to him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why did she come? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and his behaviour , so strikingly altered ,what could it mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that he should even speak to her was amazing! but to speak with such civility , to inquire after her family! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park , when he put his letter into her hand! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy then was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of everything , she was still dear to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been{311} that in his voice , which was not like ease . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they entered the woods , and , bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds; whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , and one of its narrowest parts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice - wood which bordered it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction; but their progress was{312} slow , for mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy approaching them , and at no great distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and , to imitate his politeness , she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words  - delightful , and  - charming , when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing , he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the introduction , however , was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her astonishment , however , was extreme; and continually was she repeating ,  - why is he so altered? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from what can it proceed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is impossible that he should still love me . </s> </s> 
{314}<s> <s> after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water - plant , there chanced to be a little alteration . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - there is also one other person in the party , he continued after a pause ,  - who more particularly wishes to be known to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton? {315}<s> <s> the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they soon outstripped the others; and when they had reached the carriage , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dovedale with great perseverance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is something a little stately in him , to be sure , replied her aunt;  - but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , replied her uncle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from what we have seen of him , continued mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner ,  - i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , to be sure , the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and that , in the eye of a servant , comprehends every virtue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham; and , therefore , gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham s so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of anything else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years  discontinuance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s civility , and , above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister . </s> </s> 
{318}<s> <s> lizabeth had settled it that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was , consequently , resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , immediately recognizing the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her{319} uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while these newly - born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was less handsome than her brother , but{320} there was sense and good - humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he inquired in a friendly , though general , way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good - humoured ease that he had ever done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had long wished to see him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suspicions which had just arisen of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to{321} whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre - possessed in her favour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that , as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour{322} to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival to jane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it  - was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her; and , before she could reply , he added ,  - it is above eight months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw{323} him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self - consequence or unbending reserve , as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose to depart , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , construing all this into a wish{324} of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased; and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eager to be alone , and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she had no reason to fear mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well - known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy afterwards discharged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she certainly did not hate him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good - will which could not be overlooked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love , ardent love , it must be attributed; and , as such , its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were , therefore , to go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner left them soon after breakfast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on reaching the house , they were shown through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> its windows , opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> annesley , a genteel , agreeable - looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well - bred than either of the others; and between her and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{329} this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley s voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk , they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river; and had left him only on learning{330} that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley saw all this likewise; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility ,<s> <s>  - pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they must be a great loss to your family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name: but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress; but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill - natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{331} had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had certainly formed such a plan; and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabet{332}h s person , behaviour , and dress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but georgiana would not join her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , she cried:  - i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned ,no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for my own part , she rejoined ,  - i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all{333} the success she expected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should as soon call her mother a wit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of everything but himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner thought of him , and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the one mis - sent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was to this effect: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all{335} well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what i have to say relates to poor lydia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth , with wickham! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am very , very sorry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so imprudent a match on both sides! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our poor mother is sadly grieved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the express was sent off directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth , on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter; i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> imprudent as a marriage between mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though lydia s short letter to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> f . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from b . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , intending to trace their route . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney - coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know not what to think . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after making every possible inquiry on that side of london , colonel f . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success ,no such people had been seen to pass through . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> f . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>; but no one can throw any blame on them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydi{337}a s connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to everything? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i grieve to find , however , that colonel f . </s> </s>

<s> <s> was not a man to be trusted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> could she exert herself , it would be better , but this is not to be expected; and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence , one cannot wonder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now , as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> adieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not; but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what he means to do , i am sure i know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to - morrow evening . </s> </s>

<s> <s> where , where is my uncle? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s situation , hastily exclaimed ,  - i beg your pardon , but i must leave you . </s> </s>

<s> <s> on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration ,  - let me call your maid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a glass of wine; shall i get you one? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are very ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i thank you , she replied , endeavouring to recover herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is nothing the matter with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am quite well , i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you know him too well to doubt the rest . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but it is all , all too late now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to scotland . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my father has gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how are they even to be discovered? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when my eyes were opened to his real character , oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i knew noti was afraid of doing too much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy made no answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{341} elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might , perhaps , authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be that as it may , she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never since reading jane s second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now it was all too natural . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody . </s> </s>

<s> <s> gardiner could not but be deeply affected . </s> </s>

<s> <s> had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , meanwhile , having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn . </s> </s>

<s> <s> cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot think so very ill of wickham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can you , yourself , lizzie , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if , indeed , it should be so! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i dare not hope it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the first place , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner ,  - there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then ,supposing them to be in londonthey may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but why all this secrecy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why any fear of detection? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham will never marry a woman without some money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cannot afford it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake{347} forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge; for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine , from my father s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , really , i know not what to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she is very young: she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since the shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she has been doing everything in her power , by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greaterwhat shall i call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of whom does jane ever think ill? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do , indeed , replied elizabeth , colouring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy; and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and there are other circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes! that , that is the worst of all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam , i was {349}ignorant of the truth myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months: but he never distinguished her by any particular attention; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fixed there by the keenest of all anguish ,{350} self - reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope everything will be well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is my father in town? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , he went on tuesday , as i wrote you word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and have you heard from him often? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and my motherhow is she? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how are you all? {351}<s> <s>  - my mother is tolerably well , i trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are quite well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but youhow are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you look pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how much you must have gone through! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they were all in the drawing - room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i had been able , said she ,  - to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family , this would not{352} have happened: but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but i was over - ruled , as i always am . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor , dear child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now here s mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not give way to useless alarm , added he:  - though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a few days more , we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my dear brother , replied mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet ,  - that is exactly what i could most wish for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be; and if they are not married already , make them marry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet from fighting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , brother , how kind you are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended in the absence of her daughters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth , with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table ,<s> <s>  - this is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give me further particulars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what did colonel forster say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had they no{355} apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they must have seen them together for ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia s side , but nothing to give him any alarm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am so grieved for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had colonel forster seen denny himself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying , and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i felt a little uneasya little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other many weeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but not before they went to brighton? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i believe not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these were the contents: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them , and sign my name lydia wickham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a good joke it will be! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can hardly write for laughing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good - bye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give my love to colonel forster . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope you will drink to our good journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your affectionate friend ,  - lydia bennet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my poor father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how he must have felt it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never saw anyone so shocked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not speak a word for full ten minutes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know: i hope there was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my mother was in hysterics; and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your attendance upon her has been too much for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh that i had been with you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it{358} right for either of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till thursday with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind: she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she had better have stayed at home , cried elizabeth:  - perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one s neighbours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> assistance is impossible; condolence , insufferable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he meant , i believe , replied jane ,  - to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if anything could be made out from them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . </s> </s> 
{359}<s> <s> he whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his family knew him to be , on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he was gone , they were certain at least of{360} receiving constant information of what was going on; and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she shared in their attendance on mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman s family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin still more certain; and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when , if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them . </s> </s> 
{361}<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london , and promised to write again very soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was also a postscript to this effect: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if there were anyone that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at present we have nothing to guide us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but before they heard again from mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins; which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read; and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was as follows: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be assured , my dear sir , that mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be , of all others , most afflicting to a parent s mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{363} the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your<s> <s>  - to whom i have related the affair<s> <s> daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied;{364} in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me advise you , then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am , dear sir , etc . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , etc . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations; for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he owed a good deal{365} in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family; jane heard them with horror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a gamester! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner added , in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother - in - law s entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half - expectation which mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the present unhappy state of the family rendered any{366} other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that ,though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia s infamy somewhat better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied ,  - say nothing of that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who should suffer but myself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must not be too severe upon yourself , replied elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may well warn me against such an evil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you suppose them to be in london? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and lydia used to want to go to london , added kitty . </s> </s> 
{367}<s> <s> then , after a short silence , he continued ,  - lizzy , i bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shows some greatness of mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother s tea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is a parade , cried he ,  - which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not going to run away , papa , said kitty , fretfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne , for fifty pounds! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , kitty , i have at least learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well , said he ,  - do not make yourself unhappy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet ,  - i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean , hill? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have heard nothing from town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dear madam , cried mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> gardiner? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast - room; from thence to the library;their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said ,<s> <s>  - if you are looking for my master , ma am , he is walking towards the little copse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out ,<s> <s>  - oh , papa , what news? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what news? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i have had a letter from him by express . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , and what news does it bringgood or bad? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he , taking the letter from his pocket;  - but perhaps you would like to read it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane now came up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - read it aloud , said their father ,  - for i hardly know myself what it is about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear brother ,<s> <s>  - at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give{370} you satisfaction . </s> </s>

<s> <s> they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these are conditions which , considering everything , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - edw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> {372}<s> <s>  - is it possible? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried elizabeth , when she had finished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him , said her sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear father , i congratulate you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; but it must be done soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear father , she cried ,  - come back and write immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> consider how important every moment is in such a case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i dislike it very much , he replied;  - but it must be done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - andmay i ask? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - complied with! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am only ashamed of his asking so little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and they must marry! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet he is such a man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , they must marry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is nothing else to be done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but there are two things that i want very much to know:one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other , how i am ever to pay him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - money! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my uncle! </s> </s> 
{373}<s> <s>  - that is very true , said elizabeth;  - though it had not occurred to me before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a small sum could not do all this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said her father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds: i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ten thousand pounds! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> heaven forbid! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet made no answer; and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and they are really to be married! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and for this we are to be thankful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i comfort myself with thinking , replied jane ,  - that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has children of his own , and may have more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how could he spare half ten thousand pounds? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their taking her home , and affording{374} her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by this time she is actually with them! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , said jane:  - i hope and trust they will yet be happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is useless to talk of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied ,<s> <s>  - just as you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may we take my uncle s letter to read to her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth took the letter from his writing - table , and they went upstairs together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mary and kitty were both with mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet: one communication would , therefore , do for all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet could hardly contain herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she{375} was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she will be married! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall see her again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my good , kind brother! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and to see dear wickham too! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the clothes , the wedding clothes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stay , stay , i will go myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ring the bell , kitty , for hill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will put on my things in a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear , dear lydia! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner s behaviour laid them all under . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for we must attribute this happy conclusion , she added ,  - in a great measure to his kindness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham with money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am so happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a short time , i shall have a daughter married . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how well it sounds! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she was only sixteen last june . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear jane , i{376} am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can t write; so i will dictate , and you write for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day s delay , she observed , would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will go to meryton , said she ,  - as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kitty , run down and order the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hill began instantly to express her joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor lydia s situation must , at best , be bad enough; but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother - in - law; and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when first mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless; for , of course , they were to have a son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come; and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , for many years after lydia s birth , had been certain that he would . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet and the children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them; for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands , lydia s expenses had been very little within that sum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his letter was soon despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to be sure , it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world in some distant farm - house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{380} the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter; and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - haye park might do , said she ,  - if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing - room were larger; but ashworth is too far off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when they had withdrawn , he said to her ,  - mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was more alive to the{381} disgrace , which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was convinced{382} that she could have been happy with him , when it was no longer likely they should meet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner soon wrote again to his brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{383} the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham had resolved on quitting the militia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was greatly my wish that he should do so , he added ,  - as soon as his marriage was fixed on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham s intention to go into the regulars; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he promises fairly; and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has given in all his debts; i hope at least he has not deceived us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>yours , etc . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - e . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages {384}of wickham s removal from the shire , as clearly as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner could do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was not so well pleased with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment; and , besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody , and had so many favourites . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is so fond of mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his daughter s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled , that , as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme; and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it by dinnertime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennetsand jane more{386} especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the family were assembled in the breakfast - room to receive them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> smiles decked the face of mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia was lydia still; untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners were always so pleasing , that , had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth{387} had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down , resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she blushed , and jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no want of discourse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good - humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - only think of its being three months , she cried ,  - since i went away: it seems but a fortnight , i declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though i thought it would be very good fun if i was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he{388} might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth could bear it no longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she got up and ran out of the room; and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining - parlour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister ,<s> <s>  - ah , jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called  - mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham by each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hill and the two housemaids . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , mamma , said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast - room ,  - and what do you think of my husband? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is not he a charming man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sure my sisters must all envy me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i only hope they may have half my good luck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they must all go to brighton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very true; and if i had my will we should . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> must it be so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes; there is nothing in that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all . </s> </s> 
{389}<s> <s>  - i should like it beyond anything! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thank you for my share of the favour , said elizabeth;  - but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to lydia s for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his; and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia was exceedingly fond of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was her dear wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth ,<s> <s>  - lizzy , i never gave you an account of my wedding , i believe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are not you curious to hear how it was managed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i must tell you how it went off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you ll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not one party , or scheme , or anything! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to be sure , london was rather thin , but , however , the little theatre was open . </s> </s> 
{391}<s> <s>  - well , and so , just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , i recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy might have done as well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was to come there with wickham , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i quite forgot! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ought not to have said a word about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i promised them so faithfully! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what will wickham say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was to be such a secret! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you may depend upon my seeking no further . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , said lydia;  - for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be so angry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy had been at her sister s wedding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropped , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may readily comprehend , she added ,  - what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and , comparatively speaking , a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray write instantly , and let me understand itunless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of it:till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared{394} to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear niece ,<s> <s>  - i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must confess myself surprised by your application; i did not expect it from you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your uncle is as much surprised as i am; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was all over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them bothwickham repeatedly , lydia once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his character was to speak for itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he had another motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a lady , it seems , a mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were in  street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance as far as it would go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{396} she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt had never been his design . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham , of course , wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything being settled between them , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner could not be seen; and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the {397}departure of the former . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they met again on sunday , and then i saw him too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but our visitor was very obstinate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has been accused of many faults at different times; but this is the true one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain; and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , lizzy , this must go no further than yourself , or jane at most . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that wickham s character had been so{398} misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps there was some truth in this; though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i believe i have now told you everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was sometimes quite provoked; but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you be very angry with me , my dear{399} lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but slyness seems the fashion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the children have been wanting me this half hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yours , very sincerely ,  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and{400} finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her heart did whisper that he had done it for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brother - in - law of wickham! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every kind of pride must revolt from the connection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had , to be sure , done much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , everything to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him ,proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on{401} finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy and herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was roused from her seat and her reflections , by someone s approach; and , before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he , as he joined her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should be sorry , indeed , if it were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are the others coming out? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so , my dear sister , i find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she replied in the affirmative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , she did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what did she say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid hadnot turned out well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , he replied , biting his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we passed each other several times . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , said elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you see him while you were at lambton? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; he introduced us to his sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and do you like her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am very glad you liked her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope she will turn out well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you go by the village of kympton? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not recollect that we did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> excellent parsonage - house! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would have suited me in every respect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how should you have liked making sermons? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exceedingly well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one ought not to repine; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was not to be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have heard from authority , which i thought as good ,{403} that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did hear , too , that there was a time when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and it was not wholly without foundation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling , for her sister s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good - humoured smile ,<s> <s>  - come , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet . </s> </s> 
{405}<s> <s> the day of his and lydia s departure soon came; and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , lord! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not these two or three years , perhaps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my sisters may write to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is as fine a fellow , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , as soon as they were out of the house ,  - as ever i saw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am prodigiously proud of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the loss of her daughter made mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet very dull for several days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i often think , said she ,  - that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one seems so forlorn without them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , said elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was quite in the fidgets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head , by turns . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well , and so mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> philips first brought her the news ) . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , so much the better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not that i care about it , though . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure i never want to see him again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and who knows what may happen? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so , it is quite certain he is coming? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nichols was in meryton last night: i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he comes down on thursday , at the latest , very likely on wednesday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth; but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said ,<s> <s>  - i saw you look at me to - day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report; and i know i appeared{407} distressed; but don t imagine it was from any silly cause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth did not know what to make of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission , or being bold enough to come without it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will leave him to himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley comes , my dear , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet ,  - you will wait on him , of course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary{408} such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  tis an etiquette i despise , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if he wants our society , let him seek it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , however , that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we must have mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> long and the gouldings soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , in consequence of it , before they did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the day of his arrival drew near ,<s> <s>  - i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , said jane to her sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference; but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wish i could say anything to comfort you , replied elizabeth;  - but it is wholly out of my power . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley arrived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she counted the days that{409} must intervene before their invitation could be senthopeless of seeing him before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing - room window enter the paddock , and ride towards the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the windowshe lookedshe saw mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose; i am sure i do not know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - la! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good gracious! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy! and so it does , i vow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , any friend of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley s will always be welcome here , to be sure; but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each felt for the other , and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley s friend , without being heard by either of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardine{410}r s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me first see how he behaves , said she;  - it will then be early enough for expectation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the gentlemen s appearing , her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had ventured only one glance at darcy . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he was received by mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in derbyshire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please , than when they last met , were plainly expressed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - could i expect it to be otherwise? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yet why did he come? {412}<s> <s> she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a long time , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , since you went away , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss lucas is married and settled: and one of my own daughters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was in the times  and the courier ,  i know; though it was not put in as it ought to be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was only said , lately , george wickham , esq . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , to miss lydia bennet ,  without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , continued her mother;  - but at the same time , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , it is very hard to have her taken away from me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thank heaven! {413} he has some friends , though , perhaps , not so many as he deserves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few weeks , he believed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , said her mother ,  - i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s manor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the coveys for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary , such officious attention! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the first wish of my heart , said she to herself ,  - is never more to be in company with either of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me never see either one or the other again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little , but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found her as handsome as she had{414} been last year; as good - natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , she added;  - for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have not forgot , you see; and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year . </s> </s> 
{415}<s> <s> s soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or , in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects which must deaden them more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , said she ,  - did he come at all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he could be still amiable , still pleasing to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town; and why not to me? {416} if he fears me , why come hither? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he no longer cares for me , why silent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> teasing , teasing man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , very indifferent , indeed , said elizabeth , laughingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , jane! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good - humour and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour s visit , had revived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they repaired to the dining - room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on entering the room , he{417} seemed to hesitate; but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile: it was decided . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he placed himself by her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , with an expression of half - laughing alarm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was on one side of her mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind; and she would , at times , have given anything to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them{418} to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and on the gentlemen s approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper ,<s> <s>  - the men shan t come and part us , i am determined . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we want none of them; do we? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy had walked away to another part of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she followed him with her eyes , envied everyone to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee , and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a man who has once been refused! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee - cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying ,{419}<s> <s>  - is your sister at pemberley still? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; she will remain there till christmas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have all her friends left her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she now lost every expectation of pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was , unluckily , ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , girls , said she , as soon as they were left to themselves ,  - what say you to the day? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i think everything has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases  last week; and even mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy acknowledged that the partridges were{420} remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what do you think she said besides? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last!   she did , indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> long is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> long and her nieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> {421}<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it has been a very agreeable day , said miss bennet to elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope we may often meet again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lizzy , you must not do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it mortifies me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how hard it is in some cases to be believed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is a question which i hardly know how to answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley called again , and alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sat with them above an hour , and was{423} in remarkably good spirits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet invited him to dine with them; but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - next time you call , said she ,  - i hope we shall be more lucky . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , etc . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>; and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can you come to - morrow? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in ran mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet to her daughters  room , in her dressing - gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out ,<s> <s>  - my dear jane , make haste and hurry down . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he is , indeed . </s> </s>

<s> <s> never mind miss lizzy s hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we will be down as soon as we can , said jane;  - but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what has she to do with it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , be quick , be quick! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after tea , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went upstairs to her instrument . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without{424} making any impression on them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said ,  - what is the matter , mamma? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do you keep winking at me for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what am i to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing , child , nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty ,<s> <s>  - come here , my love , i want to speak to you , took her out of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her entreaty that she would not give in to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a few minutes , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet half opened the door and called out ,<s> <s>  - lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill - judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy returned within the stated time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative , and less eccentric , than the other had ever seen him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast - room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but on her returning to the drawing - room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not a syllable was uttered by either; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat{426} down , suddenly rose , and , whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure; and , instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  tis too much! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she added ,  - by far too much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not deserve it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must go instantly to my mother , she cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is gone to my father already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how shall i bear so much happiness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card - party , and was sitting upstairs with kitty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and this , said she ,  - is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the happiest , wisest , and most reasonable end! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose{427} conference with her father had been short and to the purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he hastily , as he opened the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with my mother upstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she will be down in a moment , i dare say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then shut the door , and , coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they shook hands with great cordiality; and then , till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness , and of jane s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super - excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour; and when mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said ,<s> <s>  - jane , i congratulate you . </s> </s> 
{428}<s> <s> jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have not a doubt of your doing very well together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy , that every servant will cheat you; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exceed their income! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then addressing her daughter ,  - oh , my dear , dear jane , i am so happy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sure i shan t get a wink of sleep all night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i knew how it would be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham , lydia , were all forgotten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at that moment she cared for no other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper; unless when some{429} barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has made me so happy , said she , one evening ,  - by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had not believed it possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but how did he account for it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it must have been his sisters  doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is the most unforgiving speech , said elizabeth ,  - that i ever heard you utter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good girl! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again? {430}<s> <s>  - he made a little mistake , to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried jane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i could but see you as happy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if there were but such another man for you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , no , let me shift for myself; and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins in time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world; though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune . </s> </s> 
{431}<s> <s> ne morning , about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining - room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the horses were post; and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was lady catherine de bourgh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were of course all intending to be surprised: but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth replied very concisely that she was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that , i suppose , is one of your sisters? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the ground , walking with a young man , who , i believe , will soon become a part of the family . </s> </s> 
{433}<s> <s>  - you have a very small park here , returned lady catherine , after a short silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this must be a most inconvenient sitting - room for the evening in summer: the windows are full west . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then added ,<s> <s>  - may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw them the night before last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment: but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating anything; and then , rising up , said to elizabeth ,<s> <s>  - miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go , my dear , cried her mother ,  - and show her ladyship about the different walks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i think she will be pleased with the hermitage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth obeyed; and , running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest downstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining - parlour and drawing - room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent - looking rooms , walked on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - after a short survey<s> <s> {435}<s> <s>  - how could i ever think her like her nephew? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she , as she looked in her face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , you are mistaken , madam; i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that youthat miss elizabeth bennet would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephewmy own nephew , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood , though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you believed it impossible to be true , said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain ,  - i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what could your ladyship propose by it? </s> </s> 
{436}<s> <s>  - your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , said elizabeth coolly ,  - will be rather a confirmation of itif , indeed , such a report is in existence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never heard that it was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is not to be borne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have not been accustomed to such language as this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me be rightly understood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , never . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy is engaged to my daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , what have you to say? {437}<s> <s>  - only this ,that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied ,<s> <s>  - the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from their infancy , they have been intended for each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while in their cradles we planned the union; and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friendsto his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; and i had heard it before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what is that to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> its completion depended on others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , miss bennet , interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . </s> </s> 
{438}<s> <s>  - these are heavy misfortunes , replied elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but the wife of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am ashamed of you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is nothing due to me on that score? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us sit down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line; and , on the father s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled , families . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their fortune on both sides is splendid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is this to be endured? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman s daughter; so far we are equal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are a gentleman s daughter . </s> </s> 
{439}<s> <s>  - whatever my connections may be , said elizabeth ,  - if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me , once for all , are you engaged to him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question , she could not but say , after a moment s deliberation ,<s> <s>  - i am not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine seemed pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - miss bennet , i am shocked and astonished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i expected to find a more reasonable young woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i certainly never shall give it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your ladyship wants mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished - for promise make their marriage at all more probable? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no further on the subject . </s> </s> 
{440}<s> <s>  - not so hasty , if you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know it all; that the young man s marrying her was a patched - up business , at the expense of your father and uncle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is her husband , who is the son of his late father s steward , to be his brother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> heaven and earth! of what are you thinking? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you can now have nothing further to say , she resentfully answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must beg to return to the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she rose as she spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine rose also , and they turned back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her ladyship was highly incensed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unfeeling , selfish girl! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know my sentiments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have said no such thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , replied elizabeth ,  - has any possible claim on me , in the present instance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no principle of either would be violated by my{441} marriage with mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment s concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and this is your real opinion! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall now know how to act . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage , when , turning hastily round , she added ,<s> <s>  - i take no leave of you , miss bennet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i send no compliments to your mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you deserve no such attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her mother impatiently met her at the door of her dressing - room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she did not choose it , said her daughter;  - she would go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is a very fine - looking woman! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and her calling here was prodigiously civil! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is on her road somewhere , i dare say; and so , passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible . </s> </s> 
{442}<s> <s> he discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a rational scheme , to be sure! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another , to supply the idea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their{443} communication with the collinses , the report , she concluded , had reached lady catherine , ) had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in revolving lady catherine s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , she added ,  - i shall know how to understand it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s curiosity; and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lizzy , said he ,  - i was going to look for you: come into my room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine , and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then said ,<s> <s>  - i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself , when her father continued ,{445}<s> <s>  - you look conscious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what can he have to say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - something very much to the purpose , of course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good - natured , gossiping lucases . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with everything the heart of mortal can most desire ,splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet , in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now it comes out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my motive for cautioning you is as follows:we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , you see , is the man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , lizzy , i think{446} i have surprised you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is admirable! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you not diverted? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent , that , on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , moreover , adds , i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was an encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them{447} in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  that is his notion of christian forgiveness! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are not going to be missish , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , cried elizabeth ,  - i am exceedingly diverted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s correspondence for any consideration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s indifference; and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that , perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much . </s> </s> 
{448}<s> <s> nstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gentlemen{449} arrived early; and , before mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy were to entertain each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they walked towards the lucases  , because kitty wished to call upon maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now was the moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was high , she immediately said ,<s> <s>  - mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , i am a very selfish creature , and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion ,  - that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did not think mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gardiner was so little to be trusted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must not blame my aunt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia s thoughtlessness{450} first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you will thank me , he replied ,  - let it be for yourself alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but your family owe me nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> much as i respect them , i believe i thought only of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth , feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak; and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they walked on without knowing in what direction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was too much to be thought , and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it taught me to hope , said he ,  - as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied ,  - yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what did you say of me that i did not deserve? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , said elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget: had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me; though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , do not repeat what i then said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these recollections will not do at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy mentioned his letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i knew , said he ,  - that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was one part , especially the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of{453} reading again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the adieu is charity itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but think no more of the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must learn some of my philosophy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of ignorance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but with me , it is not so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as a child i was taught what was right , but i was not taught to correct my temper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only child ) , i was spoiled by my parents , who , though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my{454} own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such i was , from eight to eight - and - twenty; and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i came to you without a doubt of my reception . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - had you then persuaded yourself that i should? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed i had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what will you think of my vanity? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , i assure you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you blamed me for coming? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , indeed , i felt nothing but surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my object then , replied darcy ,  - was to show you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how soon any other wishes introduced themselves , i can hardly{455} tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what could have become of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must ask whether you were surprised? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is to say , you had given your permission . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i guessed as much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on the evening before my going to london , said he ,  - i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had never had the slightest suspicion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i told him , moreover , that i{456} believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you speak from your own observation , said she ,  - when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from the former . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had narrowly observed her , during the two visits which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley is most unaffectedly modest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he was angry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth longed to observe that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at , and it was rather too early to begin . </s> </s> 
{457}<s> <s>  - y dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she coloured as she spoke; but neither that , nor anything else , awakened a suspicion of the truth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the evening passed quietly , unmarked by anything extraordinary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though suspicion was very far from miss bennet s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are joking , lizzy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this cannot be! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> engaged to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , no , you shall not deceive me: i know it to be impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is a wretched beginning , indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my sole dependence was on you; and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it cannot be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know how much you dislike him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know nothing of the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is all to be forgot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself . </s> </s> 
{459}<s> <s> miss bennet still looked all amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth again , and more seriously , assured her of its truth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good heaven! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet now i must believe you , cried jane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but are you pleased , jane? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very , very much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and do you really love him quite well enough? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , lizzy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do anything rather than marry without affection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am afraid you will be angry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i want to talk very seriously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me know everything that i am to know without delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another entreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment . </s> </s> 
{460}<s> <s>  - now i am quite happy , said she ,  - for you will be as happy as myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him; but now , as bingley s friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had been unwilling to mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good gracious! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning ,  - if that disagreeable mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had no notion but he would go a - shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what shall we do with him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud ,  - mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to - day? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i advise mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>{461} bennet ,  - to walk to oakham mount this morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a nice long walk , and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it may do very well for the others , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley;  - but i am sure it will be too much for kitty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> won t it , kitty? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kitty owned that she had rather stay at home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she went upstairs to get ready , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet followed her , saying ,<s> <s>  - i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself; but i hope you will not mind it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is all for jane s sake , you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was gone directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lizzy , said he ,  - what are you doing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you out of your senses to be accepting this man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have not you always hated him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - or , in other words , you are determined to have him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but will they make you happy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you any other objection , said elizabeth ,  - than your belief of my indifference? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - none at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do , i do like him , she replied , with tears in her eyes;  - i love him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed he has no improper pride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is perfectly amiable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lizzy , said her father ,  - i have given him my consent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i{463} should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know your disposition , lizzy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband , unless you looked up to him as a superior . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you could scarcely escape discredit and misery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months  suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , my dear , said he , when she ceased speaking ,  - i have no more to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if this be the case , he deserves you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to anyone less worthy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy had voluntarily done for lydia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is an evening of wonders , indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so , darcy did everything; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow s debts , and got him his commission! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so much the better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins s letter; and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go , saying , as she quitted the room ,  - if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and , after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when her mother went up to her dressing - room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> its effect was most extraordinary; for , on first hearing it , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard , though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good gracious! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lord bless me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only think! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dear me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , my sweetest lizzy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how rich and how great you will be! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane s is nothing to itnothing at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am so pleasedso happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such a charming man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so handsome! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so tall! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , my dear{465} lizzy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope he will overlook it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dear , dear lizzy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a house in town! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything that is charming! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , lord! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ten thousand a year , and very likely more! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and a special licenceyou must and shall be married by a special licence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , my dearest love , tell me what dish mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and elizabeth found that , though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations  consent , there was still something to be wished for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son - in - law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wickham , perhaps , is my favourite; but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how could you begin? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place? {467}<s> <s>  - i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is too long ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my mannersmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for the liveliness of your mind i did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may as well call it impertinence at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i roused and interested you , because i was so unlike them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who could have done less for her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but make a virtue of it by all means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i was embarrassed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and so was i . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a man who had felt less might . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this will never do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you need not distress yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my aunt s intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister was still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it ought to be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy had been overrated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars; but , to say the truth , i was too cross to write . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thank you again and again , for not going to the lakes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how could i be so{470} silly as to wish it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your idea of the ponies is delightful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will go round the park every day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am the happiest creature in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps other people have said so before , but no one with such justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style , and still different from either was what mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet sent to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collins , in return for his last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> console lady catherine as well as you can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has more to give . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jane was not deceived , but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the reason of this sudden{471} removal was soon evident . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> philips s vulgarity was another , and , perhaps , a greater tax on his forbearance; and though mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good - humour encouraged; yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley . </s> </s> 
{472}<s> <s> appy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley , and talked of mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected . </s> </s> 
{473}<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire; and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia; and , removed from the influence of lydia s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the further disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept; and though mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bennet s being quite unable to sit alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and{474} falsehood had before been unknown to her; and , in spite of everything , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you love mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses , she frequently sent them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were always moving from place to place{475} in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his affection for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and , in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though darcy could never receive him at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth s sake , he assisted him further in his profession . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath; and with the bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long , that even bingley s good - humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pemberley was now georgiana s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself . </s> </s> 
{476}<s> <s> lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them . </s> </s>
