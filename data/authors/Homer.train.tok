<s> <s> the points in question are: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ( 2 ) that the poem was entirely written by a very young woman , who lived at the place now called trapani , and introduced herself into her work under the name of nausicaa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the main arguments on which i base the first of these somewhat startling contentions , have been prominently and repeatedly before the english and italian public ever since they appeared ( without rejoinder ) in the  - athenaeum for january 30 and february 20 , 1892 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> both contentions were urged ( also without rejoinder ) in the johnian  - eagle for the lent and october terms of the same year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without , therefore , for a moment pretending to think that scholars generally acquiesce in my conclusions , i shall act as thinking them little likely so to gainsay me as that it will be incumbent upon me to reply , and shall confine myself to translating the  - odyssey for english readers , with such notes as i think will be found useful . </s> </s>

<s> <s> butcher and lang s translation of the sixty lines or so of the  - odyssey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , muse , of that man , so ready at need , who wandered far and wide , after he had sacked the sacred citadel of troy , and many were the men whose towns he saw and whose mind he learnt , yea , and many the woes he suffered in his heart on the deep , striving to win his own life and the return of his company . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nay , but even so he saved not his company , though he desired it sore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for through the blindness of their own hearts they perished , fools , who devoured the oxen of helios hyperion: but the god took from them their day of returning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of these things , goddess , daughter of zeus , whencesoever thou hast heard thereof , declare thou even unto us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> howbeit poseidon had now departed for the distant ethiopians , the ethiopians that are sundered in twain , the uttermost of men , abiding some where hyperion sinks and some where he rises . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams , there he made merry sitting at the feast , but the other gods were gathered in the halls of olympian zeus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thinking upon him he spake out among the immortals: lo you now , how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for of us they say comes evil , whereas they even of themselves , through the blindness of their own hearts , have sorrows beyond that which is ordained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even as of late aegisthus , beyond that which was ordained , took to him the wedded wife of the son of atreus , and killed her lord on his return , and that with sheer doom before his eyes , since we had warned him by the embassy of hermes the keen - sighted , the slayer of argos , that he should neither kill the man , nor woo his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so spake hermes , yet he prevailed not on the heart of aegisthus , for all his good will; but now hath he paid one price for all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and the goddess , grey - eyed athene , answered him , saying: o father , our father cronides , throned in the highest; that man assuredly lies in a death that is his due; so perish likewise all who work such deeds! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for thee , thine heart regardeth it not at all , olympian! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did not odysseus by the ships of the argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in the wide trojan land? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i found , however , that the translation would be thus hopelessly scholasticised , and abandoned my intention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would nevertheless urge on those who have the management of our university presses , that they would render a great service to students if they would publish a greek text of the  - odyssey with the iliadic passages printed in a different type , and with marginal references . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have given the british museum a copy of the  - odyssey with the iliadic passages underlined and referred to in ms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>; i have also given an  - iliad marked with all the odyssean passages , and their references; but copies of both the  - iliad and  - odyssey so marked ought to be within easy reach of all students . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> any one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen round the  - iliad since wolf s time , without keeping it well before his reader s mind that the  - odyssey was demonstrably written from one single neighbourhood , and hence ( even though nothing else pointed to this conclusion ) presumably by one person onlythat it was written certainly before 750 , and in all probability before 1000 b . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>c . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>that the writer of this very early poem was demonstrably familiar with the  - iliad as we now have it , borrowing as freely from those books whose genuineness has been most impugned , as from those which are admitted to be by homerany one who fails to keep these points before his readers , is hardly dealing equitably by them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> any one on the other hand , who will mark his  - iliad and his  - odyssey from the copies in the british museum above referred to , and who will draw the only inference that common sense can draw from the presence of so many identical passages in both poems , will , i believe , find no difficulty in assigning their proper value to a large number of books here and on the continent that at present enjoy considerable reputations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> furthermore , and this perhaps is an advantage better worth securing , he will find that many puzzles of the  - odyssey cease to puzzle him on the discovery that they arise from over - saturation with the  - iliad . </s> </s>

<s> <s> many cities did he visit , and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men , for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the sun - god hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , too , about all these things , oh daughter of jove , from whatsoever source you may know them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now neptune had gone off to the ethiopians , who are at the world s end , and lie in two halves , the one looking west and the other east . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[1] he had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen , and was enjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of olympian jove , and the sire of gods and men spoke first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at that moment he was thinking of aegisthus , who had been killed by agamemnon s son orestes; so he said to the other gods: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - see now , how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing but their own folly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look at aegisthus; he must needs make love to agamemnon s wife unrighteously and then kill agamemnon , though he knew it would be the death of him; for i sent mercury to warn him not to do either of these things , inasmuch as orestes would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercury told him this in all good will but he would not listen , and now he has paid for everything in full . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then minerva said ,  - father , son of saturn , king of kings , it served aegisthus right , and so it would any one else who does as he did; but aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for ulysses that my heart bleeds , when i think of his sufferings in that lonely sea - girt island , far away , poor man , from all his friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is an island covered with forest , in the very middle of the sea , and a goddess lives there , daughter of the magician atlas , who looks after the bottom of the ocean , and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this daughter of atlas has got hold of poor unhappy ulysses , and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home , so that he is tired of life , and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you , sir , take no heed of this , and yet when ulysses was before troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why then should you keep on being so angry with him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can i forget ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth , nor more liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> polyphemus is son to neptune by the nymph thoosa , daughter to the sea - king phorcys; therefore though he will not kill ulysses outright , he torments him by preventing him from getting home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , let us lay our heads together and see how we can help him to return; neptune will then be pacified , for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and minerva said ,  - father , son of saturn , king of kings , if , then , the gods now mean that ulysses should get home , we should first send mercury to the ogygian island to tell calypso that we have made up our minds and that he is to return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the meantime i will go to ithaca , to put heart into ulysses  son telemachus; i will embolden him to call the achaeans in assembly , and speak out to the suitors of his mother penelope , who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; i will also conduct him to sparta and to pylos , to see if he can hear anything about the return of his dear fatherfor this will make people speak well of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals , imperishable , with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the redoubtable bronze - shod spear , so stout and sturdy and strong , wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her , and down she darted from the topmost summits of olympus , whereon forthwith she was in ithaca , at the gateway of ulysses  house , disguised as a visitor , mentes , chief of the taphians , and she held a bronze spear in her hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus saw her long before any one else did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus brooding as he sat among them , he caught sight of minerva and went straight to the gate , for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took her right hand in his own , and bade her give him her spear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he led the way as he spoke , and minerva followed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they were within he took her spear and set it in the spear - stand against a strong bearing - post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father , and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a cloth of damask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a footstool also for her feet ,[2] and he set another seat near her for himself , away from the suitors , that she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence , and that he might ask her more freely about his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands , and she drew a clean table beside them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an upper servant brought them bread , and offered them many good things of what there was in the house , the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side , and a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted music and dancing , which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet , so a servant brought a lyre to phemius , whom they compelled perforce to sing to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing telemachus spoke low to minerva , with his head close to hers that no man might hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now , sir , tell me and tell me true , who you are and where you come from . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me of your town and parents , what manner of ship you came in , how your crew brought you to ithaca , and of what nation they declared themselves to befor you cannot have come by land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me also truly , for i want to know , are you a stranger to this house , or have you been here in my father s time? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the old days we had many visitors for my father went about much himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and minerva answered ,  - i will tell you truly and particularly all about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am mentes , son of anchialus , and i am king of the taphians . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have come here with my ship and crew , on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound for temesa[4] with a cargo of iron , and i shall bring back copper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for my ship , it lies over yonder off the open country away from the town , in the harbour rheithron[5] under the wooded mountain neritum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[6] our fathers were friends before us , as old laertes will tell you , if you will go and ask him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they say , however , that he never comes to town now , and lives by himself in the country , faring hardly , with an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him , when he comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they told me your father was at home again , and that was why i came , but it seems the gods are still keeping him back , for he is not dead yet not on the mainland . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is more likely he is on some sea - girt island in mid ocean , or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but tell me , and tell me true , can ulysses really have such a fine looking fellow for a son? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes , for we were close friends before he set sail for troy where the flower of all the argives went also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since that time we have never either of us seen the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but tell me , and tell me true , what is the meaning of all this feasting , and who are these people? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the guestshow atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person who comes near them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said telemachus ,  - as regards your question , so long as my father was here it was well with us and with the house , but the gods in their displeasure have willed it otherwise , and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our islands , dulichium , same , and the woodland island of zacynthus , as also all the principal men of ithaca itself , are eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to my mother , who will neither point blank say that she will not marry ,[7] nor yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate , and before long will do so also with myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed minerva ,  - then you do indeed want ulysses home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give him his helmet , shield , and a couple of lances , and if he is the man he was when i first knew him in our house , drinking and making merry , he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors , were he to stand once more upon his own threshold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ilus feared the ever - living gods and would not give him any , but my father let him have some , for he was very fond of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bid the suitors take themselves off , each to his own place , and if your mother s mind is set on marrying again , let her go back to her father , who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter may expect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for yourself , let me prevail upon you to take the best ship you can get , with a crew of twenty men , and go in quest of your father who has so long been missing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if on the other hand you hear of his death , come home at once , celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp , build a barrow to his memory , and make your mother marry again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , having done all this , think it well over in your mind how , by fair means or foul , you may kill these suitors in your own house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing orestes  praises for having killed his father s murderer aegisthus? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , however , i must go back to my ship and to my crew , who will be impatient if i keep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself , and remember what i have said to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , answered telemachus ,  - it has been very kind of you to talk to me in this way , as though i were your own son , and i will do all you tell me; i know you want to be getting on with your voyage , but stay a little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> minerva answered ,  - do not try to keep me , for i would be on my way at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for any present you may be disposed to make me , keep it till i come again , and i will take it home with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you shall give me a very good one , and i will give you one of no less value in return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt the change , wondered at it , and knew that the stranger had been a god , so he went straight to where the suitors were sitting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters[8] with a staid maiden on either side of her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she held a veil , moreover , before her face , and was weeping bitterly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - phemius , she cried ,  - you know many another feat of gods and heroes , such as poets love to celebrate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sing the suitors some one of these , and let them drink their wine in silence , but cease this sad tale , for it breaks my sorrowful heart , and reminds me of my lost husband whom i mourn ever without ceasing , and whose name was great over all hellas and middle argos . </s> </s> 
[9]<s> <s>  - mother , answered telemachus ,  - let the bard sing what he has a mind to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is jove , not they , who makes them , and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make up your mind to it and bear it; ulysses is not the only man who never came back from troy , but many another went down as well as he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go , then , within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties , your loom , your distaff , and the ordering of your servants; for speech is man s matter , and mine above all others [10]for it is i who am master here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she went wondering back into the house , and laid her son s saying in her heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , going upstairs with her handmaids into her room , she mourned her dear husband till minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then telemachus spoke ,  - shameless , he cried ,  - and insolent suitors , let us feast at our pleasure now , and let there be no brawling , for it is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as phemius has; but in the morning meet me in full assembly that i may give you formal notice to depart , and feast at one another s houses , turn and turn about , at your own cost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if on the other hand you choose to persist in spunging upon one man , heaven help me , but jove shall reckon with you in full , and when you fall in my father s house there shall be no man to avenge you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is this the worst fate you can think of for me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is no bad thing to be a chief , for it brings both riches and honour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , now that ulysses is dead there are many great men in ithaca both old and young , and some other may take the lead among them; nevertheless i will be chief in my own house , and will rule those whom ulysses has won for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then eurymachus , son of polybus , answered ,  - it rests with heaven to decide who shall be chief among us , but you shall be master in your own house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man in ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what country does he come from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has he brought you news about the return of your father , or was he on business of his own? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he seemed a well to do man , but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my father is dead and gone , answered telemachus ,  - and even if some rumour reaches me i put no more faith in it now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my mother does indeed sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him , but i give his prophecyings no heed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each in his own abode . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a good old woman , euryclea , daughter of ops , the son of pisenor , went before him with a couple of blazing torches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> laertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her , and shewed as much respect to her in his household as he did to his own wedded wife , but he did not take her to his bed for he feared his wife s resentment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[14] she it was who now lighted telemachus to his room , and she loved him better than any of the other women in the house did , for she had nursed him when he was a baby . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as he took off his shirt[15] he gave it to the good old woman , who folded it tidily up , and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side , after which she went out , pulled the door to by a silver catch , and drew the bolt home by means of the strap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[16] but telemachus as he lay covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage and of the counsel that minerva had given him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn , appeared telemachus rose and dressed himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he bound his sandals on to his comely feet , girded his sword about his shoulder , and left his room looking like an immortal god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he at once sent the criers round to call the people in assembly , so they called them and the people gathered thereon; then , when they were got together , he went to the place of assembly spear in handnot alone , for his two hounds went with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> aegyptius , a man bent double with age , and of infinite experience , was the first to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - men of ithaca , he said ,  - hear my words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the day ulysses left us there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then can it be , whether old or young , that finds it so necessary to convene us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sure he is an excellent person , and i hope jove will grant him his heart s desire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , turning to aegyptius ,  - sir , said he ,  - it is i , as you will shortly learn , who have convened you , for it is i who am the most aggrieved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have not got wind of any host approaching about which i would warn you , nor is there any matter of public moment on which i would speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my grievance is purely personal , and turns on two great misfortunes which have fallen upon my house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sons of all the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are afraid to go to her father icarius , asking him to choose the one he likes best , and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter , but day by day they keep hanging about my father s house , sacrificing our oxen , sheep , and fat goats for their banquets , and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall never all my days be as good a man as he was , still i would indeed defend myself if i had power to do so , for i cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have respect , therefore , to your own consciences and to public opinion . </s> </s> 
[19]<s> <s> with this telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into tears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every one was very sorry for him , but they all sat still and no one ventured to make him an angry answer , save only antinous , who spoke thus: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - telemachus , insolent braggart that you are , how dare you try to throw the blame upon us suitors? </s> </s>

<s> <s> and then there was that other trick she played us . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the people wondered as they saw them , and asked each other what all this might be; whereon halitherses , who was the best prophet and reader of omens among them , spoke to them plainly and in all honesty , saying: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses is not going to be away much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction , not on them alone , but on many another of us who live in ithaca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let the suitors do so of their own accord; it will be better for them , for i am not prophesying without due knowledge; everything has happened to ulysses as i foretold when the argives set out for troy , and he with them . </s> </s>

<s> <s> ulysses has died in a far country , and it is a pity you are not dead along with him , instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger of telemachus which is fierce enough as it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for telemachus , i warn him in the presence of you all to send his mother back to her father , who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then telemachus said ,  - eurymachus , and you other suitors , i shall say no more , and entreat you no further , for the gods and the people of ithaca now know my story . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i am not half so angry with the suitors , for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts , and wager their heads that ulysses will not return , they can take the high hand and eat up his estate , but as for you others i am shocked at the way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop such scandalous goings onwhich you could do if you chose , for you are many and they are few . </s> </s>

<s> <s> even though ulysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house , and do his best to oust us , his wife , who wants him back so very badly , would have small cause for rejoicing , and his blood would be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , therefore , do you people go about your business , and let his father s old friends , mentor and halitherses , speed this boy on his journey , if he goes at allwhich i do not think he will , for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes and tells him something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this he broke up the assembly , and every man went back to his own abode , while the suitors returned to the house of ulysses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hear me , he cried ,  - you god who visited me yesterday , and bade me sail the seas in search of my father who has so long been missing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would obey you , but the achaeans , and more particularly the wicked suitors , are hindering me that i cannot do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he thus prayed , minerva came close up to him in the likeness and with the voice of mentor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - telemachus , said she ,  - if you are made of the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward , for ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half done . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but mind you never make common cause with any of those foolish suitors , for they have neither sense nor virtue , and give no thought to death and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and all of them , so that they shall perish on the same day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , however , return home , and go about among the suitors; begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see everything well stowed , the wine in jars , and the barley meal , which is the staff of life , in leathern bags , while i go round the town and beat up volunteers at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went moodily home , and found the suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> antinous came up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own , saying ,  - telemachus , my fine fire - eater , bear no more ill blood neither in word nor deed , but eat and drink with us as you used to do . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i shall go , and my going will not be in vainthough , thanks to you suitors , i have neither ship nor crew of my own , and must be passenger not captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he snatched his hand from that of antinous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings ,[21] jeering at him tauntingly as they did so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - telemachus , said one youngster ,  - means to be the death of us; i suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from pylos , or again from sparta , where he seems bent on going . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or will he go to ephyra as well , for poison to put in our wine and kill us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another said ,  - perhaps if telemachus goes on board ship , he will be like his father and perish far from his friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this case we should have plenty to do , for we could then divide up his property amongst us: as for the house we can let his mother and the man who marries her have that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , too , there was a store of fragrant olive oil , while casks of old , well - ripened wine , unblended and fit for a god to drink , were ranged against the wall in case ulysses should come home again after all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the room was closed with well - made doors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house - keeper euryclea , daughter of ops the son of pisenor , was in charge of everything both night and day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus called her to the store - room and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nurse , draw me off some of the best wine you have , after what you are keeping for my father s own drinking , in case , poor man , he should escape death , and find his way home again after all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me have twelve jars , and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well - sewn leathern bags with barley mealabout twenty measures in all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when euryclea heard this she began to cry , and spoke fondly to him , saying ,  - my dear child , what ever can have put such notion as that into your head? </s> </s>

<s> <s> your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign country nobody knows where , and as soon as your back is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the way , and will share all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are among your own people , and do not go wandering and worrying your life out on the barren ocean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old woman swore most solemnly that she would not , and when she had completed her oath , she began drawing off the wine into jars , and getting the barley meal into the bags , while telemachus went back to the suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then minerva bethought her of another matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she went also to noemon son of phronius , and asked him to let her have a shipwhich he was very ready to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the sun had set and darkness was over all the land , she got the ship into the water , put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry , and stationed her at the end of the harbour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently the crew came up , and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she took the form and voice of mentor , and called telemachus to come outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - telemachus , said she ,  - the men are on board and at their oars , waiting for you to give your orders , so make haste and let us be off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this she led the way , while telemachus followed in her steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the men loosed the hawsers and took their places on the benches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> minerva sent them a fair wind from the west ,[22] that whistled over the deep blue waves[23] whereon telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail , and they did as he told them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they set the mast in its socket in the cross plank , raised it , and made it fast with the forestays; then they hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the sail bellied out with the wind , the ship flew through the deep blue water , and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , then , the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night from dark till dawn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus visits nestor at pylos . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as the sun was rising from the fair sea[24] into the firmament of heaven to shed light on mortals and immortals , they reached pylos the city of neleus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now the people of pylos were gathered on the sea shore to offer sacrifice of black bulls to neptune lord of the earthquake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were nine guilds with five hundred men in each , and there were nine bulls to each guild . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they were eating the inward meats[25] and burning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of neptune , telemachus and his crew arrived , furled their sails , brought their ship to anchor , and went ashore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> minerva led the way and telemachus followed her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beg of him to speak the truth , and he will tell no lies , for he is an excellent person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - some things , telemachus , answered minerva ,  - will be suggested to you by your own instinct , and heaven will prompt you further; for i am assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth until now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there they found nestor sitting with his sons , while his company round him were busy getting dinner ready , and putting pieces of meat on to the spits[26] while other pieces were cooking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they saw the strangers they crowded round them , took them by the hand and bade them take their places . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them into a golden cup , handing it to minerva first , and saluting her at the same time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - offer a prayer , sir , said he ,  - to king neptune , for it is his feast that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink offering , pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i doubt not that he too lifts his hands in prayer , for man cannot live without god in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still he is younger than you are , and is much of an age with myself , so i will give you the precedence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he handed her the cup . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> more especially we pray thee send down thy grace on nestor and on his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the pylian people some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she had thus made an end of praying , she handed the cup to telemachus and he prayed likewise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink , nestor , knight of gerene , began to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who , then , sir strangers , are you , and from what port have you sailed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or do you sail the seas as rovers with your hand against every man , and every man s hand against you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus answered boldly , for minerva had given him courage to ask about his father and get himself a good name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nestor , said he ,  - son of neleus , honour to the achaean name , you ask whence we come , and i will tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i seek news of my unhappy father ulysses , who is said to have sacked the town of troy in company with yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we know what fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at troy , but as regards ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is dead at all , for no one can certify us in what place he perished , nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland , or was lost at sea amid the waves of amphitrite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore i am suppliant at your knees , if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end , whether you saw it with your own eyes , or heard it from some other traveller , for he was a man born to trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not soften things out of any pity for me , but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friend , answered nestor ,  - you recall a time of much sorrow to my mind , for the brave achaeans suffered much both at sea , while privateering under achilles , and when fighting before the great city of king priam . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our best men all of them fell thereajax , achilles , patroclus peer of gods in counsel , and my own dear son antilochus , a man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but we suffered much more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though you were to stay here and question me for five years , or even six , i could not tell you all that the achaeans suffered , and you would turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nine long years did we try every kind of stratagem , but the hand of heaven was against us; during all this time there was no one who could compare with your father in subtletyif indeed you are his soni can hardly believe my eyesand you talk just like him toono one would say that people of such different ages could speak so much alike . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he and i never had any kind of difference from first to last neither in camp nor council , but in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the argives how all might be ordered for the best . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when , however , we had sacked the city of priam , and were setting sail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us , then jove saw fit to vex the argives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been either wise or understanding , and hence many came to a bad end through the displeasure of jove s daughter minerva , who brought about a quarrel between the two sons of atreus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fool that he was , he might have known that he would not prevail with her , for when the gods have made up their minds they do not change them lightly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the two stood bandying hard words , whereon the achaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the air , and were of two minds as to what they should do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that night we rested and nursed our anger , for jove was hatching mischief against us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in the morning some of us drew our ships into the water and put our goods with our women on board , while the rest , about half in number , stayed behind with agamemnon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wethe other halfembarked and sailed; and the ships went well , for heaven had smoothed the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we reached tenedos we offered sacrifices to the gods , for we were longing to get home; cruel jove , however , did not yet mean that we should do so , and raised a second quarrel in the course of which some among us turned their ships back again , and sailed away under ulysses to make their peace with agamemnon; but i , and all the ships that were with me pressed forward , for i saw that mischief was brewing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> later on menelaus joined us at lesbos , and found us making up our minds about our coursefor we did not know whether to go outside chios by the island of psyra , keeping this to our left , or inside chios , over against the stormy headland of mimas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this we therefore did , and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage during the night to geraestus ,[29] where we offered many sacrifices to neptune for having helped us so far on our way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> four days later diomed and his men stationed their ships in argos , but i held on for pylos , and the wind never fell light from the day when heaven first made it fair for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they say the myrmidons returned home safely under achilles  son neoptolemus; so also did the valiant son of poias , philoctetes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> idomeneus , again , lost no men at sea , and all his followers who escaped death in the field got safe home with him to crete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as orestes did , who killed false aegisthus the murderer of his noble father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nestor son of neleus , answered telemachus ,  - honour to the achaean name , the achaeans applaud orestes and his name will live through all time for he has avenged his father nobly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would that heaven might grant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors , who are ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no such happiness in store for me and for my father , so we must bear it as best we may . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friend , said nestor ,  - now that you remind me , i remember to have heard that your mother has many suitors , who are ill disposed towards you and are making havoc of your estate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you submit to this tamely , or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who knows but what ulysses may come back after all , and pay these scoundrels in full , either single - handed or with a force of achaeans behind him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she did to ulysses when we were fighting before troy ( for i never yet saw the gods so openly fond of any one as minerva then was of your father ) , if she would take as good care of you as she did of him , these wooers would soon some of them forget their wooing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus answered ,  - i can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far too much to hope for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i dare not let myself think of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even though the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would rather this , than get home quickly , and then be killed in my own house as agamemnon was by the treachery of aegisthus and his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , death is certain , and when a man s hour is come , not even the gods can save him , no matter how fond they are of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mentor , answered telemachus ,  - do not let us talk about it any more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no chance of my father s ever coming back; the gods have long since counselled his destruction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is something else , however , about which i should like to ask nestor , for he knows much more than any one else does . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they say he has reigned for three generations so that it is like talking to an immortal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , therefore , nestor , and tell me true; how did agamemnon come to die in that way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was menelaus doing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and how came false aegisthus to kill so far better a man than himself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will tell you truly , answered nestor ,  - and indeed you have yourself divined how it all happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if menelaus when he got back from troy had found aegisthus still alive in his house , there would have been no barrow heaped up for him , not even when he was dead , but he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures , and not a woman would have mourned him , for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but we were over there , fighting hard at troy , and aegisthus , who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of argos , cajoled agamemnon s wife clytemnestra with incessant flattery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme , for she was of a good natural disposition;[30] moreover there was a bard with her , to whom agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for troy , that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled her destruction , aegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten uponafter which she went willingly enough to the house of aegisthus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods , and decorated many temples with tapestries and gilding , for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we got to sunium , which is the point of athens , apollo with his painless shafts killed phrontis the steersman of menelaus  ship ( and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather ) so that he died then and there with the helm in his hand , and menelaus , though very anxious to press forward , had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently , when he too could put to sea again , and had sailed on as far as the malean heads , jove counselled evil against him and made it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here he divided his fleet and took the one half towards crete where the cydonians dwell round about the waters of the river iardanus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place called gortyn , and all along this part of the coast as far as phaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing , but after phaestus the coast is more protected , for a small headland can make a great shelter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the other five ships , they were taken by winds and seas to egypt , where menelaus gathered much gold and substance among people of an alien speech . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile aegisthus here at home plotted his evil deed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for seven years after he had killed agamemnon he ruled in mycene , and the people were obedient under him , but in the eighth year orestes came back from athens to be his bane , and killed the murderer of his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of false aegisthus by a banquet to the people of argos , and on that very day menelaus came home ,[31] with as much treasure as his ships could carry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take my advice then , and do not go travelling about for long so far from home , nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat up everything you have among them , and you will have been on a fool s errand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , i should advise you by all means to go and visit menelaus , who has lately come off a voyage among such distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from , when the winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelve - month , so vast and terrible are the seas that they must cross . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beg of him to speak the truth , and he will tell you no lies , for he is an excellent person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke the sun set and it came on dark , whereon minerva said ,  - sir , all that you have said is well; now , however , order the tongues of the victims to be cut , and mix wine that we may make drink - offerings to neptune , and the other immortals , and then go to bed , for it is bed time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men servants poured water over the hands of the guests , while pages filled the mixing - bowls with wine and water , and handed it round after giving every man his drink offering; then they threw the tongues of the victims into the fire , and stood up to make their drink offerings . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then minerva answered ,  - sir , you have spoken well , and it will be much better that telemachus should do as you have said; he , therefore , shall return with you and sleep at your house , but i must go back to give orders to my crew , and keep them in good heart . </s> </s>

<s> <s> on this they hurried off on their several errands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then stratius and echephron brought her in by the horns; aretus fetched water from the house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it , and in his other hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe , ready to strike the heifer , while perseus held a bucket . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then they lifted the heifer s head from off the ground , and pisistratus cut her throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they cut out the thigh bones all in due course , wrapped them round in two layers of fat , and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them , while the young men stood near him with five - pronged spits in their hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats , they cut the rest of the meat up small , put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile lovely polycaste , nestor s youngest daughter , washed telemachus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she had washed him and anointed him with oil , she brought him a fair mantle and shirt ,[33] and he looked like a god as he came from the bath and took his seat by the side of nestor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen , who kept pouring them out their wine in cups of gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink nestor said ,  - sons , put telemachus s horses to the chariot that he may start at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did he speak , and they did even as he had said , and yoked the fleet horses to the chariot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then telemachus got into the chariot , while pisistratus gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they reached pherae where diocles lived , who was son to ortilochus and grandson to alpheus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here they passed the night and diocles entertained them hospitably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn , appeared , they again yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they reached the low lying city of lacedaemon , where they drove straight to the abode of menelaus[36] [and found him in his own house , feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son , and also of his daughter , whom he was marrying to the son of that valiant warrior achilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had given his consent and promised her to him while he was still at troy , and now the gods were bringing the marriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses to the city of the myrmidons over whom achilles  son was reigning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for his only son he had found a bride from sparta ,[37] the daughter of alector . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this son , megapenthes , was born to him of a bondwoman , for heaven vouchsafed helen no more children after she had borne hermione , who was fair as golden venus herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the neighbours and kinsmen of menelaus were feasting and making merry in his house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre , while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up with his tune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went close up to him and said ,  - menelaus , there are some strangers come here , two men , who look like sons of jove . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are we to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they took their sweating steeds from under the yoke , made them fast to the mangers , and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard , and led the way into the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus and pisistratus were astonished when they saw it , for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon; then , when they had admired everything to their heart s content , they went into the bath room and washed themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a maid - servant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer , and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an upper servant brought them bread , and offered them many good things of what there was in the house , while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> menelaus then greeted them saying ,  - fall to , and welcome; when you have done supper i shall ask who you are , for the lineage of such men as you cannot have been lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must be descended from a line of sceptre - bearing kings , for poor people do not have such sons as you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this he handed them[39] a piece of fat roast loin , which had been set near him as being a prime part , and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink , telemachus said to the son of nestor , with his head so close that no one might hear ,  - look , pisistratus , man after my own heart , see the gleam of bronze and goldof amber ,[40] ivory , and silver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every one in that country , whether master or man , has plenty of cheese , meat , and good milk , for the ewes yield all the year round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but while i was travelling and getting great riches among these people , my brother was secretly and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife , so that i have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would that i had only a third of what i now have so that i had stayed at home , and all those were living who perished on the plain of troy , far from argos . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at times i cry aloud for sorrow , but presently i leave off again , for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet grieve for these as i may , i do so for one man more than for them all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot even think of him without loathing both food and sleep , so miserable does he make me , for no one of all the achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took nothing by it , and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself , for he has been gone a long time , and we know not whether he is alive or dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus spoke menelaus , and the heart of telemachus yearned as he bethought him of his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tears fell from his eyes as he heard him thus mentioned , so that he held his cloak before his face with both hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking , or to ask him at once and find what it was all about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was thus in two minds helen came down from her high vaulted and perfumed room , looking as lovely as diana herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> adraste brought her a seat , alcippe a soft woollen rug while phylo fetched her the silver work - box which alcandra wife of polybus had given her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> polybus lived in egyptian thebes , which is the richest city in the whole world; he gave menelaus two baths , both of pure silver , two tripods , and ten talents of gold; besides all this , his wife gave helen some beautiful presents , to wit , a golden distaff , and a silver work box that ran on wheels , with a gold band round the top of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> phylo now placed this by her side , full of fine spun yarn , and a distaff charged with violet coloured wool was laid upon the top of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then helen took her seat , put her feet upon the footstool , and began to question her husband . </s> </s> 
[42]<s> <s>  - do we know , menelaus , said she ,  - the names of these strangers who have come to visit us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall i guess right or wrong? but i cannot help saying what i think . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear wife , replied menelaus ,  - i see the likeness just as you do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , when i was talking about ulysses , and saying how much he had suffered on my account , tears fell from his eyes , and he hid his face in his mantle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father , nestor , sent me to escort him hither , for he wanted to know whether you could give him any counsel or suggestion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a son has always trouble at home when his father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this is how telemachus is now placed , for his father is absent , and there is no one among his own people to stand by him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bless my heart , replied menelaus ,  - then i am receiving a visit from the son of a very dear friend , who suffered much hardship for my sake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should have founded a city for him in argos , and built him a house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should have made him leave ithaca with his goods , his son , and all his people , and should have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities that are subject to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we should thus have seen one another continually , and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an intercourse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i suppose , however , that heaven grudged us such great good fortune , for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did he speak , and his words set them all a weeping . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thereon he said to menelaus ,<s> <s>  - sir , my father nestor , when we used to talk about you at home , told me you were a person of rare and excellent understanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if , then , it be possible , do as i would urge you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not fond of crying while i am getting my supper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is all we can do for the poor things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we can only shave our heads for them and wring the tears from our cheeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your discretion , my friend , answered menelaus ,  - is beyond your years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is plain you take after your father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will put an end therefore to all this weeping , and attend to our supper again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let water be poured over our hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this asphalion , one of the servants , poured water over their hands and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , every one in the whole country is a skilled physician , for they are of the race of paeeon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - menelaus , son of atreus , and you my good friends , sons of honourable men ( which is as jove wills , for he is the giver both of good and evil , and can do what he chooses ) , feast here as you will , and listen while i tell you a tale in season . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot indeed name every single one of the exploits of ulysses , but i can say what he did when he was before troy , and you achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he covered himself with wounds and bruises , dressed himself all in rags , and entered the enemy s city looking like a menial or a beggar , and quite different from what he did when he was among his own people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this disguise he entered the city of troy , and no one said anything to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i alone recognised him and began to question him , but he was too cunning for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when , however , i had washed and anointed him and had given him clothes , and after i had sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the trojans till he had got safely back to his own camp and to the ships , he told me all that the achaeans meant to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he killed many trojans and got much information before he reached the argive camp , for all which things the trojan women made lamentation , but for my own part i was glad , for my heart was beginning to yearn after my home , and i was unhappy about the wrong that venus had done me in taking me over there , away from my country , my girl , and my lawful wedded husband , who is indeed by no means deficient either in person or understanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have travelled much , and have had much to do with heroes , but i have never seen such another man as ulysses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what endurance too , and what courage he displayed within the wooden horse , wherein all the bravest of the argives were lying in wait to bring death and destruction upon the trojans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> diomed and i could not make up our minds whether to spring out then and there , or to answer you from inside , but ulysses held us all in check , so we sat quite still , all except anticlus , who was beginning to answer you , when ulysses clapped his two brawny hands over his mouth , and kept them there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how sad , exclaimed telemachus ,  - that all this was of no avail to save him , nor yet his own iron courage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now , sir , be pleased to send us all to bed , that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so the maids went out , carrying a torch , and made the beds , to which a man - servant presently conducted the strangers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , then , did telemachus and pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt , while the son of atreus lay in an inner room with lovely helen by his side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn appeared , menelaus rose and dressed himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he bound his sandals on to his comely feet , girded his sword about his shoulders , and left his room looking like an immortal god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , taking a seat near telemachus he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what , telemachus , has led you to take this long sea voyage to lacedaemon? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have come , sir , replied telemachus ,  - to see if you can tell me anything about my father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am being eaten out of house and home; my fair estate is being wasted , and my house is full of miscreants who keep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen , on the pretence of paying their addresses to my mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore , i am suppliant at your knees if haply you may tell me about my father s melancholy end , whether you saw it with your own eyes , or heard it from some other traveller; for he was a man born to trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not soften things out of any pity for myself , but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if my brave father ulysses ever did you loyal service either by word or deed , when you achaeans were harassed by the trojans , bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> menelaus on hearing this was very much shocked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , he exclaimed ,  - these cowards would usurp a brave man s bed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a hind might as well lay her new born young in the lair of a lion , and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair will make short work with the pair of themand so will ulysses with these suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by father jove , minerva , and apollo , if ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with philomeleides in lesbos , and threw him so heavily that all the achaeans cheered himif he is still such and were to come near these suitors , they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was trying to come on here , but the gods detained me in egypt , for my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction , and the gods are very strict about having their dues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now off egypt , about as far as a ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her , there is an island called pharosit has a good harbour from which vessels can get out into open sea when they have taken in waterand here the gods becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to help me forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she came to me one day when i was by myself , as i often was , for the men used to go with their barbed hooks , all over the island in the hope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stranger ,  said she , it seems to me that you like starving in this wayat any rate it does not greatly trouble you , for you stick here day after day , without even trying to get away though your men are dying by inches . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - let me tell you ,  said i , whichever of the goddesses you may happen to be , that i am not staying here of my own accord , but must have offended the gods that live in heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , therefore , for the gods know everything , which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in this way , and tell me also how i may sail the sea so as to reach my home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is proteus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is an egyptian , and people say he is my father; he is neptune s head man and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom of the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you can snare him and hold him tight , he will tell you about your voyage , what courses you are to take , and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - stranger ,  said she , i will make it all quite clear to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about the time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven , the old man of the sea comes up from under the waves , heralded by the west wind that furs the water over his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as he has come up he lies down , and goes to sleep in a great sea cave , where the sealshalosydne s chickens as they call themcome up also from the grey sea , and go to sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong and fish - like smell do they bring with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> [44] early to - morrow morning i will take you to this place and will lay you in ambush . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - first he will look over all his seals , and count them; then , when he has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers , he will go to sleep among them , as a shepherd among his sheep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he will turn himself into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth , and will become also both fire and water; but you must hold him fast and grip him tighter and tighter , till he begins to talk to you and comes back to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that is angry with you , and what you must do to reach your home over the seas . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - having so said she dived under the waves , whereon i turned back to the place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was clouded with care as i went along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i reached my ship we got supper ready , for night was falling , and camped down upon the beach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the goddess fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea , all of them just skinned , for she meant playing a trick upon her father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we were close to her , she made us lie down in the pits one after the other , and threw a seal skin over each of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our ambuscade would have been intolerable , for the stench of the fishy seals was most distressing[45]who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could help it? but here , too , the goddess helped us , and thought of something that gave us great relief , for she put some ambrosia under each man s nostrils , which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of the seals . </s> </s> 
[46]<s> <s>  - we waited the whole morning and made the best of it , watching the seals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore , till at noon the old man of the sea came up too , and when he had found his fat seals he went over them and counted them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we were among the first he counted , and he never suspected any guile , but laid himself down to sleep as soon as he had done counting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then we rushed upon him with a shout and seized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks , and changed himself first into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he became a dragon , a leopard , a wild boar; the next moment he was running water , and then again directly he was a tree , but we stuck to him and never lost hold , till at last the cunning old creature became distressed , and said , which of the gods was it , son of atreus , that hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizing me against my will? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do you want?  <s> <s>  - you know that yourself , old man ,  i answered , you will gain nothing by trying to put me off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am losing all heart; tell me , then , for you gods know everything , which of the immortals it is that is hindering me , and tell me also how i may sail the sea so as to reach my home?  <s> <s>  - then ,  he said , if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly , you must offer sacrifices to jove and to the rest of the gods before embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your friends , and to your own house , till you have returned to the heaven - fed stream of egypt , and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods that reign in heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you have done this they will let you finish your voyage . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i was broken hearted when i heard that i must go back all that long and terrible voyage to egypt;[47] nevertheless , i answered , i will do all , old man , that you have laid upon me; but now tell me , and tell me true , whether all the achaeans whom nestor and i left behind us when we set sail from troy have got home safely , or whether any one of them came to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends when the days of his fighting were done . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - son of atreus ,  he answered , why ask me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you had better not know what i can tell you , for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard my story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for what happened on the field of battleyou were there yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a third achaean leader is still at sea , alive , but hindered from returning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ajax was wrecked , for neptune drove him on to the great rocks of gyrae; nevertheless , he let him get safe out of the water , and in spite of all minerva s hatred he would have escaped death , if he had not ruined himself by boasting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the base remained where it was , but the part on which ajax was sitting fell headlong into the sea and carried ajax with it; so he drank salt water and was drowned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your brother and his ships escaped , for juno protected him , but when he was just about to reach the high promontory of malea , he was caught by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against his will , and drove him to the foreland where thyestes used to dwell , but where aegisthus was then living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man had been looking out for a whole year to make sure that agamemnon did not give him the slip and prepare war; when , therefore , this man saw agamemnon go by , he went and told aegisthus , who at once began to lay a plot for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he sent his chariots and horsemen to agamemnon , and invited him to the feast , but he meant foul play . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i sat down upon the sands and wept; i felt as though i could no longer bear to live nor look upon the light of the sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently , when i had had my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground , the old man of the sea said , son of atreus , do not waste any more time in crying so bitterly; it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you can , for aegisthus may be still alive , and even though orestes has been beforehand with you in killing him , you may yet come in for his funeral . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or is he dead? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , no matter how much it may grieve me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the third man ,  he answered , is ulysses who dwells in ithaca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph calypso , who is keeping him prisoner , and he cannot reach his home for he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for your own end , menelaus , you shall not die in argos , but the gods will take you to the elysian plain , which is at the ends of the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this will happen to you because you have married helen , and are jove s son - in - law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we reached the ships we got supper ready , for night was falling , and camped down upon the beach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn appeared , we drew our ships into the water , and put our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves , took our seats on the benches , and smote the grey sea with our oars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i again stationed my ships in the heaven - fed stream of egypt , and offered hecatombs that were full and sufficient . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i had thus appeased heaven s anger , i raised a barrow to the memory of agamemnon that his name might live for ever , after which i had a quick passage home , for the gods sent me a fair wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now for yourselfstay here some ten or twelve days longer , and i will then speed you on your way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will make you a noble present of a chariot and three horses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - son of atreus , replied telemachus ,  - do not press me to stay longer; i should be contented to remain with you for another twelve months; i find your conversation so delightful that i should never once wish myself at home with my parents; but my crew whom i have left at pylos are already impatient , and you are detaining me from them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> [48] none of our islands have much level ground , suitable for horses , and ithaca least of all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> menelaus smiled and took telemachus s hand within his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what you say , said he ,  - shows that you come of good family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i both can , and will , make this exchange for you , by giving you the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house . </s> </s>

<s> <s> what business had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the ocean like sea - horses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> does he want to die without leaving any one behind him to keep up his name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know , answered medon ,  - whether some god set him on to it , or whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if his father was dead , or alive and on his way home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were plenty of seats in the house , but she had no heart for sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house , both old and young , gathered round her and began to cry too , till at last in a transport of sorrow she exclaimed ,<s> <s>  - my dears , heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction than any other woman of my age and country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first i lost my brave and lion - hearted husband , who had every good quality under heaven , and whose name was great over all hellas and middle argos , and now my darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves , without my having heard one word about his leaving home . </s> </s>

<s> <s> do not trouble laertes: he has trouble enough already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , i cannot think that the gods hate the race of the son of arceisius so much , but there will be a son left to come up after him , and inherit both the house and the fair fields that lie far all round it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hear me , she cried ,  - daughter of aegis - bearing jove , unweariable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if ever ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or heifer , bear it in mind now as in my favour , and save my darling son from the villainy of the suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she cried aloud as she spoke , and the goddess heard her prayer; meanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister , and one of them said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was what they said , but they did not know what was going to happen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us be up and do that in silence , about which we are all of a mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they made the ship fast a little way out , came on shore again , got their suppers , and waited till night should fall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen hemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank into a slumber , and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion . </s> </s>

<s> <s> there is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have stand by his side , i mean minerva; it is she who has compassion upon you , and who has sent me to bear you this message . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then it vanished through the thong - hole of the door and was dissipated into thin air; but penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted , so vivid had been her dream . </s> </s>

<s> <s> calypsoulysses reaches scheria on a raft . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now , as dawn rose from her couch beside tithonusharbinger of light alike to mortals and immortalsthe gods met in council and with them , jove the lord of thunder , who is their king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father jove , said she ,  - and all you other gods that live in everlasting bliss , i hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and well - disposed ruler any more , nor one who will govern equitably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope they will be all henceforth cruel and unjust , for there is not one of his subjects but has forgotten ulysses , who ruled them as though he were their father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there he is , lying in great pain in an island where dwells the nymph calypso , who will not let him go; and he cannot get back to his own country , for he can find neither ships nor sailors to take him over the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , my dear , are you talking about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied her father ,  - did you not send him there yourself , because you thought it would help ulysses to get home and punish the suitors? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , you are perfectly able to protect telemachus , and to see him safely home again , while the suitors have to come hurry - skurrying back without having killed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had thus spoken , he said to his son mercury ,  - mercury , you are our messenger , go therefore and tell calypso we have decreed that poor ulysses is to return home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is how we have settled that he shall return to his country and his friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus he spoke , and mercury , guide and guardian , slayer of argus , did as he was told . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he flew and flew over many a weary wave , but when at last he got to the island which was his journey s end , he left the sea and went on by land till he came to the cave where the nymph calypso lived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found her at home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a large fire burning on the hearth , and one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for herself , she was busy at her loom , shooting her golden shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a vine loaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of the cave; there were also four running rills of water in channels cut pretty close together , and turned hither and thither so as to irrigate the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> [51] even a god could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot , so mercury stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it sufficiently he went inside the cave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> calypso gave mercury a seat and said:  - why have you come to see me , mercuryhonoured , and ever welcomefor you do not visit me often? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> say what you want; i will do it for you at once if i can , and if it can be done at all; but come inside , and let me set refreshment before you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed him some red nectar , so mercury ate and drank till he had had enough , and then said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we are speaking god and goddess to one another , and you ask me why i have come here , and i will tell you truly as you would have me do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jove sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all this way over the sea where there are no cities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice hecatombs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on their way home they sinned against minerva ,[52] who raised both wind and waves against them , so that all his brave companions perished , and he alone was carried hither by wind and tide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> calypso trembled with rage when she heard this ,  - you gods , she exclaimed ,  - ought to be ashamed of yourselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so when rosy - fingered dawn made love to orion , you precious gods were all of you furious till diana went and killed him in ortygia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so again when ceres fell in love with iasion , and yielded to him in a thrice - ploughed fallow field , jove came to hear of it before so very long and killed iasion with his thunderbolts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now you are angry with me too because i have a man here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i found the poor creature sitting all alone astride of a keel , for jove had struck his ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean , so that all his crew were drowned , while he himself was driven by wind and waves on to my island . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless i will readily give him such advice , in all good faith , as will be likely to bring him safely to his own country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then send him away , said mercury ,  - or jove will be angry with you and punish you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she found him sitting upon the beach with his eyes ever filled with tears , and dying of sheer home sickness; for he had got tired of calypso , and though he was forced to sleep with her in the cave by night , it was she , not he , that would have it so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the day time , he spent it on the rocks and on the sea shore , weeping , crying aloud for his despair , and always looking out upon the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> calypso then went close up to him said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my poor fellow , you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life out any longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am going to send you away of my own free will; so go , cut some beams of wood , and make yourself a large raft with an upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will put bread , wine , and water on board to save you from starving . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will also give you clothes , and will send you a fair wind to take you home , if the gods in heaven so will itfor they know more about these things , and can settle them better than i can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses shuddered as he heard her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now goddess , he answered ,  - there is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not even a well found ship with a fair wind could venture on such a distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall make me go on board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no mischief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> calypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand:  - you know a great deal , said she ,  - but you are quite wrong here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am dealing with you quite straightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron , and i am very sorry for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him , and ulysses followed in her steps; so the pair , goddess and man , went on and on till they came to calypso s cave , where ulysses took the seat that mercury had just left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink , calypso spoke , saying: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ulysses , noble son of laertes , so you would start home to your own land at once? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - goddess , replied ulysses ,  - do not be angry with me about this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am quite aware that my wife penelope is nothing like so tall or so beautiful as yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is only a woman , whereas you are an immortal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless , i want to get home , and can think of nothing else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if some god wrecks me when i am on the sea , i will bear it and make the best of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have had infinite trouble both by land and sea already , so let this go with the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently the sun set and it became dark , whereon the pair retired into the inner part of the cave and went to bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the child of morning rosy - fingered dawn appeared , ulysses put on his shirt and cloak , while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer fabric , very fine and graceful , with a beautiful golden girdle about her waist and a veil to cover her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she gave him a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides , and had a beautiful olive - wood handle fitted firmly on to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she also gave him a sharp adze , and then led the way to the far end of the island where the largest trees grewalder , poplar and pine , that reached the skyvery dry and well seasoned , so as to sail light for him in the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[53] then , when she had shown him where the best trees grew , calypso went home , leaving him to cut them , which he soon finished doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth , squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made the raft as broad as a skilled shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel , and he fixed a deck on top of the ribs , and ran a gunwale all round it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he also made a mast with a yard arm , and a rudder to steer with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves , and then he threw on a quantity of wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> last of all , with the help of levers , he drew the raft down into the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she gave him a goat skin full of black wine , and another larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions , and found him in much good meat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , she made the wind fair and warm for him , and gladly did ulysses spread his sail before it , while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he never closed his eyes , but kept them fixed on the pleiads , on late - setting bootes , and on the bearwhich men also call the wain , and which turns round and round where it is , facing orion , and alone never dipping into the stream of oceanusfor calypso had told him to keep this to his left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> days seven and ten did he sail over the sea , and on the eighteenth the dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of the phaeacian coast appeared , rising like a shield on the horizon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but king neptune , who was returning from the ethiopians , caught sight of ulysses a long way off , from the mountains of the solymi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thereon he gathered his clouds together , grasped his trident , stirred it round in the sea , and roused the rage of every wind that blows till earth , sea , and sky were hidden in cloud , and night sprang forth out of the heavens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> winds from east , south , north , and west fell upon him all at the same time , and a tremendous sea got up , so that ulysses  heart began to fail him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , he said to himself in his dismay ,  - what ever will become of me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am afraid calypso was right when she said i should have trouble by sea before i got back home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how black is jove making heaven with his clouds , and what a sea the winds are raising from every quarter at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> blest and thrice blest were those danaans who fell before troy in the cause of the sons of atreus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would that i had been killed on the day when the trojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of achilles , for then i should have had due burial and the achaeans would have honoured my name; but now it seems that i shall come to a most pitiable end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft reeled again , and he was carried overboard a long way off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he let go the helm , and the force of the hurricane was so great that it broke the mast half way up , and both sail and yard went over into the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in spite of all this , however , he did not lose sight of his raft , but swam as fast as he could towards it , got hold of it , and climbed on board again so as to escape drowning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sea took the raft and tossed it about as autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was as though the south , north , east , and west winds were all playing battledore and shuttlecock with it at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he was in this plight , ino daughter of cadmus , also called leucothea , saw him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had formerly been a mere mortal , but had been since raised to the rank of a marine goddess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing in what great distress ulysses now was , she had compassion upon him , and , rising like a sea - gull from the waves , took her seat upon the raft . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my poor good man , said she ,  - why is neptune so furiously angry with you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is giving you a great deal of trouble , but for all his bluster he will not kill you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you seem to be a sensible person , do then as i bid you; strip , leave your raft to drive before the wind , and swim to the phaeacian coast where better luck awaits you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and here , take my veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted , and you can come to no harm so long as you wear it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these words she took off her veil and gave it him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she dived down again like a sea - gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but ulysses did not know what to think . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , he said to himself in his dismay ,  - this is only some one or other of the gods who is luring me to ruin by advising me to quit my raft . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know what i will doi am sure it will be bestno matter what happens i will stick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together , but when the sea breaks her up i will swim for it; i do not see how i can do any better than this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon it as if he were on horseback; he then took off the clothes calypso had given him , bound ino s veil under his arms , and plunged into the seameaning to swim on shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> king neptune watched him as he did so , and wagged his head , muttering to himself and saying ,  - there now , swim up and down as you best can till you fall in with well - to - do people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not think you will be able to say that i have let you off too lightly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this he lashed his horses and drove to aegae where his palace is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water , with a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when the third day broke , the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so much as a breath of air stirring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when , however , he got within earshot , he began to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks , for the swell still broke against them with a terrific roar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses  heart now began to fail him , and he said despairingly to himself ,  - alas , jove has let me see land after swimming so far that i had given up all hope , but i can find no landing place , for the coast is rocky and surf - beaten , the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea , with deep water close under them so that i cannot climb out for want of foot hold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs and dash me against the rocks as i leave the waterwhich would give me a sorry landing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if , on the other hand , i swim further in search of some shelving beach or harbour , a hurricane may carry me out to sea again sorely against my will , or heaven may send some great monster of the deep to attack me; for amphitrite breeds many such , and i know that neptune is very angry with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to pieces if minerva had not shown him what to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he swam seaward again , beyond reach of the surf that was beating against the land , and at the same time he kept looking towards the shore to see if he could find some haven , or a spit that should take the waves aslant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by and by , as he swam on , he came to the mouth of a river , and here he thought would be the best place , for there were no rocks , and it afforded shelter from the wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt that there was a current , so he prayed inwardly and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hear me , o king , whoever you may be , and save me from the anger of the sea - god neptune , for i approach you prayerfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> any one who has lost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods , wherefore in my distress i draw near to your stream , and cling to the knees of your riverhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have mercy upon me , o king , for i declare myself your suppliant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the god staid his stream and stilled the waves , making all calm before him , and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here at last ulysses  knees and strong hands failed him , for the sea had completely broken him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his body was all swollen , and his mouth and nostrils ran down like a river with sea - water , so that he could neither breathe nor speak , and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently , when he had got his breath and came to himself again , he took off the scarf that ino had given him and threw it back into the salt[54] stream of the river , whereon ino received it into her hands from the wave that bore it towards her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he left the river , laid himself down among the rushes , and kissed the bounteous earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , he cried to himself in his dismay ,  - what ever will become of me , and how is it all to end? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i stay here upon the river bed through the long watches of the night , i am so exhausted that the bitter cold and damp may make an end of mefor towards sunrise there will be a keen wind blowing from off the river . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if , on the other hand , i climb the hill side , find shelter in the woods , and sleep in some thicket , i may escape the cold and have a good night s rest , but some savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the end he deemed it best to take to the woods , and he found one upon some high ground not far from the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there he crept beneath two shoots of olive that grew from a single stockthe one an ungrafted sucker , while the other had been grafted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses crept under these and began to make himself a bed to lie on , for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying aboutenough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard winter weather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was glad enough to see this , so he laid himself down and heaped the leaves all round him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the meeting between nausicaa and ulysses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so here ulysses slept , overcome by sleep and toil; but minerva went off to the country and city of the phaeaciansa people who used to live in the fair town of hypereia , near the lawless cyclopes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now the cyclopes were stronger than they and plundered them , so their king nausithous moved them thence and settled them in scheria , far from all other people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he surrounded the city with a wall , built houses and temples , and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone to the house of hades , and king alcinous , whose counsels were inspired of heaven , was now reigning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there slept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess , nausicaa , daughter to king alcinous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> minerva took the form of the famous sea captain dymas s daughter , who was a bosom friend of nausicaa and just her own age; then , coming up to the girl s bedside like a breath of wind , she hovered over her head and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here are your clothes all lying in disorder , yet you are going to be married almost immediately , and should not only be well dressed yourself , but should find good clothes for those who attend you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suppose , then , that we make tomorrow a washing day , and start at daybreak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will come and help you so that you may have everything ready as soon as possible , for all the best young men among your own people are courting you , and you are not going to remain a maid much longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ask your father , therefore , to have a waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak , to take the rugs , robes , and girdles , and you can ride , too , which will be much pleasanter for you than walking , for the washing - cisterns are some way from the town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she had said this minerva went away to olympus , which they say is the everlasting home of the gods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here no wind beats roughly , and neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine and in a great peacefulness of light , wherein the blessed gods are illumined for ever and ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by and by morning came and woke nausicaa , who began wondering about her dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell her father and mother all about it , and found them in their own room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her maids around her , and she happened to catch her father just as he was going out to attend a meeting of the town council , which the phaeacian aldermen had convened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she stopped him and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - papa dear , could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i want to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , you have five sons at home , two of them married , while the other three are good looking bachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen when they go to a dance , and i have been thinking about all this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be off with you , and the men shall get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold all your clothes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this he gave his orders to the servants , who got the waggon out , harnessed the mules , and put them to , while the girl brought the clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her mother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good things , and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon , and her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil , that she and her women might anoint themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she took the whip and reins and lashed the mules on , whereon they set off , and their hoofs clattered on the road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they pulled without flagging , and carried not only nausicaa and her wash of clothes , but the maids also who were with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they reached the water side they went to the washing cisterns , through which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any quantity of linen , no matter how dirty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they took the clothes out of the waggon , put them in the water , and vied with one another in treading them in the pits to get the dirt out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after they had washed them and got them quite clean , they laid them out by the sea side , where the waves had raised a high beach of shingle , and set about washing themselves and anointing themselves with olive oil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they got their dinner by the side of the stream , and waited for the sun to finish drying the clothes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the huntress diana goes forth upon the mountains of taygetus or erymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer , and the wood nymphs , daughters of aegis - bearing jove , take their sport along with her ( then is leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a full head taller than the others , and eclipse the loveliest amid a whole bevy of beauties ) , even so did the girl outshine her handmaids . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when it was time for them to start home , and they were folding the clothes and putting them into the waggon , minerva began to consider how ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct him to the city of the phaeacians . </s> </s>

<s> <s> on this they all shouted , and the noise they made woke ulysses , who sat up in his bed of leaves and began to wonder what it might all be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are they cruel , savage , and uncivilised , or hospitable and humane? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - if , therefore , you want my father to give you an escort and to help you home , do as i bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by the road side dedicated to minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow all round it . </s> </s>

<s> <s> so saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mules drew well , and their hoofs went up and down upon the road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove of minerva , and there ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter of jove . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when she reached her father s house she drew up at the gateway , and her brotherscomely as the godsgathered round her , took the mules out of the waggon , and carried the clothes into the house , while she went to her own room , where an old servant , eurymedusa of apeira , lit the fire for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this old woman had been brought by sea from apeira , and had been chosen as a prize for alcinous because he was king over the phaeacians , and the people obeyed him as though he were a god . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - my dear , will you be so kind as to show me the house of king alcinous? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am an unfortunate foreigner in distress , and do not know one in your town and country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then minerva said ,  - yes , father stranger , i will show you the house you want , for alcinous lives quite close to my own father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will go before you and show the way , but say not a word as you go , and do not look at any man , nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide strangers , and do not like men who come from some other place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are a sea - faring folk , and sail the seas by the grace of neptune in ships that glide along like thought , or as a bird in the air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this she led the way , and ulysses followed in her steps; but not one of the phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the midst of them; for the great goddess minerva in her good will towards him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he admired their harbours , ships , places of assembly , and the lofty walls of the city , which , with the palisade on top of them , were very striking , and when they reached the king s house minerva said: </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - neptune , however , lay with his daughter , and she had a son by him , the great nausithous , who reigned over the phaeacians . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nausithous had two sons rhexenor and alcinous;[58] apollo killed the first of them while he was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter arete , whom alcinous married , and honours as no other woman is honoured of all those that keep house along with their husbands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you can gain her good will , you may have every hope of seeing your friends again , and getting safely back to your home and country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then minerva left scheria and went away over the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the walls on either side were of bronze from end to end , and the cornice was of blue enamel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here the chief persons of the phaeacians used to sit and eat and drink , for there was abundance at all seasons; and there were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in their hands , raised on pedestals , to give light by night to those who were at table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the phaeacians are the best sailors in the world , so their women excel all others in weaving , for minerva has taught them all manner of useful arts , and they are very intelligent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about four acres with a wall all round it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is full of beautiful treespears , pomegranates , and the most delicious apples . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so here ulysses stood for a while and looked about him , but when he had looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the precincts of the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - queen arete , he exclaimed ,  - daughter of great rhexenor , in my distress i humbly pray you , as also your husband and these your guests ( whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness , and may they leave their possessions to their children , and all the honours conferred upon them by the state ) to help me home to my own country as soon as possible; for i have been long in trouble and away from my friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their peace , till presently the old hero echeneus , who was an excellent speaker and an elder among the phaeacians , plainly and in all honesty addressed them thus: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a maid servant then brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for him to wash his hands , and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there was in the house , and ulysses ate and drank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then alcinous said to one of the servants ,  - pontonous , mix a cup of wine and hand it round that we may make drink - offerings to jove the lord of thunder , who is the protector of all well - disposed suppliants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pontonous then mixed wine and water , and handed it round after giving every man his drink - offering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had made their offerings , and had drunk each as much as he was minded , alcinous said: </s> </s>

<s> <s> you have had your supper , so now go home to bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we must see that he comes to no harm while on his homeward journey , but when he is once at home he will have to take the luck he was born with for better or worse like other people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves , and if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other of them , they affect no concealment , for we are as near of kin to the gods as the cyclopes and the savage giants are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have nothing of the immortal about me , neither in body nor mind , and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , were i to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me , you would say that i was still worse off than they are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless , let me sup in spite of sorrow , for an empty stomach is a very importunate thing , and thrusts itself on a man s notice no matter how dire is his distress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am in great trouble , yet it insists that i shall eat and drink , bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only on the due replenishing of itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for yourselves , do as you propose , and at break of day set about helping me to get home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall be content to die if i may first once more behold my property , my bondsmen , and all the greatness of my house . </s> </s> 
[63]<s> <s> thus did he speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every one approved his saying , and agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then when they had made their drink offerings , and had drunk each as much as he was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode , leaving ulysses in the cloister with arete and alcinous while the servants were taking the things away after supper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> arete was the first to speak , for she recognised the shirt , cloak , and good clothes that ulysses was wearing , as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said ,  - stranger , before we go any further , there is a question i should like to ask you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who , and whence are you , and who gave you those clothes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and ulysses answered ,  - it would be a long story madam , were i to relate in full the tale of my misfortunes , for the hand of heaven has been laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question , there is an island far away in the sea which is called the ogygian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  here dwells the cunning and powerful goddess calypso , daughter of atlas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she lives by herself far from all neighbours human or divine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she took me in and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me immortal that i might never grow old , but she could not persuade me to let her do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she sent me from her island on a raft , which she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover she gave me good stout clothing , and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> days seven and ten did i sail over the sea , and on the eighteenth i caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coastand glad indeed was i to set eyes upon them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there i tried to land , but could not , for it was a bad place and the waves dashed me against the rocks , so i again took to the sea and swam on till i came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place , for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , then , i got out of the water and gathered my senses together again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> night was coming on , so i left the river , and went into a thicket , where i covered myself all over with leaves , and presently heaven sent me off into a very deep sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sick and sorry as i was i slept among the leaves all night , and through the next day till afternoon , when i woke as the sun was westering , and saw your daughter s maid servants playing upon the beach , and your daughter among them looking like a goddess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i besought her aid , and she proved to be of an excellent disposition , much more so than could be expected from so young a personfor young people are apt to be thoughtless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she gave me plenty of bread and wine , and when she had had me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which you see me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , therefore , though it has pained me to do so , i have told you the whole truth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then alcinous said ,  - stranger , it was very wrong of my daughter not to bring you on at once to my house along with the maids , seeing that she was the first person whose aid you asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pray do not scold her , replied ulysses;  - she is not to blame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she did tell me to follow along with the maids , but i was ashamed and afraid , for i thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stranger , replied alcinous ,  - i am not the kind of man to get angry about nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by father jove , minerva , and apollo , now that i see what kind of person you are , and how much you think as i do , i wish you would stay here , marry my daughter , and become my son - in - law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you will stay i will give you a house and an estate , but no one ( heaven forbid ) shall keep you here against your own wish , and that you may be sure of this i will attend tomorrow to the matter of your escort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can sleep[64] during the whole voyage if you like , and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own home , or wherever you please , even though it be a long way further off than euboea , which those of my people who saw it when they took yellow - haired rhadamanthus to see tityus the son of gaia , tell me is the furthest of any placeand yet they did the whole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves , and came back again afterwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will thus see how much my ships excel all others , and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then arete told her maids to set a bed in the room that was in the gatehouse , and make it with good red rugs , and to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for ulysses to wear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the maids thereon went out with torches in their hands , and when they had made the bed they came up to ulysses and said ,  - rise , sir stranger , and come with us for your bed is ready , and glad indeed was he to go to his rest . </s> </s>

<s> <s> now when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn , appeared , alcinous and ulysses both rose , and alcinous led the way to the phaeacian place of assembly , which was near the ships . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they got there they sat down side by side on a seat of polished stone , while minerva took the form of one of alcinous  servants , and went round the town in order to help ulysses to get home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she went up to the citizens , man by man , and said ,  - aldermen and town councillors of the phaeacians , come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has just come off a long voyage to the house of king alcinous; he looks like an immortal god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these words she made them all want to come , and they flocked to the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every one was struck with the appearance of ulysses , for minerva had beautified him about the head and shoulders , making him look taller and stouter than he really was , that he might impress the phaeacians favourably as being a very remarkable man , and might come off well in the many trials of skill to which they would challenge him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us then get one ready for him , as we have done for others before him; indeed , no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us draw a ship into the seaone that has never yet made a voyageand man her with two and fifty of our smartest young sailors . </s> </s>

<s> <s> alcinous then led the way , and the others followed after , while a servant went to fetch demodocus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fifty - two picked oarsmen went to the sea shore as they had been told , and when they got there they drew the ship into the water , got her mast and sails inside her , bound the oars to the thole - pins with twisted thongs of leather , all in due course , and spread the white sails aloft . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they moored the vessel a little way out from land , and then came on shore and went to the house of king alcinous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the out houses ,[66] yards , and all the precincts were filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and alcinous killed them a dozen sheep , eight full grown pigs , and two oxen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent banquet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a servant presently led in the famous bard demodocus , whom the muse had dearly loved , but to whom she had given both good and evil , for though she had endowed him with a divine gift of song , she had robbed him of his eyesight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pontonous set a seat for him among the guests , leaning it up against a bearing - post . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he also set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side , and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before them , but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink , the muse inspired demodocus to sing the feats of heroes , and more especially a matter that was then in the mouths of all men , to wit , the quarrel between ulysses and achilles , and the fierce words that they heaped on one another as they sat together at a banquet . </s> </s>

<s> <s> with these words he led the way , and the others followed after . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a servant hung demodocus s lyre on its peg for him , led him out of the cloister , and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief men of the phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of several thousands of people followed them , and there were many excellent competitors for all the prizes . </s> </s>

<s> <s> clytoneus came in first by a long way; he left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a couple of mules can plough in a fallow field . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[67] they then turned to the painful art of wrestling , and here euryalus proved to be the best man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alcinous s son laodamas was the best boxer , and he it was who presently said , when they had all been diverted with the games ,  - let us ask the stranger whether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs , calves , hands , and neck are of prodigious strength , nor is he at all old , but he has suffered much lately , and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man , no matter how strong he is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd and said to ulysses ,  - i hope , sir , that you will enter yourself for some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of themand you must have gone in for many a one before now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have a try therefore at something , and banish all sorrow from your mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses answered ,  - laodamas , why do you taunt me in this way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my mind is set rather on cares than contests; i have been through infinite trouble , and am come among you now as a suppliant , praying your king and people to further me on my return home . </s> </s>

<s> <s> now , however , i am worn out by labour and sorrow , for i have gone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still , in spite of all this i will compete , for your taunts have stung me to the quick . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it sped gracefully from his hand , and flew beyond any mark that had been made yet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a blind man , sir , said she ,  - could easily tell your mark by groping for itit is so far ahead of any other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers - on , so he began to speak more pleasantly . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this in fact was how eurytus came prematurely by his end , for apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> running is the only point in respect of which i am afraid some of the phaeacians might beat me , for i have been brought down very low at sea; my provisions ran short , and therefore i am still weak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they all held their peace except king alcinous , who began ,  - sir , we have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us , from which i understand that you are willing to show your prowess , as having been displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one of our athletes , and which could never have been uttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are not particularly remarkable for our boxing , nor yet as wrestlers , but we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellent sailors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king s house , and the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was their business to manage everything connected with the sports , so they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently the servant came back with demodocus s lyre , and he took his place in the midst of them , whereon the best young dancers in the town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that ulysses was delighted with the merry twinkling of their feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of mars and venus , and how they first began their intrigue in the house of vulcan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mars made venus many presents , and defiled king vulcan s marriage bed , so the sun , who saw what they were about , told vulcan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vulcan was very angry when he heard such dreadful news , so he went to his smithy brooding mischief , got his great anvil into its place , and began to forge some chains which none could either unloose or break , so that they might stay there in that place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[69] when he had finished his snare he went into his bedroom and festooned the bed - posts all over with chains like cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not even a god could see them so fine and subtle were they . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as he had spread the chains all over the bed , he made as though he were setting out for the fair state of lemnos , which of all places in the world was the one he was most fond of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but mars kept no blind look out , and as soon as he saw him start , hurried off to his house , burning with love for venus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now venus was just come in from a visit to her father jove , and was about sitting down when mars came inside the house , and said as he took her hand in his own ,  - let us go to the couch of vulcan: he is not at home , but is gone off to lemnos among the sintians , whose speech is barbarous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was nothing loth , so they went to the couch to take their rest , whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning vulcan had spread for them , and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot , but found too late that they were in a trap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father jove , he cried ,  - and all you other blessed gods who live for ever , come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that i will show you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jove s daughter venus is always dishonouring me because i am lame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is in love with mars , who is handsome and clean built , whereas i am a cripplebut my parents are to blame for that , not i; they ought never to have begotten me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come and see the pair together asleep on my bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it makes me furious to look at them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this the gods gathered to the house of vulcan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> earth - encircling neptune came , and mercury the bringer of luck , and king apollo , but the goddesses staid at home all of them for shame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the givers of all good things stood in the doorway , and the blessed gods roared with inextinguishable laughter , as they saw how cunning vulcan had been , whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ill deeds do not prosper , and the weak confound the strong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did they converse , but king apollo said to mercury ,  - messenger mercury , giver of good things , you would not care how strong the chains were , would you , if you could sleep with venus? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him , but neptune took it all seriously , and kept on imploring vulcan to set mars free again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let him go , he cried ,  - and i will undertake , as you require , that he shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among the immortal gods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not , replied vulcan ,  - ask me to do this; a bad man s bond is bad security; what remedy could i enforce against you if mars should go away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so vulcan answered ,  - in this case i cannot and must not refuse you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them , and as soon as they were free they scampered off , mars to thrace and laughter - loving venus to cyprus and to paphos , where is her grove and her altar fragrant with burnt offerings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus sang the bard , and both ulysses and the seafaring phaeacians were charmed as they heard him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then alcinous told laodamas and halius to dance alone , for there was no one to compete with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so they took a red ball which polybus had made for them , and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up towards the clouds , while the other jumped from off the ground and caught it with ease before it came down again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had done throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance , and at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one another , while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great stamping with their feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - king alcinous , you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the world , and indeed they have proved themselves to be so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was astonished as i saw them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a present too , for he has been rude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did he speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then euryalus said ,  - king alcinous , i will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shall have my sword , which is of bronze , all but the hilt , which is of silver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into which it fits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it will be worth a great deal to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which ulysses answered ,  - good luck to you too my friend , and may the gods grant you every happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope you will not miss the sword you have given me along with your apology . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take their seats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> also , set a copper on the fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to the careful packing of the presents that the noble phaeacians have made him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that will follow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall myself give him this golden gobletwhich is of exquisite workmanshipthat he may be reminded of me for the rest of his life whenever he makes a drink offering to jove , or to any of the gods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from alcinous , and said to ulysses: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - see to the lid yourself , and have the whole bound round at once , for fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your ship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> [72]<s> <s> when ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast with a bond that circe had taught him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had done so before an upper servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was very glad of a warm bath , for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he left the house of calypso , who as long as he remained with her had taken as good care of him as though he had been a god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the servants had done washing and anointing him with oil , and had given him a clean cloak and shirt , he left the bath room and joined the guests who were sitting over their wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lovely nausicaa stood by one of the bearing - posts supporting the roof of the cloister , and admired him as she saw him pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - farewell stranger , said she ,  - do not forget me when you are safe at home again , for it is to me first that you owe a ransom for having saved your life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and ulysses said ,  - nausicaa , daughter of great alcinous , may jove the mighty husband of juno , grant that i may reach my home; so shall i bless you as my guardian angel all my days , for it was you who saved me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a servant led in the favourite bard demodocus , and set him in the midst of the company , near one of the bearing - posts supporting the cloister , that he might lean against it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of fat ( for there was abundance left on the joint ) and said to a servant ,  - take this piece of pork over to demodocus and tell him to eat it; for all the pain his lays may cause me i will salute him none the less; bards are honoured and respected throughout the world , for the muse teaches them their songs and loves them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servant carried the pork in his fingers over to demodocus , who took it and was very much pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they then laid their hands on the good things that were before them , and as soon as they had had to eat and drink , ulysses said to demodocus ,  - demodocus , there is no one in the world whom i admire more than i do you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must have studied under the muse , jove s daughter , and under apollo , so accurately do you sing the return of the achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you were not there yourself , you must have heard it all from some one who was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , however , change your song and tell us of the wooden horse which epeus made with the assistance of minerva , and which ulysses got by stratagem into the fort of troy after freighting it with the men who afterwards sacked the city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you will sing this tale aright i will tell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some of the argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others , hidden within the horse ,[73] were waiting with ulysses in the trojan place of assembly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their fortress , and it stood there while they sat in council round it , and were in three minds as to what they should do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some were for breaking it up then and there; others would have it dragged to the top of the rock on which the fortress stood , and then thrown down the precipice; while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation for the gods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and this was how they settled it in the end , for the city was doomed when it took in that horse , within which were all the bravest of the argives waiting to bring death and destruction on the trojans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sang how they overran the city hither and thither and ravaged it , and how ulysses went raging like mars along with menelaus to the house of deiphobus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was there that the fight raged most furiously , nevertheless by minerva s help he was victorious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wept as a woman weeps when she throws herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city and people , fighting bravely in defence of his home and children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for breath and dying , but her enemies beat her from behind about the back and shoulders , and carry her off into slavery , to a life of labour and sorrow , and the beauty fades from her cheekseven so piteously did ulysses weep , but none of those present perceived his tears except alcinous , who was sitting near him , and could hear the sobs and sighs that he was heaving . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king , therefore , at once rose and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - aldermen and town councillors of the phaeacians , let demodocus cease his song , for there are those present who do not seem to like it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the moment that we had done supper and demodocus began to sing , our guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is evidently in great trouble , so let the bard leave off , that we may all enjoy ourselves , hosts and guest alike . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this will be much more as it should be , for all these festivities , with the escort and the presents that we are making with so much good will are wholly in his honour , and any one with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - therefore , sir , do you on your part affect no more concealment nor reserve in the matter about which i shall ask you; it will be more polite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your father and mother over yonder used to call you , and by which you were known among your neighbours and fellow - citizens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as those of other nations have , but the ships themselves understand what it is that we are thinking about and want; they know all the cities and countries in the whole world , and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is covered with mist and cloud , so that there is no danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is what my father used to say , but whether the god will carry out his threat or no is a matter which he will decide for himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where have you been wandering , and in what countries have you travelled? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell us of the peoples themselves , and of their citieswho were hostile , savage and uncivilised , and who , on the other hand , hospitable and humane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell us also why you are made so unhappy on hearing about the return of the argive danaans from troy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gods arranged all this , and sent them their misfortunes in order that future generations might have something to sing about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or was it some brave and kindly - natured comradefor a good friend is as dear to a man as his own brother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses declares himself and begins his story - the cicons , lotophagi , and cyclopes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and ulysses answered ,  - king alcinous , it is a good thing to hear a bard with such a divine voice as this man has . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is nothing better or more delightful than when a whole people make merry together , with the guests sitting orderly to listen , while the table is loaded with bread and meats , and the cup - bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - firstly , then , i will tell you my name that you too may know it , and one day , if i outlive this time of sorrow , may become my guests though i live so far away from all of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , however , i will tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by jove s will i met with on my return from troy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when i had set sail thence the wind took me first to ismarus , which is the city of the cicons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there i sacked the town and put the people to the sword . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we took their wives and also much booty , which we divided equitably amongst us , so that none might have reason to complain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the cicons cried out for help to other cicons who lived inland . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts , but glad to have escaped death though we had lost our comrades , nor did we leave till we had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by the hands of the cicons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then jove raised the north wind against us till it blew a hurricane , so that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds , and night sprang forth out of the heavens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we let the ships run before the gale , but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters , so we took them down for fear of shipwreck , and rowed our hardest towards the land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there we lay two days and two nights suffering much alike from toil and distress of mind , but on the morning of the third day we again raised our masts , set sail , and took our places , letting the wind and steersmen direct our ship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should have got home at that time unharmed had not the north wind and the currents been against me as i was doubling cape malea , and set me off my course hard by the island of cythera . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had eaten and drunk i sent two of my company to see what manner of men the people of the place might be , and they had a third man under them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now the cyclopes neither plant nor plough , but trust in providence , and live on such wheat , barley , and grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage , and their wild grapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not quite close to the land of the cyclopes , but still not far . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is over - run with wild goats , that breed there in great numbers and are never disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmenwho as a rule will suffer so much hardship in forest or among mountain precipicesdo not go there , nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down , but it lies a wilderness untilled and unsown from year to year , and has no living thing upon it but only goats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the cyclopes have no ships , nor yet shipwrights who could make ships for them; they cannot therefore go from city to city , or sail over the sea to one another s country as people who have ships can do; if they had had these they would have colonised the island ,[78] for it is a very good one , and would yield everything in due season . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are meadows that in some places come right down to the sea shore , well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes would do there excellently; there is level land for ploughing , and it would always yield heavily at harvest time , for the soil is deep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a good harbour where no cables are wanted , nor yet anchors , nor need a ship be moored , but all one has to do is to beach one s vessel and stay there till the wind becomes fair for putting out to sea again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the head of the harbour there is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave , and there are poplars growing all round it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here we entered , but so dark was the night that some god must have brought us in , for there was nothing whatever to be seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn appeared , we admired the island and wandered all over it , while the nymphs jove s daughters roused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> heaven sent us excellent sport; i had twelve ships with me , and each ship got nine goats , while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill , and we had plenty of wine left , for each one of us had taken many jars full when we sacked the city of the cicons , and this had not yet run out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while we were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the cyclopes , which was hard by , and saw the smoke of their stubble fires . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their sheep and goats , but when the sun went down and it came on dark , we camped down upon the beach , and next morning i called a council . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stay here , my brave fellows ,  said i , all the rest of you , while i go with my ship and exploit these people myself: i want to see if they are uncivilised savages , or a hospitable and humane race . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we got to the land , which was not far , there , on the face of a cliff near the sea , we saw a great cave overhung with laurels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a station for a great many sheep and goats , and outside there was a large yard , with a high wall round it made of stones built into the ground and of trees both pine and oak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was the abode of a huge monster who was then away from home shepherding his flocks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i told my men to draw the ship ashore , and stay where they were , all but the twelve best among them , who were to go along with myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by maron , son of euanthes , who was priest of apollo the patron god of ismarus , and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we were sacking the city we respected him , and spared his life , as also his wife and child; so he made me some presents of great valueseven talents of fine gold , and a bowl of silver , with twelve jars of sweet wine , unblended , and of the most exquisite flavour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not a man nor maid in the house knew about it , but only himself , his wife , and one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine , and yet the fragrance from the mixing - bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain from drinking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i filled a large skin with this wine , and took a wallet full of provisions with me , for my mind misgave me that i might have to deal with some savage who would be of great strength , and would respect neither right nor law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we soon reached his cave , but he was out shepherding , so we went inside and took stock of all that we could see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his cheese - racks were loaded with cheeses , and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could hold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets , then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones[80] all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy , all the vessels , bowls , and milk pails into which he milked , were swimming with whey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they saw all this , my men begged me to let them first steal some cheeses , and make off with them to the ship; they would then return , drive down the lambs and kids , put them on board and sail away with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would have been indeed better if we had done so but i would not listen to them , for i wanted to see the owner himself , in the hope that he might give me a present . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when , however , we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we lit a fire , offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice , ate others of them , and then sat waiting till the cyclops should come in with his sheep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he came , he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood to light the fire for his supper , and this he flung with such a noise on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far end of the cavern . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside , as well as the she - goats that he was going to milk , leaving the males , both rams and he - goats , outside in the yards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he rolled a huge stone to the mouth of the caveso huge that two and twenty strong four - wheeled waggons would not be enough to draw it from its place against the doorway . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats , all in due course , and then let each of them have her own young . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had got through with all his work , he lit the fire , and then caught sight of us , whereon he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where do sail from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you traders , or do you sail the sea as rovers , with your hands against every man , and every man s hand against you?  <s> <s>  - we were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous form , but i managed to say , we are achaeans on our way home from troy , but by the will of jove , and stress of weather , we have been driven far out of our course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> may your excellency fear the wrath of heaven , for we are your suppliants , and jove takes all respectable travellers under his protection , for he is the avenger of all suppliants and foreigners in distress . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - to this he gave me but a pitiless answer , stranger ,  said he , you are a fool , or else you know nothing of this country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we cyclopes do not care about jove or any of your blessed gods , for we are ever so much stronger than they . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall not spare either yourself or your companions out of any regard for jove , unless i am in the humour for doing so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came on shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it round the point , or is she lying straight off the land?  <s> <s>  - he said this to draw me out , but i was too cunning to be caught in that way , so i answered with a lie; neptune ,  said i , sent my ship on to the rocks at the far end of your country , and wrecked it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we were driven on to them from the open sea , but i and those who are with me escaped the jaws of death . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer , but with a sudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down upon the ground as though they had been puppies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their brains were shed upon the ground , and the earth was wet with their blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he tore them limb from limb and supped upon them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he gobbled them up like a lion in the wilderness , flesh , bones , marrow , and entrails , without leaving anything uneaten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was at first inclined to seize my sword , draw it , and drive it into his vitals , but i reflected that if i did we should all certainly be lost , for we should never be able to shift the stone which the monster had put in front of the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn , appeared , he again lit his fire , milked his goats and ewes , all quite rightly , and then let each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his work , he clutched up two more of my men , and began eating them for his morning s meal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently , with the utmost ease , he rolled the stone away from the door and drove out his sheep , but he at once put it back againas easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a quiver full of arrows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as he had done so he shouted , and cried shoo , shoo ,  after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain; so i was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself with glory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the end i deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows: the cyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; it was of green olive wood , and he had cut it intending to use it for a staff as soon as it should be dry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was so huge that we could only compare it to the mast of a twenty - oared merchant vessel of large burden , and able to venture out into open sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i went up to this club and cut off about six feet of it; i then gave this piece to the men and told them to fine it evenly off at one end , which they proceeded to do , and lastly i brought it to a point myself , charring the end in the fire to make it harder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i had done this i hid it under dung , which was lying about all over the cave , and told the men to cast lots which of them should venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the monster s eye while he was asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lot fell upon the very four whom i should have chosen , and i myself made five . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the evening the wretch came back from shepherding , and drove his flocks into the cavethis time driving them all inside , and not leaving any in the yards; i suppose some fancy must have taken him , or a god must have prompted him to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as he had put the stone back to its place against the door , he sat down , milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly , and then let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all this work , he gripped up two more of my men , and made his supper off them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so i went up to him with an ivy - wood bowl of black wine in my hands: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look here , cyclops ,  said i , you have been eating a great deal of man s flesh , so take this and drink some wine , that you may see what kind of liquor we had on board my ship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was so delighted with the taste of the wine that he begged me for another bowl full . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be so kind ,  he said , as to give me some more , and tell me your name at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i want to make you a present that you will be glad to have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have wine even in this country , for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them , but this drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i then gave him some more; three times did i fill the bowl for him , and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then , when i saw that the wine had got into his head , i said to him as plausibly as i could: cyclops , you ask my name and i will tell it you; give me , therefore , the present you promised me; my name is noman; this is what my father and mother and my friends have always called me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - but the cruel wretch said , then i will eat all noman s comrades before noman himself , and will keep noman for the last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is the present that i will make him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently he turned sick , and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human flesh on which he had been gorging , for he was very drunk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then i thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it , and encouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint - hearted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the wood , green though it was , was about to blaze , i drew it out of the fire glowing with heat , and my men gathered round me , for heaven had filled their hearts with courage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we drove the sharp end of the beam into the monster s eye , and bearing upon it with all my weight i kept turning it round and round as though i were boring a hole in a ship s plank with an auger , which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye , till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked it round and round , so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows , and the roots of the eye sputtered in the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to temper itfor it is this that gives strength to the ironand it makes a great hiss as he does so , even thus did the cyclops  eye hiss round the beam of olive wood , and his hideous yells made the cave ring again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we ran away in a fright , but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye , and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain , shouting as he did so to the other cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying , and asked what was the matter with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> surely no man is carrying off your sheep? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> surely no man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?  <s> <s>  - but polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave , noman is killing me by fraud; no man is killing me by force . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - then ,  said they , if no man is attacking you , you must be ill; when jove makes people ill , there is no help for it , and you had better pray to your father neptune . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - then they went away , and i laughed inwardly at the success of my clever stratagem , but the cyclops , groaning and in an agony of pain , felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch anyone going out with the sheep , for he thought i might be foolish enough to attempt this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the end i deemed that this plan would be the best; the male sheep were well grown , and carried a heavy black fleece , so i bound them noiselessly in threes together , with some of the withies on which the wicked monster used to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was to be a man under the middle sheep , and the two on either side were to cover him , so that there were three sheep to each man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for myself there was a ram finer than any of the others , so i caught hold of him by the back , esconced myself in the thick wool under his belly , and hung on patiently to his fleece , face upwards , keeping a firm hold on it all the time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thus , then , did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came , but when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn , appeared , the male sheep hurried out to feed , while the ewes remained bleating about the pens waiting to be milked , for their udders were full to bursting; but their master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they stood upright , without being sharp enough to find out that the men were underneath their bellies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the ram was going out , last of all , heavy with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self , polyphemus laid hold of it and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my good ram , what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this morning? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it because you know your master has lost his eye , and are sorry because that wicked noman and his horrid crew has got him down in his drink and blinded him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i will have his life yet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no - good noman has done me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - as he spoke he drove the ram outside , but when we were a little way out from the cave and yards , i first got from under the ram s belly , and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep , which were very fat , by constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them down to the ship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who had escaped death , but wept for the others whom the cyclops had killed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , i made signs to them by nodding and frowning that they were to hush their crying , and told them to get all the sheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard , took their places , and smote the grey sea with their oars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - cyclops ,  said i , you should have taken better measure of your man before eating up his comrades in your cave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you wretch , eat up your visitors in your own house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you might have known that your sin would find you out , and now jove and the other gods have punished you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - he got more and more furious as he heard me , so he tore the top from off a high mountain , and flung it just in front of my ship so that it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[81] the sea quaked as the rock fell into it , and the wash of the wave it raised carried us back towards the mainland , and forced us towards the shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off , making signs to my men by nodding my head , that they must row for their lives , whereon they laid out with a will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we had got twice as far as we were before , i was for jeering at the cyclops again , but the men begged and prayed of me to hold my tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not ,  they exclaimed , be mad enough to provoke this savage creature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back again to the mainland , and we made sure it had been the death of us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have pounded our heads and our ship s timbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks he would have heaved at us , for he can throw them a long way . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - on this he groaned , and cried out , alas , alas , then the old prophecy about me is coming true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a prophet here , at one time , a man both brave and of great stature , telemus son of eurymus , who was an excellent seer , and did all the prophesying for the cyclopes till he grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day , and said i should lose my sight by the hand of ulysses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he , if he so will , shall heal me , which no one else neither god nor man can do . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - then i said , i wish i could be as sure of killing you outright and sending you down to the house of hades , as i am that it will take more than neptune to cure that eye of yours . </s> </s> 
 [82]<s> <s>  - thus did he pray , and neptune heard his prayer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he picked up a rock much larger than the first , swung it aloft and hurled it with prodigious force . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it fell just short of the ship , but was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our ships , we found our comrades lamenting us , and anxiously awaiting our return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the sea shore; we also landed the cyclops  sheep , and divided them equitably amongst us so that none might have reason to complain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the ram , my companions agreed that i should have it as an extra share; so i sacrificed it on the sea shore , and burned its thigh bones to jove , who is the lord of all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he heeded not my sacrifice , and only thought how he might destroy both my ships and my comrades . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and drink , but when the sun went down and it came on dark , we camped upon the beach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the child of morning rosy - fingered dawn appeared , i bade my men on board and loose the hawsers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thence we went on to the aeolian island where lives aeolus son of hippotas , dear to the immortal gods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is an island that floats ( as it were ) upon the sea ,[83] iron bound with a wall that girds it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , aeolus has six daughters and six lusty sons , so he made the sons marry the daughters , and they all live with their dear father and mother , feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all day long the atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats till it groans again , yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well made bedsteads , each with his own wife between the blankets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these were the people among whom we had now come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the time about troy , the argive fleet , and the return of the achaeans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the west wind which was fair for us did he alone let blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing , for we were lost through our own folly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we got so close in that we could see the stubble fires burning , and i , being then dead beat , fell into a light sleep , for i had never let the rudder out of my own hands , that we might get home the faster . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this the men fell to talking among themselves , and said i was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that aeolus had given me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bless my heart ,  would one turn to his neighbour , saying , how this man gets honoured and makes friends to whatever city or country he may go . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they loosed the sack , whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried us weeping out to sea and away from our own country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then i awoke , and knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make the best of it; but i bore it , covered myself up , and lay down in the ship , while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet back to the aeolian island . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> immediately after dinner i took a herald and one of my men and went straight to the house of aeolus , where i found him feasting with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the threshold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were astounded when they saw us and said , ulysses , what brings you here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what god has been ill - treating you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we took great pains to further you on your way home to ithaca , or wherever it was that you wanted to go to . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - thus did they speak , but i answered sorrowfully , my men have undone me; they , and cruel sleep , have ruined me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i spoke as movingly as i could , but they said nothing , till their father answered , vilest of mankind , get you gone at once out of the island; him whom heaven hates will i in no wise help . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be off , for you come here as one abhorred of heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and with these words he sent me sorrowing from his door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> six days , night and day did we toil , and on the seventh day we reached the rocky stronghold of lamustelepylus , the city of the laestrygonians , where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked] salutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last answers the salute . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in that country a man who could do without sleep might earn double wages , one as a herdsman of cattle , and another as a shepherd , for they work much the same by night as they do by day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so i sent two of my company with an attendant to find out what sort of people the inhabitants were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the people draw their firewood from the mountains into the town , till presently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water , and who was daughter to a laestrygonian named antiphates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was going to the fountain artacia from which the people bring in their water , and when my men had come close up to her , they asked her who the king of that country might be , and over what kind of people he ruled; so she directed them to her father s house , but when they got there they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain , and they were horrified at the sight of her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she at once called her husband antiphates from the place of assembly , and forthwith he set about killing my men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he snatched up one of them , and began to make his dinner off him then and there , whereon the other two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but antiphates raised a hue - and - cry after them , and thousands of sturdy laestrygonians sprang up from every quarterogres , not men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they threw vast rocks at us from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones , and i heard the horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another , and the death cries of my men , as the laestrygonians speared them like fishes and took them home to eat them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while they were thus killing my men within the harbour i drew my sword , cut the cable of my own ship , and told my men to row with all their might if they too would not fare like the rest; so they laid out for their lives , and we were thankful enough when we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the others there was not one of them left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thence we sailed sadly on , glad to have escaped death , though we had lost our comrades , and came to the aeaean island , where circe livesa great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician aeetesfor they are both children of the sun by perse , who is daughter to oceanus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word , for some god guided us thither , and having landed we lay there for two days and two nights , worn out in body and mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the morning of the third day came i took my spear and my sword , and went away from the ship to reconnoitre , and see if i could discover signs of human handiwork , or hear the sound of voices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> climbing to the top of a high look - out i espied the smoke of circe s house rising upwards amid a dense forest of trees , and when i saw this i doubted whether , having seen the smoke , i would not go on at once and find out more , but in the end i deemed it best to go back to the ship , give the men their dinners , and send some of them instead of going myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as i threw him down in front of the ship , i called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look here my friends ,  said i , we are not going to die so much before our time after all , and at any rate we will not starve so long as we have got something to eat and drink on board . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed there eating and drinking our fill , but when the sun went down and it came on dark , we camped upon the sea shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn , appeared , i called a council and said , my friends , we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i see no way out of it; nevertheless , we must try and find one . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - their hearts sank as they heard me , for they remembered how they had been treated by the laestrygonian antiphates , and by the savage ogre polyphemus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they wept bitterly in their dismay , but there was nothing to be got by crying , so i divided them into two companies and set a captain over each; i gave one company to eurylochus , while i took command of the other myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then we cast lots in a helmet , and the lot fell upon eurylochus; so he set out with his twenty - two men , and they wept , as also did we who were left behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did not attack my men , but wagged their great tails , fawned upon them , and rubbed their noses lovingly against them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently they reached the gates of the goddess s house , and as they stood there they could hear circe within , singing most beautifully as she worked at her loom , making a web so fine , so soft , and of such dazzling colours as no one but a goddess could weave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this polites , whom i valued and trusted more than any other of my men , said , there is some one inside working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the whole place resounds with it , let us call her and see whether she is woman or goddess . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - they called her and she came down , unfastened the door , and bade them enter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they , thinking no evil , followed her , all except eurylochus , who suspected mischief and staid outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thus then were they shut up squealing , and circe threw them some acorns and beech masts such as pigs eat , but eurylochus hurried back to tell me about the sad fate of our comrades . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we went ,  said he , as you told us , through the forest , and in the middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place that could be seen from far . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there we found a woman , or else she was a goddess , working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to her and called her , whereon she at once came down , opened the door , and invited us in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from that moment i saw them no more , for not one of them ever came out , though i sat a long time watching for them . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - stay where you are , then ,  answered i , eating and drinking at the ship , but i must go , for i am most urgently bound to do so . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - with this i left the ship and went up inland . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i got through the charmed grove , and was near the great house of the enchantress circe , i met mercury with his golden wand , disguised as a young man in the hey - day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he came up to me and took my hand within his own , saying , my poor unhappy man , whither are you going over this mountain top , alone and without knowing the way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your men are shut up in circe s pigstyes , like so many wild boars in their lairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you surely do not fancy that you can set them free? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can tell you that you will never get back and will have to stay there with the rest of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take this herb , which is one of great virtue , and keep it about you when you go to circe s house , it will be a talisman to you against every kind of mischief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that circe will try to practice upon you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she will mix a mess for you to drink , and she will drug the meal with which she makes it , but she will not be able to charm you , for the virtue of the herb that i shall give you will prevent her spells from working . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will tell you all about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when circe strikes you with her wand , draw your sword and spring upon her as though you were going to kill her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she will then be frightened , and will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must not point blank refuse her , for you want her to set your companions free , and to take good care also of yourself , but you must make her swear solemnly by all the blessed gods that she will plot no further mischief against you , or else when she has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the root was black , while the flower was as white as milk; the gods call it moly , and mortal men cannot uproot it , but the gods can do whatever they like . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then mercury went back to high olympus passing over the wooded island; but i fared onward to the house of circe , and my heart was clouded with care as i walked along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i got to the gates i stood there and called the goddess , and as soon as she heard me she came down , opened the door , and asked me to come in; so i followed hermuch troubled in my mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver , there was a footstool also under my feet , and she mixed a mess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it , for she meant me mischief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there now ,  she cried , be off to the pigstye , and make your lair with the rest of them . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - but i rushed at her with my sword drawn as though i would kill her , whereon she fell with a loud scream , clasped my knees , and spoke piteously , saying , who and whence are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you? </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - and i answered , circe , how can you expect me to be friendly with you when you have just been turning all my men into pigs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now that you have got me here myself , you mean me mischief when you ask me to go to bed with you , and will unman me and make me fit for nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are the children of the groves and fountains , and of the holy waters that run down into the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of them spread a fair purple cloth over a seat , and laid a carpet underneath it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another brought tables of silver up to the seats , and set them with baskets of gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the water in the cauldron was boiling ,[87] she poured cold into it till it was just as i liked it , and then she set me in a bath and began washing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders , to take the tire and stiffness out of my limbs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as she had done washing me and anointing me with oil , she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under my feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a maid servant then brought me water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash my hands , and she drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant brought me bread and offered me many things of what there was in the house , and then circe bade me eat , but i would not , and sat without heeding what was before me , still moody and suspicious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when circe saw me sitting there without eating , and in great grief , she came to me and said , ulysses , why do you sit like that as though you were dumb , gnawing at your own heart , and refusing both meat and drink? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it that you are still suspicious? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you ought not to be , for i have already sworn solemnly that i will not hurt you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you want me to eat and drink , you must free my men and bring them to me that i may see them with my own eyes . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - when i had said this she went straight through the court with her wand in her hand and opened the pigstye doors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my men came out like so many prime hogs and stood looking at her , but she went about among them and anointed each with a second drug , whereon the bristles that the bad drug had given them fell off , and they became men again , younger than they were before , and much taller and better looking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they knew me at once , seized me each of them by the hand , and wept for joy till the whole house was filled with the sound of their halloa - ballooing , and circe herself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and said , ulysses , noble son of laertes , go back at once to the sea where you have left your ship , and first draw it on to the land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , hide all your ship s gear and property in some cave , and come back here with your men . </s> </s>

<s> <s> they seemed as glad to see me as though they had got back to their own rugged ithaca , where they had been born and bred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sir ,  said the affectionate creatures , we are as glad to see you back as though we had got safe home to ithaca; but tell us all about the fate of our comrades . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i spoke comfortingly to them and said , we must draw our ship on to the land , and hide the ship s gear with all our property in some cave; then come with me all of you as fast as you can to circe s house , where you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great abundance . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - on this the men would have come with me at once , but eurylochus tried to hold them back and said , alas , poor wretches that we are , what will become of us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rush not on your ruin by going to the house of circe , who will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions , and we shall have to keep guard over her house . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was all through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - when i heard him i was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of his being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him and said , sir , if it may so be , let this fellow stay here and mind the ship , but take the rest of us with you to circe s house . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - on this we all went inland , and eurylochus was not left behind after all , but came on too , for he was frightened by the severe reprimand that i had given him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - meanwhile circe had been seeing that the men who had been left behind were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given them woollen cloaks and shirts , and when we came we found them all comfortably at dinner in her house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as the men saw each other face to face and knew one another , they wept for joy and cried aloud till the whole palace rang again . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - thus did she speak and we assented . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we stayed with circe for a whole twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i , however , after i had got into bed with circe , besought her by her knees , and the goddess listened to what i had got to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> circe ,  said i , please to keep the promise you made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i want to get back and so do my men , they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon as ever your back is turned . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - and the goddess answered , ulysses , noble son of laertes , you shall none of you stay here any longer if you do not want to , but there is another journey which you have got to take before you can sail homewards . </s> </s>

<s> <s> to him alone has proserpine left his understanding even in death , but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i sat up in bed and wept , and would gladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun , but presently when i was tired of weeping and tossing myself about , i said , and who shall guide me upon this voyagefor the house of hades is a port that no ship can reach . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - you will want no guide ,  she answered; raise your mast , set your white sails , sit quite still , and the north wind will blow you there of itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when your ship has traversed the waters of oceanus , you will reach the fertile shore of proserpine s country with its groves of tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your ship upon the shore of oceanus , and go straight on to the dark abode of hades . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will find it near the place where the rivers pyriphlegethon and cocytus ( which is a branch of the river styx ) flow into acheron , and you will see a rock near it , just where the two roaring rivers run into one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when you have reached this spot , as i now tell you , dig a trench a cubit or so in length , breadth , and depth , and pour into it as a drink - offering to all the dead , first , honey mixed with milk , then wine , and in the third place watersprinkling white barley meal over the whole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble ghosts , and promise them that when you get back to ithaca you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them , the best you have , and will load the pyre with good things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> more particularly you must promise that teiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself , the finest in all your flocks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers , offer them a ram and a black ewe , bending their heads towards erebus; but yourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the river . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this , many dead men s ghosts will come to you , and you must tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have just killed , and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to hades and to proserpine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then draw your sword and sit there , so as to prevent any other poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before teiresias shall have answered your questions . </s> </s>

 [91]<s> <s>  - this ,  i answered , must be as it may please heaven , but tell me and tell me and tell me true , i see my poor mother s ghost close by us; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word , and though i am her own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me , sir , how i can make her know me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - that ,  said he , i can soon do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she knew me at once and spoke fondly to me , saying , my son , how did you come down to this abode of darkness while you are still alive? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a hard thing for the living to see these places , for between us and them there are great and terrible waters , and there is oceanus , which no man can cross on foot , but he must have a good ship to take him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you have a long illness , or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy passage to eternity? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me also about my father , and the son whom i left behind me , is my property still in their hands , or has some one else got hold of it , who thinks that i shall not return to claim it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one as yet has got possession of your fine property , and telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed . </s> </s>

 [93]<s> <s>  - then i tried to find some way of embracing my poor mother s ghost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thrice i sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms , but each time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom , and being touched to the quick i said to her , mother , why do you not stay still when i would embrace you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if we could throw our arms around one another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in the house of hades; does proserpine want to lay a still further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?  <s> <s>  - my son ,  she answered , most ill - fated of all mankind , it is not proserpine that is beguiling you , but all people are like this when they are dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , however , go back to the light of day as soon as you can , and note all these things that you may tell them to your wife hereafter . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - thus did we converse , and anon proserpine sent up the ghosts of the wives and daughters of all the most famous men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they gathered in crowds about the blood , and i considered how i might question them severally . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the end i deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh , and keep them from all drinking the blood at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so they came up one after the other , and each one as i questioned her told me her race and lineage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[94] she fell in love with the river enipeus who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once when she was taking a walk by his side as usual , neptune , disguised as her lover , lay with her at the mouth of the river , and a huge blue wave arched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god , whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take great care of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am neptune , so now go home , but hold your tongue and do not tell any one . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - then he dived under the sea , and she in due course bore pelias and neleus , who both of them served jove with all their might . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pelias was a great breeder of sheep and lived in iolcus , but the other lived in pylos . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rest of her children were by cretheus , namely , aeson , pheres , and amythaon , who was a mighty warrior and charioteer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - next to her i saw antiope , daughter to asopus , who could boast of having slept in the arms of even jove himself , and who bore him two sons amphion and zethus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these founded thebes with its seven gates , and built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they could not hold thebes till they had walled it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i saw alcmena , the wife of amphitryon , who also bore to jove indomitable hercules; and megara who was daughter to great king creon , and married the redoubtable son of amphitryon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i also saw fair epicaste mother of king oedipodes whose awful lot it was to marry her own son without suspecting it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he married her after having killed his father , but the gods proclaimed the whole story to the world; whereon he remained king of thebes , in great grief for the spite the gods had borne him; but epicaste went to the house of the mighty jailor hades , having hanged herself for grief , and the avenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged motherto his ruing bitterly thereafter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i saw chloris , whom neleus married for her beauty , having given priceless presents for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was youngest daughter to amphion son of iasus and king of minyan orchomenus , and was queen in pylos . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she bore nestor , chromius , and periclymenus , and she also bore that marvellously lovely woman pero , who was wooed by all the country round; but neleus would only give her to him who should raid the cattle of iphicles from the grazing grounds of phylace , and this was a hard task . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , then , was the will of jove accomplished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i saw leda the wife of tyndarus , who bore him two famous sons , castor breaker of horses , and pollux the mighty boxer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - after her i saw iphimedeia wife of aloeus who boasted the embrace of neptune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she bore two sons otus and ephialtes , but both were short lived . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and ulysses answered ,  - king alcinous , if you were to bid me to stay here for a whole twelve months , and then speed me on my way , loaded with your noble gifts , i should obey you gladly and it would redound greatly to my advantage , for i should return fuller - handed to my own people , and should thus be more respected and beloved by all who see me when i get back to ithaca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ulysses , replied alcinous ,  - not one of us who sees you has any idea that you are a charlatan or a swindler . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know there are many people going about who tell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see through them , but there is a style about your language which assures me of your good disposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover you have told the story of your own misfortunes , and those of the argives , as though you were a practiced bard; but tell me , and tell me true , whether you saw any of the mighty heroes who went to troy at the same time with yourself , and perished there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the evenings are still at their longest , and it is not yet bed timego on , therefore , with your divine story , for i could stay here listening till tomorrow morning , so long as you will continue to tell us of your adventures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions , the ghost of agamemnon son of atreus came sadly up to me , surrounded by those who had perished with him in the house of aegisthus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how did you come by your death ,  said i , king agamemnon? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did neptune raise his winds and waves against you when you were at sea , or did your enemies make an end of you on the main land when you were cattle - lifting or sheep - stealing , or while they were fighting in defence of their wives and city?  <s> <s>  - ulysses ,  he answered , noble son of laertes , i was not lost at sea in any storm of neptune s raising , nor did my foes despatch me upon the mainland , but aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engagement , or in single combat , but you never saw anything so truly pitiable as the way in which we fell in that cloister , with the mixing bowl and the loaded tables lying all about , and the ground reeking with our blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i heard priam s daughter cassandra scream as clytemnestra killed her close beside me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body , and raised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess , but she slipped away from me; she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when i was dying , for there is nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as hers was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fancy murdering her own husband! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought i was going to be welcomed home by my children and my servants , but her abominable crime has brought disgrace on herself and all women who shall come aftereven on the good ones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see how many of us fell for helen s sake , and now it seems that clytemnestra hatched mischief against you too during your absence . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - be sure , therefore ,  continued agamemnon , and not be too friendly even with your own wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not tell her all that you know perfectly well yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell her a part only , and keep your own counsel about the rest . </s> </s>

 <s> <s>  - and i said , agamemnon , why do you ask me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not know whether your son is alive or dead , and it is not right to talk when one does not know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fleet descendant of aeacus knew me and spoke piteously , saying , ulysses , noble son of laertes , what deed of daring will you undertake next , that you venture down to the house of hades among us silly dead , who are but the ghosts of them that can labour no more?  <s> <s>  - and i said , achilles , son of peleus , foremost champion of the achaeans , i came to consult teiresias , and see if he could advise me about my return home to ithaca , for i have never yet been able to get near the achaean land , nor to set foot in my own country , but have been in trouble all the time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for you , achilles , no one was ever yet so fortunate as you have been , nor ever will be , for you were adored by all us argives as long as you were alive , and now that you are here you are a great prince among the dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not , therefore , take it so much to heart even if you are dead . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - say not a word ,  he answered , in death s favour; i would rather be a paid servant in a poor man s house and be above ground than king of kings among the dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but give me news about my son; is he gone to the wars and will he be a great soldier , or is this not so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me also if you have heard anything about my father peleusdoes he still rule among the myrmidons , or do they show him no respect throughout hellas and phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> could i but stand by his side , in the light of day , with the same strength that i had when i killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of troycould i but be as i then was and go even for a short time to my father s house , any one who tried to do him violence or supersede him would soon rue it . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i have heard nothing ,  i answered , of peleus , but i can tell you all about your son neoptolemus , for i took him in my own ship from scyros with the achaeans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in our councils of war before troy he was always first to speak , and his judgement was unerring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nestor and i were the only two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting on the plain of troy , he would never remain with the body of his men , but would dash on far in front , foremost of them all in valour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many a man did he kill in battlei cannot name every single one of those whom he slew while fighting on the side of the argives , but will only say how he killed that valiant hero eurypylus son of telephus , who was the handsomest man i ever saw except memnon; many others also of the ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman s bribes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , when all the bravest of the argives went inside the horse that epeus had made , and it was left to me to settle when we should either open the door of our ambuscade , or close it , though all the other leaders and chief men among the danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every limb , i never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he was all the time urging me to break out from the horsegrasping the handle of his sword and his bronze - shod spear , and breathing fury against the foe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet when we had sacked the city of priam he got his handsome share of the prize money and went on board ( such is the fortune of war ) without a wound upon him , neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat , for the rage of mars is a matter of great chance . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - when i had told him this , the ghost of achilles strode off across a meadow full of asphodel , exulting over what i had said concerning the prowess of his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thetis had offered it as a prize , but the trojan prisoners and minerva were the judges . </s> </s>

 <s> <s>  - he would not answer , but turned away to erebus and to the other ghosts; nevertheless , i should have made him talk to me in spite of his being so angry , or i should have gone on talking to him ,[97] only that there were still others among the dead whom i desired to see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i saw minos son of jove with his golden sceptre in his hand sitting in judgement on the dead , and the ghosts were gathered sitting and standing round him in the spacious house of hades , to learn his sentences upon them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - after him i saw huge orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the ghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains , and he had a great bronze club in his hand , unbreakable for ever and ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i saw tityus son of gaia stretched upon the plain and covering some nine acres of ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two vultures on either side of him were digging their beaks into his liver , and he kept on trying to beat them off with his hands , but could not; for he had violated jove s mistress leto as she was going through panopeus on her way to pytho . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i saw also the dreadful fate of tantalus , who stood in a lake that reached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst , but could never reach the water , for whenever the poor creature stooped to drink , it dried up and vanished , so that there was nothing but dry groundparched by the spite of heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i saw sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone with both his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - after him i saw mighty hercules , but it was his phantom only , for he is feasting ever with the immortal gods , and has lovely hebe to wife , who is daughter of jove and juno . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and i should have seen still other of them that are gone before , whom i would fain have seentheseus and pirithousglorious children of the gods , but so many thousands of ghosts came round me and uttered such appalling cries , that i was panic stricken lest proserpine should send up from the house of hades the head of that awful monster gorgon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this i hastened back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board at once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places , whereon the ship went down the stream of the river oceanus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sirens , scylla and charybdis , the cattle of the sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - after we were clear of the river oceanus , and had got out into the open sea , we went on till we reached the aeaean island where there is dawn and sun - rise as in other places . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we then drew our ship on to the sands and got out of her on to the shore , where we went to sleep and waited till day should break . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn , appeared , i sent some men to circe s house to fetch the body of elpenor . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when his body and armour had been burned to ashes , we raised a cairn , set a stone over it , and at the top of the cairn we fixed the oar that he had been used to row with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she stood in the midst of us and said , you have done a bold thing in going down alive to the house of hades , and you will have died twice , to other people s once; now , then , stay here for the rest of the day , feast your fill , and go on with your voyage at daybreak tomorrow morning . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - we agreed to do as she had said , and feasted through the livelong day to the going down of the sun , but when the sun had set and it came on dark , the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated away from the others , while she reclined by my side and asked me all about our adventures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first you will come to the sirens who enchant all who come near them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if any one unwarily draws in too close and hears the singing of the sirens , his wife and children will never welcome him home again , for they sit in a green field and warble him to death with the sweetness of their song . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore pass these sirens by , and stop your men s ears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen yourself , for you may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross piece half way up the mast ,[99] and they must lash the rope s ends to the mast itself , that you may have the pleasure of listening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when your crew have taken you past these sirens , i cannot give you coherent directions[100] as to which of two courses you are to take; i will lay the two alternatives before you , and you must consider them for yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against which the deep blue waves of amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the blessed gods call these rocks the wanderers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here not even a bird may pass , no , not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to father jove , but the sheer rock always carries off one of them , and father jove has to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to these rocks has got away again , but the waves and whirlwinds of fire are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the only vessel that ever sailed and got through , was the famous argo on her way from the house of aetes , and she too would have gone against these great rocks , only that juno piloted her past them for the love she bore to jason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a dark cloud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the middle of it there is a large cavern , looking west and turned towards erebus; you must take your ship this way , but the cave is so high up that not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inside it scylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to be that of a young hound , but in truth she is a dreadful monster and no onenot even a godcould face her without being terror - struck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no ship ever yet got past her without losing some men , for she shoots out all her heads at once , and carries off a man in each mouth . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - is there no way ,  said i , of escaping charybdis , and at the same time keeping scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?  <s> <s>  - you dare devil ,  replied the goddess , you are always wanting to fight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even by the immortals . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - you will now come to the thrinacian island , and here you will see many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun - godseven herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep , with fifty head in each flock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they do not breed , nor do they become fewer in number , and they are tended by the goddesses phaethusa and lampetie , who are children of the sun - god hyperion by neaera . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you leave these flocks unharmed , and think of nothing but getting home , you may yet after much hardship reach ithaca; but if you harm them , then i forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and of your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape , you will return late , in bad plight , after losing all your men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i then went on board and told my men to loose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her , took their places , and began to smite the grey sea with their oars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently the great and cunning goddess circe befriended us with a fair wind that blew dead aft , and staid steadily with us , keeping our sails well filled , so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship s gear , and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , being much troubled in mind , i said to my men , my friends , it is not right that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies that circe has made me , i will therefore tell you about them , so that whether we live or die we may do so with our eyes open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first she said we were to keep clear of the sirens , who sit and sing most beautifully in a field of flowers; but she said i might hear them myself so long as no one else did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore , take me and bind me to the crosspiece half way up the mast; bind me as i stand upright , with a bond so fast that i cannot possibly break away , and lash the rope s ends to the mast itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of wind nor a ripple upon the water , so the men furled the sails and stowed them; then taking to their oars they whitened the water with the foam they raised in rowing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile i look a large wheel of wax and cut it up small with my sword . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then i kneaded the wax in my strong hands till it became soft , which it soon did between the kneading and the rays of the sun - god son of hyperion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then i stopped the ears of all my men , and they bound me hands and feet to the mast as i stood upright on the cross piece; but they went on rowing themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we had got within earshot of the land , and the ship was going at a good rate , the sirens saw that we were getting in shore and began with their singing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one ever sailed past us without staying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our songand he who listens will go on his way not only charmed , but wiser , for we know all the ills that the gods laid upon the argives and trojans before troy , and can tell you everything that is going to happen over the whole world . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - they sang these words most musically , and as i longed to hear them further i made signs by frowning to my men that they should set me free; but they quickened their stroke , and eurylochus and perimedes bound me with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of the sirens  voices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then my men took the wax from their ears and unbound me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - immediately after we had got past the island i saw a great wave from which spray was rising , and i heard a loud roaring sound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the men were so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars , for the whole sea resounded with the rushing of the waters ,[103] but the ship stayed where it was , for the men had left off rowing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i went round , therefore , and exhorted them man by man not to lose heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friends ,  said i , this is not the first time that we have been in danger , and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the cyclops shut us up in his cave; nevertheless , my courage and wise counsel saved us then , and we shall live to look back on all this as well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for you , coxswain , these are your orders; attend to them , for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from these steaming rapids and hug the rock , or she will give you the slip and be over yonder before you know where you are , and you will be the death of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in one thing only did i disobey circe s strict instructionsi put on my armour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she began to suck again , we could see the water all inside whirling round and round , and it made a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we could see the bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud , and the men were at their wits ends for fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while we were taken up with this , and were expecting each moment to be our last , scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and snatched up my six best men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as a fisherman , seated , spear in hand , upon some jutting rock[104] throws bait into the water to deceive the poor little fishes , and spears them with the ox s horn with which his spear is shod , throwing them gasping on to the land as he catches them one by oneeven so did scylla land these panting creatures on her rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den , while they screamed and stretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was the most sickening sight that i saw throughout all my voyages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when we had passed the [wandering] rocks , with scylla and terrible charybdis , we reached the noble island of the sun - god , where were the goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun hyperion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while still at sea in my ship i could bear the cattle lowing as they came home to the yards , and the sheep bleating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then i remembered what the blind theban prophet teiresias had told me , and how carefully aeaean circe had warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun - god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> head the ship , therefore , away from the island . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the men were in despair at this , and eurylochus at once gave me an insolent answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , therefore , let us obey the behests of night and prepare our supper here hard by the ship; to - morrow morning we will go on board again and put out to sea . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - thus spoke eurylochus , and the men approved his words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw that heaven meant us a mischief and said , you force me to yield , for you are many against one , but at any rate each one of you must take his solemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep , he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either , but will be satisfied with the food that circe has given us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink , they began talking about their poor comrades whom scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set them weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a sound sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their places , jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that land and sea were covered with thick clouds , and night sprang forth out of the heavens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn , appeared , we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein the sea - nymphs hold their courts and dances , and i called the men together in council . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friends ,  said i , we have meat and drink in the ship , let us mind , therefore , and not touch the cattle , or we shall suffer for it; for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun , who sees and gives ear to everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and again they promised that they would obey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for a whole month the wind blew steadily from the south , and there was no other wind , but only south and east . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[105] as long as corn and wine held out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when , however , they had eaten all there was in the ship , they were forced to go further afield , with hook and line , catching birds , and taking whatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day , therefore , i went up inland that i might pray heaven to show me some means of getting away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - meanwhile eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men , listen to me ,  said he , my poor comrades . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all deaths are bad enough but there is none so bad as famine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why should not we drive in the best of these cows and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal gods? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if we ever get back to ithaca , we can build a fine temple to the sun - god and enrich it with every kind of ornament; if , however , he is determined to sink our ship out of revenge for these horned cattle , and the other gods are of the same mind , i for one would rather drink salt water once for all and have done with it , than be starved to death by inches in such a desert island as this is . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - thus spoke eurylochus , and the men approved his words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had done praying they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out the thigh bones , wrapped them round in two layers of fat , and set some pieces of raw meat on top of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had no wine with which to make drink - offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking , so they kept pouring on a little water from time to time while the inward meats were being grilled; then , when the thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats , they cut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the spits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by this time my deep sleep had left me , and i turned back to the ship and to the sea shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as i drew near i began to smell hot roast meat , so i groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if they do not square accounts with me about my cows , i will go down to hades and shine there among the dead . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - sun ,  said jove , go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over the fruitful earth . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i was told all this by calypso , who said she had heard it from the mouth of mercury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as soon as i got down to my ship and to the sea shore i rebuked each one of the men separately , but we could see no way out of it , for the cows were dead already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and indeed the gods began at once to show signs and wonders among us , for the hides of the cattle crawled about , and the joints upon the spits began to low like cows , and the meat , whether cooked or raw , kept on making a noise just as cows do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon them , but when jove the son of saturn had added a seventh day , the fury of the gale abated; we therefore went on board , raised our masts , spread sail , and put out to sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as we were well away from the island , and could see nothing but sky and sea , the son of saturn raised a black cloud over our ship , and the sea grew dark beneath it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we did not get on much further , for in another moment we were caught by a terrific squall from the west that snapped the forestays of the mast so that it fell aft , while all the ship s gear tumbled about at the bottom of the vessel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the men all fell into the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship , looking like so many sea - gulls , but the god presently deprived them of all chance of getting home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel ( which drifted about by itself ) and struck the mast out of her in the direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox - thong still hanging about it , and with this i lashed the mast and keel together , and getting astride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to take me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - [the gale from the west had now spent its force , and the wind got into the south again , which frightened me lest i should be taken back to the terrible whirlpool of charybdis . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this indeed was what actually happened , for i was borne along by the waves all night , and by sunrise had reached the rock of scylla , and the whirlpool . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was then sucking down the salt sea water ,[106] but i was carried aloft toward the fig tree , which i caught hold of and clung on to like a bat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could not plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely , for the roots were a long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too high , too vast , and too far apart for me to reach them; so i hung patiently on , waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft againand a very long while it seemed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a jury - man is not more glad to get home to supper , after having been long detained in court by troublesome cases , than i was to see my raft beginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for scylla , the father of gods and men would not let her get further sight of meotherwise i should have certainly been lost . </s> </s> 
[107]<s> <s>  - hence i was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the gods stranded me on the ogygian island , where dwells the great and powerful goddess calypso . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she took me in and was kind to me , but i need say no more about this , for i told you and your noble wife all about it yesterday , and i hate saying the same thing over and over again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses leaves scheria and returns to ithaca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to you others , however , who come here night after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard , i would insist as follows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our guest has already packed up the clothes , wrought gold ,[108] and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance; let us now , therefore , present him further , each one of us , with a large tripod and a cauldron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every one approved of this , and then they went home to bed each in his own abode . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn , appeared they hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they went to the house of alcinous to get dinner , and he sacrificed a bull for them in honour of jove who is the lord of all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they set the steaks to grill and made an excellent dinner , after which the inspired bard , demodocus , who was a favourite with every one , sang to them; but ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards the sun , as though to hasten his setting , for he was longing to be on his way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , and all of you , farewell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make your drink - offerings and send me on my way rejoicing , for you have fulfilled my heart s desire by giving me an escort , and making me presents , which heaven grant that i may turn to good account; may i find my admirable wife living in peace among friends ,[109] and may you whom i leave behind me give satisfaction to your wives and children;[110] may heaven vouchsafe you every good grace , and may no evil thing come among your people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did he speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his hearers all of them approved his saying and agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alcinous therefore said to his servant ,  - pontonous , mix some wine and hand it round to everybody , that we may offer a prayer to father jove , and speed our guest upon his way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - farewell , queen , said he ,  - henceforward and for ever , till age and death , the common lot of mankind , lay their hands upon you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i now take my leave; be happy in this house with your children , your people , and with king alcinous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he crossed the threshold , and alcinous sent a man to conduct him to his ship and to the sea shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> arete also sent some maidservants with himone with a clean shirt and cloak , another to carry his strong box , and a third with corn and wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they got to the water side the crew took these things and put them on board , with all the meat and drink; but for ulysses they spread a rug and a linen sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thereon , when they began rowing out to sea , ulysses fell into a deep , sweet , and almost deathlike slumber . </s> </s> 
[111]<s> <s> the ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies over the course when the horses feel the whip . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her prow curvetted as it were the neck of a stallion , and a great wave of dark blue water seethed in her wake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she held steadily on her course , and even a falcon , swiftest of all birds , could not have kept pace with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show , the ship drew near to land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[112] now there is in ithaca a haven of the old merman phorcys , which lies between two points that break the line of the sea and shut the harbour in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the head of this harbour there is a large olive tree , and at no great distance a fine overarching cavern sacred to the nymphs who are called naiads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it has two entrances , one facing north by which mortals can go down into the cave , while the other comes from the south and is more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it , it is the way taken by the gods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> into this harbour , then , they took their ship , for they knew the place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they put these all together by the root of the olive tree , away from the road , for fear some passer by[116] might come and steal them before ulysses awoke; and then they made the best of their way home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father jove , said he ,  - i shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods , if mortals like the phaeacians , who are my own flesh and blood , show such small regard for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i said i would let ulysses get home when he had suffered sufficiently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and jove answered ,  - what , o lord of the earthquake , are you talking about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gods are by no means wanting in respect for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as regards mortals , however , if any of them is indulging in insolence and treating you disrespectfully , it will always rest with yourself to deal with him as you may think proper , so do just as you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my good friend , answered jove ,  - i should recommend you at the very moment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way , to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when earth - encircling neptune heard this he went to scheria where the phaeacians live , and stayed there till the ship , which was making rapid way , had got close in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after this he went away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the phaeacians then began talking among themselves , and one would turn towards his neighbour , saying ,  - bless my heart , who is it that can have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we could see the whole of her only a moment ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was how they talked , but they knew nothing about it; and alcinous said ,  - i remember now the old prophecy of my father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was what my old father used to say , and now it is all coming true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[117] now therefore let us all do as i say; in the first place we must leave off giving people escorts when they come here , and in the next let us sacrifice twelve picked bulls to neptune that he may have mercy upon us , and not bury our city under the high mountain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the people heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did the chiefs and rulers of the phaeacians pray to king neptune , standing round his altar; and at the same time[118] ulysses woke up once more upon his own soil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything , therefore , seemed quite different to himthe long straight tracks , the harbours , the precipices , and the goodly trees , appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his native land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and cried aloud despairingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , he exclaimed ,  - among what manner of people am i fallen? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where shall i put all this treasure , and which way shall i go? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in good truth the chiefs and rulers of the phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by me , and have left me in the wrong country; they said they would take me back to ithaca and they have not done so: may jove the protector of suppliants chastise them , for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do wrong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons , his gold and all his clothes , but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about not being in his own country , and wandered up and down by the shore of the sounding sea bewailing his hard fate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then minerva came up to him disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien , with a good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friend , said he ,  - you are the first person whom i have met with in this country; i salute you , therefore , and beg you to be well disposed towards me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , then , and tell me truly , what land and country is this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> minerva answered ,  - stranger , you must be very simple , or must have come from somewhere a long way off , not to know what country this is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a very celebrated place , and everybody knows it east and west . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is rugged and not a good driving country , but it is by no means a bad island for what there is of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it grows any quantity of corn and also wine , for it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here , and there are watering places where the water never runs dry; so , sir , the name of ithaca is known even as far as troy , which i understand to be a long way off from this achaean country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses was glad at finding himself , as minerva told him , in his own country , and he began to answer , but he did not speak the truth , and made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i heard of ithaca , said he ,  - when i was in crete beyond the seas , and now it seems i have reached it with all these treasures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have left as much more behind me for my children , but am flying because i killed orsilochus son of idomeneus , the fleetest runner in crete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils i had got from troy with so much trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; he said i had not served his father loyally at troy as vassal , but had set myself up as an independent ruler , so i lay in wait for him with one of my followers by the road side , and speared him as he was coming into town from the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a very dark night and nobody saw us; it was not known , therefore , that i had killed him , but as soon as i had done so i went to a ship and besought the owners , who were phoenicians , to take me on board and set me in pylos or in elis where the epeans rule , giving them as much spoil as satisfied them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was all we could do to get inside the harbour , and none of us said a word about supper though we wanted it badly , but we all went on shore and lay down just as we were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they sailed away to sidonia , and i was left here in great distress of mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such was his story , but minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she took the form of a woman , fair , stately , and wise ,  - he must be indeed a shifty lying fellow , said she ,  - who could surpass you in all manner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dare devil that you are , full of guile , unwearying in deceit , can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood , even now that you are in your own country again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now , again , i am come here to talk things over with you , and help you to hide the treasure i made the phaeacians give you; i want to tell you about the troubles that await you in your own house; you have got to face them , but tell no one , neither man nor woman , that you have come home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[120] and now , i beseech you in your father s name , tell me the truth , for i do not believe i am really back in ithaca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am in some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all you have been saying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me then truly , have i really got back to my own country? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> any one but yourself on returning from so long a voyage would at once have gone home to see his wife and children , but you do not seem to care about asking after them or hearing any news about them till you have exploited your wife , who remains at home vainly grieving for you , and having no peace night or day for the tears she sheds on your behalf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for my not coming near you , i was never uneasy about you , for i was certain you would get back safely though you would lose all your men , and i did not wish to quarrel with my uncle neptune , who never forgave you for having blinded his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[121] i will now , however , point out to you the lie of the land , and you will then perhaps believe me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is the haven of the old merman phorcys , and here is the olive tree that grows at the head of it; [near it is the cave sacred to the naiads;[122] here too is the overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable hecatomb to the nymphs , and this is the wooded mountain neritum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land , and kissed the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs , saying ,  - naiad nymphs , daughters of jove , i made sure that i was never again to see you , now therefore i greet you with all loving salutations , and i will bring you offerings as in the old days , if jove s redoubtable daughter will grant me life , and bring my son to manhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take heart , and do not trouble yourself about that , rejoined minerva ,  - let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave , where they will be quite safe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us see how we can best manage it all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding places , while ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold , bronze , and good clothing which the phaeacians had given him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they stowed everything carefully away , and minerva set a stone against the door of the cave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the two sat down by the root of the great olive , and consulted how to compass the destruction of the wicked suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ulysses , said minerva ,  - noble son of laertes , think how you can lay hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it in your house these three years , courting your wife and making wedding presents to her , while she does nothing but lament your absence , giving hope and sending encouraging messages[123] to every one of them , but meaning the very opposite of all she says . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> advise me how i shall best avenge myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stand by my side and put your courage into my heart as on the day when we loosed troy s fair diadem from her brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> help me now as you did then , and i will fight three hundred men , if you , goddess , will be with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - trust me for that , said she ,  - i will not lose sight of you when once we set about it , and i imagine that some of those who are devouring your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their blood and brains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will begin by disguising you so that no human being shall know you; i will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall lose all your yellow hair; i will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all who see it with loathing; i will blear your fine eyes for you , and make you an unseemly object in the sight of the suitors , of your wife , and of the son whom you left behind you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stay with him and find out how things are going , while i proceed to sparta and see your son , who is with menelaus at lacedaemon , where he has gone to try and find out whether you are still alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating up his estate? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> minerva answered ,  - never mind about him , i sent him that he might be well spoken of for having gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is in no sort of difficulty , but is staying quite comfortably with menelaus , and is surrounded with abundance of every kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suitors have put out to sea and are lying in wait for him , for they mean to kill him before he can get home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not much think they will succeed , but rather that some of those who are now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the pair had thus laid their plans they parted , and the goddess went straight to lacedaemon to fetch telemachus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses now left the haven , and took the rough track up through the wooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the place where minerva had said that he would find the swineherd , who was the most thrifty servant he had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> outside the yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts , split , and set pretty close together , while inside he had built twelve styes near one another for the sows to lie in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were fifty pigs wallowing in each stye , all of them breeding sows; but the boars slept outside and were much fewer in number , for the suitors kept on eating them , and the swineherd had to send them the best he had continually . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were three hundred and sixty boar pigs , and the herdsman s four hounds , which were as fierce as wolves , slept always with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three of his men were out herding the pigs in one place or another , and he had sent the fourth to town with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors that they might sacrifice it and have their fill of meat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he said to ulysses ,  - old man , the dogs were likely to have made short work of you , and then you would have got me into trouble . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - there it was that i heard news of ulysses , for the king told me he had entertained him , and shown him much hospitality while he was on his homeward journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he showed me also the treasure of gold , and wrought iron that ulysses had got together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was enough to keep his family for ten generations , so much had he left in the house of king pheidon . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he sent me off however before ulysses returned , for there happened to be a thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat - growing island of dulichium , and he told those in charge of her to be sure and take me safely to king acastus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - these men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the very extreme of misery , for when the ship had got some way out from land they resolved on selling me as a slave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the gods soon undid my bonds for me , and having drawn my rags over my head i slid down the rudder into the sea , where i struck out and swam till i was well clear of them , and came ashore near a thick wood in which i lay concealed . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i know all about the return of my master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gods one and all of them detest him , or they would have taken him before troy , or let him die with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done; for then the achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his son would have been heir to his renown , but now the storm winds have spirited him away we know not whither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they all sit round and ask questions , both those who grieve over the king s absence , and those who rejoice at it because they can eat up his property without paying for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said ulysses would return in the following summer or autumn with his men , and that he would bring back much wealth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses answered ,  - i see that you are of an unbelieving mind; i have given you my oath , and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a bargain , and call all the gods in heaven to witness it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if your master comes home , give me a cloak and shirt of good wear , and send me to dulichium where i want to go; but if he does not come as i say he will , set your men on to me , and tell them to throw me from yonder precipice , as a warning to tramps not to go about the country telling lies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and a pretty figure i should cut then , replied eumaeus ,  - both now and hereafter , if i were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and showing you hospitality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should have to say my prayers in good earnest if i did; but it is just supper time and i hope my men will come in directly , that we may cook something savoury for supper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did they converse , and presently the swineherds came up with the pigs , which were then shut up for the night in their styes , and a tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs , while others reap the fruit of our labour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eumaeus did not forget the gods , for he was a man of good principles , so the first thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig s face and throw them into the fire , praying to all the gods as he did so that ulysses might return home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood , and stunned it , while the others slaughtered and singed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made seven portions; one of these he set apart for mercury the son of maia and the nymphs , praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he gave ulysses some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour , and ulysses was much pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope , eumaeus , said he ,  - that jove will be as well disposed towards you as i am , for the respect you are showing to an outcast like myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this you answered , o swineherd eumaeus ,  - eat , my good fellow , and enjoy your supper , such as it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had brought this man on his own account from among the taphians during his master s absence , and had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either to his mistress or laertes . </s> </s>

<s> <s> now the night came on stormy and very dark , for there was no moon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it poured without ceasing , and the wind blew strong from the west , which is a wet quarter , so ulysses thought he would see whether eumaeus , in the excellent care he took of him , would take off his own cloak and give it him , or make one of his men give him one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen to me , said he ,  - eumaeus and the rest of you; when i have said a prayer i will tell you something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing; it will make him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still , as i have begun , i will go on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would that i were still young and strong as when we got up an ambuscade before troy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we had come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our armour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood that grew about the swamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it came on to freeze with a north wind blowing; the snow fell small and fine like hoar frost , and our shields were coated thick with rime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the others had all got cloaks and shirts , and slept comfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders , but i had carelessly left my cloak behind me , not thinking that i should be too cold , and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the night was two - thirds through and the stars had shifted their places , i nudged ulysses who was close to me with my elbow , and he at once gave me his ear . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - ulysses , who was as crafty as he was valiant , hit upon the following plan: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - keep still ,  said he in a low voice , or the others will hear you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are a long way from the ships; i wish some one would go down and tell agamemnon to send us up more men at once . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - on this thoas son of andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running to the ships , whereon i took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough till morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would that i were still young and strong as i was in those days , for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak both out of good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier; but now people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and eumaeus answered ,  - old man , you have told us an excellent story , and have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the present , therefore , you shall want neither clothing nor anything else that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect , but to - morrow morning you have to shake your own old rags about your body again , for we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here , but every man has only one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this he got up and made a bed for ulysses by throwing some goatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here ulysses lay down , and eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs , so he got ready to go outside , and ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his property during his master s absence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first he slung his sword over his brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he also took the skin of a large and well fed goat , and a javelin in case of attack from men or dogs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus equipped he went to his rest where the pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from the north wind . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she found him and pisistratus sleeping in the forecourt of menelaus s house; pisistratus was fast asleep , but telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy father , so minerva went close up to him and said: </s> </s>

<s> <s> ask menelaus to send you home at once if you wish to find your excellent mother still there when you get back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the house in spite of you , but you know what women arethey always want to do the best they can for the man who marries them , and never give another thought to the children of their first husband , nor to their father either when he is dead and done with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go home , therefore , and put everything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you have , until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as soon as you get to ithaca send your ship and men on to the town , but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge of your pigs; he is well disposed towards you , stay with him , therefore , for the night , and then send him to penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from pylos . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she went back to olympus; but telemachus stirred pisistratus with his heel to rouse him , and said ,  - wake up pisistratus , and yoke the horses to the chariot , for we must set off home . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it will be morning soon; wait till menelaus has brought his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good bye to us in the usual way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so long as he lives a guest should never forget a host who has shown him kindness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke day began to break , and menelaus , who had already risen , leaving helen in bed , came towards them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or too rude to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moderation is best in all things , and not letting a man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would like to stay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one should treat a guest well as long as he is in the house and speed him when he wants to leave it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will tell the women to prepare a sufficient dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once more proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out on such a long journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if , moreover , you have a fancy for making a tour in hellas or in the peloponnese , i will yoke my horses , and will conduct you myself through all our principal cities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one will send us away empty handed; every one will give us somethinga bronze tripod , a couple of mules , or a gold cup . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - menelaus , replied telemachus ,  - i want to go home at once , for when i came away i left my property without protection , and fear that while looking for my father i shall come to ruin myself , or find that something valuable has been stolen during my absence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> [131] then they all came back through the house again till they got to telemachus , and menelaus said ,  - telemachus , may jove , the mighty husband of juno , bring you safely home according to your desire . </s> </s>

<s> <s> till then , get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go back rejoicing to your own country and to your home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then pisistratus put the presents into the chariot , and admired them all as he did so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently menelaus took telemachus and pisistratus into the house , and they both of them sat down to table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a maid servant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer , and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands , and she drew a clean table beside them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court , and menelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they might make a drink - offering before they set out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stood in front of the horses and pledged them , saying ,  - farewell to both of you; see that you tell nestor how i have treated you , for he was as kind to me as any father could be while we achaeans were fighting before troy . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when they saw it they were glad , and their hearts took comfort within them , whereon pisistratus said ,  - tell me , menelaus , has heaven sent this omen for us or for you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> menelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to make , but helen was too quick for him and said ,  - i will read this matter as heaven has put it in my heart , and as i doubt not that it will come to pass . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover , we are both of an age , and this journey has brought us together still more closely; do not , therefore , take me past my ship , but leave me there , for if i go to your father s house he will try to keep me in the warmth of his good will towards me , and i must go home at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked , and in the end he deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship , and put menelaus s beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i will not refuse you , replied telemachus ,  - if you wish to join us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , therefore , and in ithaca we will treat you hospitably according to what we have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this he received theoclymenus  spear and laid it down on the deck of the ship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they set the mast in its socket in the cross plank , raised it and made it fast with the forestays , and they hoisted their white sails with sheets of twisted ox hide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the hut , and the men supped with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as they had had to eat and drink , ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether he would continue to treat him kindly , and ask him to stay on at the station or pack him off to the city; so he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should like also to go to the house of ulysses and bring news of her husband to queen penelope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could then go about among the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - heaven help me , he exclaimed ,  - what ever can have put such a notion as that into your head? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they would never think of taking a man like you for a servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their servants are all young men , well dressed , wearing good cloaks and shirts , with well looking faces and their hair always tidy , the tables are kept quite clean and are loaded with bread , meat , and wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stay where you are , then; you are not in anybody s way; i do not mind your being here , no more do any of the others , and when telemachus comes home he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you want to go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses answered ,  - i hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are to me , for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble; there is nothing worse than being always on the tramp; still , when men have once got low down in the world they will go through a great deal on behalf of their miserable bellies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since , however , you press me to stay here and await the return of telemachus , tell me about ulysses  mother , and his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he set out for troy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are they still living or are they already dead and in the house of hades? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she came to an unhappy end[133] through sorrow for her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me come to such an end as she did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as long as she was still living , though she was always grieving , i used to like seeing her and asking her how she did , for she brought me up along with her daughter ctimene , the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together , and she made little difference between us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still it has pleased heaven to prosper my work in the situation which i now hold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses answered ,  - then you must have been a very little fellow , eumaeus , when you were taken so far away from your home and parents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , and tell me true , was the city in which your father and mother lived sacked and pillaged , or did some enemies carry you off when you were alone tending sheep or cattle , ship you off here , and sell you for whatever your master gave them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stranger , replied eumaeus ,  - as regards your question: sit still , make yourself comfortable , drink your wine , and listen to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the nights are now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed till bed time , too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one of the others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can then take my master s pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we too will sit here eating and drinking in the hut , and telling one another stories about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered much , and been buffeted about in the world , he takes pleasure in recalling the memory of sorrows that have long gone by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as regards your question , then , my tale is as follows: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may have heard of an island called syra that lies over above ortygia ,[134] where the land begins to turn round and look in another direction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[135] it is not very thickly peopled , but the soil is good , with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep , and it abounds with wine and wheat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dearth never comes there , nor are the people plagued by any sickness , but when they grow old apollo comes with diana and kills them with his painless shafts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it contains two communities , and the whole country is divided between these two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father ctesius son of ormenus , a man comparable to the gods , reigned over both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there happened to be a phoenician woman in my father s house , very tall and comely , and an excellent servant; these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing near their ship , seduced her , and cajoled her in ways that no woman can resist , no matter how good she may be by nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i come from sidon ,  said she , and am daughter to arybas , a man rolling in wealth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day as i was coming into the town from the country , some taphian pirates seized me and took me here over the sea , where they sold me to the man who owns this house , and he gave them their price for me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the man who had seduced her then said , would you like to come along with us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves? </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i will do so gladly ,  answered she , if you men will first swear me a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - they all swore as she told them , and when they had completed their oath the woman said , hush; and if any of your men meets me in the street or at the well , do not let him speak to me , for fear some one should go and tell my master , in which case he would suspect something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would put me in prison , and would have all of you murdered; keep your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can , and send me word when you have done loading . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am nurse to the son of the good man of the house , a funny little fellow just able to run about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will carry him off in your ship , and you will get a great deal of money for him if you take him and sell him in foreign parts . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - on this she went back to the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the phoenicians stayed a whole year till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise , and then , when they had got freight enough , they sent to tell the woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sun was now set , and darkness was over all the land , so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour , where the phoenician ship was lying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently the winds and waves took the ship to ithaca , where laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me , and thus it was that ever i came to set eyes upon this country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses answered ,  - eumaeus , i have heard the story of your misfortunes with the most lively interest and pity , but jove has given you good as well as evil , for in spite of everything you have a good master , who sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a good life , whereas i am still going about begging my way from city to city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did they converse , and they had only a very little time left for sleep , for it was soon daybreak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the mean time telemachus and his crew were nearing land , so they loosed the sails , took down the mast , and rowed the ship into the harbour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[136] they cast out their mooring stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore , mixed their wine , and got dinner ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink telemachus said ,  - take the ship on to the town , but leave me here , for i want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at any other time , replied telemachus ,  - i should have bidden you go to my own house , for you would find no want of hospitality; at the present moment , however , you would not be comfortable there , for i shall be away , and my mother will not see you; she does not often show herself even to the suitors , but sits at her loom weaving in an upper chamber , out of their way; but i can tell you a man whose house you can go toi mean eurymachus the son of polybus , who is held in the highest estimation by every one in ithaca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jove , however , in heaven alone knows whether or no they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right handa hawk , apollo s messenger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it held a dove in its talons , and the feathers , as it tore them off ,[138] fell to the ground midway between telemachus and the ship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as i saw it i knew it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there will be no house in ithaca more royal than your own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and piraeus answered ,  - telemachus , you may stay away as long as you please , but i will look after him for you , and he shall find no lack of hospitality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses reveals himself to telemachus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - eumaeus , i hear footsteps; i suppose one of your men or some one of your acquaintance is coming here , for the dogs are fawning upon him and not barking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eumaeus sprang to his feet , and the bowls in which he was mixing wine fell from his hands , as he made towards his master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a father could not be more delighted at the return of an only son , the child of his old age , after ten years  absence in a foreign country and after having gone through much hardship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so you are come , telemachus , light of my eyes that you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come in , my dear child , and sit down , that i may have a good look at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into the country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town generally . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the suitors are doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is still at the house , replied eumaeus ,  - grieving and breaking her heart , and doing nothing but weep , both night and day continually . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he took telemachus  spear , whereon he crossed the stone threshold and came inside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses rose from his seat to give him place as he entered , but telemachus checked him;  - sit down , stranger , said he ,  - i can easily find another seat , and there is one here who will lay it for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the swineherd brought them platters of cold meat , the remains from what they had eaten the day before , and he filled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they laid their hands on the good things that were before them , and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink telemachus said to eumaeus ,  - old friend , where does this stranger come from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how did his crew bring him to ithaca , and who were they? for assuredly he did not come here by land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he says he is a cretan , and that he has been a great traveller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment he is running away from a thesprotian ship , and has taken refuge at my station , so i will put him into your hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do whatever you like with him , only remember that he is your suppliant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can i take this stranger into my house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am as yet young , and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent way in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , do you submit to such treatment tamely , or has some god set your people against you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> may you not complain of your brothersfor it is to these that a man may look for support , however great his quarrel may be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wish i were as young as you are and in my present mind; if i were son to ulysses , or , indeed , ulysses himself , i would rather some one came and cut my head off , but i would go to the house and be the bane of every one of these men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and telemachus answered ,  - i will tell you truly everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jove has made us a race of only sons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> laertes was the only son of arceisius , and ulysses only son of laertes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am myself the only son of ulysses who left me behind him when he went away , so that i have never been of any use to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hence it comes that my house is in the hands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands , dulichium , same , zacynthus , as also all the principal men of ithaca itself , are eating up my house under the pretext of paying court to my mother , who will neither say point blank that she will not marry , nor yet bring matters to an end , so they are making havoc of my estate , and before long will do so with myself into the bargain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do you , old friend eumaeus , go at once and tell penelope that i am safe and have returned from pylos . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell it to herself alone , and then come back here without letting any one else know , for there are many who are plotting mischief against me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i understand and heed you , replied eumaeus;  - you need instruct me no further , only as i am going that way say whether i had not better let poor laertes know that you are returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he used to superintend the work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about ulysses , and he would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell me that from the day on which you set out for pylos he has neither eaten nor drunk as he ought to do , nor does he look after his farm , but sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - more s the pity , answered telemachus ,  - i am sorry for him , but we must leave him to himself just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell my mother to send one of her women secretly with the news at once , and let him hear it from her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did he urge the swineherd; eumaeus , therefore , took his sandals , bound them to his feet , and started for the town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> minerva watched him well off the station , and then came up to it in the form of a womanfair , stately , and wise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she stood against the side of the entry , and revealed herself to ulysses , but telemachus could not see her , and knew not that she was there , for the gods do not let themselves be seen by everybody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses saw her , and so did the dogs , for they did not bark , but went scared and whining off to the other side of the yards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ulysses , noble son of laertes , it is now time for you to tell your son: do not keep him in the dark any longer , but lay your plans for the destruction of the suitors , and then make for the town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will not be long in joining you , for i too am eager for the fray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she spoke she touched him with her golden wand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first she threw a fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him younger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour , filled out his cheeks , and let his beard become dark again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she went away and ulysses came back inside the hut . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stranger , said he ,  - how suddenly you have changed from what you were a moment or two ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have mercy upon me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am your father , on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the hands of lawless men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but telemachus could not yet believe that it was his father , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a second ago you were old and all in rags , and now you are like some god come down from heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses answered ,  - telemachus , you ought not to be so immeasurably astonished at my being really here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no other ulysses who will come hereafter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess minerva , who does with me whatever she will , for she can do what she pleases . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at one moment she makes me like a beggar , and the next i am a young man with good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he sat down , and telemachus threw his arms about his father and wept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were both so much moved that they cried aloud like eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their half fledged young by peasants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus piteously did they weep , and the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if telemachus had not suddenly said ,  - in what ship , my dear father , did your crew bring you to ithaca? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are great sailors , and are in the habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they took me over the sea while i was fast asleep , and landed me in ithaca , after giving me many presents in bronze , gold , and raiment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these things by heaven s mercy are lying concealed in a cave , and i am now come here on the suggestion of minerva that we may consult about killing our enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first , therefore , give me a list of the suitors , with their number , that i may learn who , and how many , they are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can then turn the matter over in my mind , and see whether we two can fight the whole body of them ourselves , or whether we must find others to help us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are not ten suitors only , nor twice ten , but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are fifty - two chosen youths from dulichium , and they have six servants; from same there are twenty - four; twenty young achaeans from zacynthus , and twelve from ithaca itself , all of them well born . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have with them a servant medon , a bard , and two men who can carve at table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if we face such numbers as this , you may have bitter cause to rue your coming , and your revenge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see whether you cannot think of some one who would be willing to come and help us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen to me , replied ulysses ,  - and think whether minerva and her father jove may seem sufficient , or whether i am to try and find some one else as well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - those whom you have named , answered telemachus ,  - are a couple of good allies , for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have power over both gods and men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - these two , continued ulysses ,  - will not keep long out of the fray , when the suitors and we join fight in my house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , therefore , return home early to - morrow morning , and go about among the suitors as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a miserable old beggar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> furthermore i say , and lay my saying to your heart; when minerva shall put it in my mind , i will nod my head to you , and on seeing me do this you must collect all the armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke , inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when ulysses went away , but has become soiled and begrimed with soot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me , and a couple of oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; jove and minerva will then soon quiet these people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is also another matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins , let no one know that ulysses is within the houseneither laertes , nor yet the swineherd , nor any of the servants , nor even penelope herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let you and me exploit the women alone , and let us also make trial of some other of the men servants , to see who is on our side and whose hand is against us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not think , however , the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> think it over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it will take us a long time to go the round of the farms and exploit the men , and all the time the suitors will be wasting your estate with impunity and without compunction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> prove the women by all means , to see who are disloyal and who guiltless , but i am not in favour of going round and trying the men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did they converse , and meanwhile the ship which had brought telemachus and his crew from pylos had reached the town of ithaca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land; their servants came and took their armour from them , and they left all the presents at the house of clytius . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they reached the house , the servant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the waiting women ,  - your son , madam , is now returned from pylos; but eumaeus went close up to penelope , and said privately all that her son had bidden him tell her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had given his message he left the house with its outbuildings and went back to his pigs again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eurymachus , son of polybus , was the first to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friends , said he ,  - this voyage of telemachus s is a very serious matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had hardly done speaking when amphinomus turned in his place and saw the ship inside the harbour , with the crew lowering her sails , and putting by their oars; so he laughed , and said to the others ,  - we need not send them any message , for they are here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some god must have told them , or else they saw the ship go by , and could not overtake her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this they rose and went to the water side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all day long , and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep , but waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us consider how we can make an end of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he must not escape us; our affair is never likely to come off while he is alive , for he is very shrewd , and public feeling is by no means all on our side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we must make haste before he can call the achaeans in assembly; he will lose no time in doing so , for he will be furious with us , and will tell all the world how we plotted to kill him , but failed to take him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the people will not like this when they come to know of it; we must see that they do us no hurt , nor drive us from our own country into exile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us try and lay hold of him either on his farm away from the town , or on the road hither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then we can divide up his property amongst us , and let his mother and the man who marries her have the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if this does not please you , and you wish telemachus to live on and hold his father s property , then we must not gather here and eat up his goods in this way , but must make our offers to penelope each from his own house , and she can marry the man who will give the most for her , and whose lot it is to win her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they all held their peace until amphinomus rose to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us first take counsel of the gods , and if the oracles of jove advise it , i will both help to kill him myself , and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade us , i would have you hold your hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she knew of the plot against telemachus , for the servant medon had overheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to the court attended by her maidens , and when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing - posts supporting the roof of the cloister holding a veil before her face , and rebuked antinous saying: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madman , why should you try to compass the death of telemachus , and take no heed of suppliants , whose witness is jove himself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not right for you to plot thus against one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had , but ulysses stayed their hands although they were infuriated , and now you devour his property without paying for it , and break my heart by wooing his wife and trying to kill his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leave off doing so , and stop the others also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man is not yet born , nor never will be , who shall lay hands upon your son telemachus , while i yet live to look upon the face of the earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i sayand it shall surely bethat my spear shall be reddened with his blood; for many a time has ulysses taken me on his knees , held wine up to my lips to drink , and put pieces of meat into my hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore telemachus is much the dearest friend i have , and has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the evening eumaeus got back to ulysses and his son , who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were helping one another to get supper ready; minerva therefore came up to ulysses , turned him into an old man with a stroke of her wand , and clad him in his old clothes again , for fear that the swineherd might recognise him and not keep the secret , but go and tell penelope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus was the first to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so you have got back , eumaeus , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the news of the town? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did not think of asking about that , replied eumaeus ,  - when i was in the town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on hearing this telemachus smiled to his father , but so that eumaeus could not see him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , when they had finished their work and the meal was ready , they ate it , and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink , they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn , appeared , telemachus bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands , for he wanted to go into the city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for this unfortunate stranger , take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who will give him a drink and a piece of bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have trouble enough of my own , and cannot be burdened with other people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if this makes him angry so much the worse for him , but i like to say what i mean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses said ,  - sir , i do not want to stay here; a beggar can always do better in town than country , for any one who likes can give him something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore let this man do as you have just told him , and take me to the town as soon as i have had a warm by the fire , and the day has got a little heat in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my clothes are wretchedly thin , and this frosty morning i shall be perished with cold , for you say the city is some way off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this telemachus strode off through the yards , brooding his revenge upon the suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he reached home he stood his spear against a bearing - post of the cloister , crossed the stone floor of the cloister itself , and went inside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nurse euryclea saw him long before any one else did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was putting the fleeces on to the seats , and she burst out crying as she ran up to him; all the other maids came up too , and covered his head and shoulders with their kisses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> penelope came out of her room looking like diana or venus , and wept as she flung her arms about her son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes ,  - light of my eyes , she cried as she spoke fondly to him ,  - so you are come home again; i made sure i was never going to see you any more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to think of your having gone off to pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining my consent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but come , tell me what you saw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not scold me , mother , answered telemachus ,  - nor vex me , seeing what a narrow escape i have had , but wash your face , change your dress , go upstairs with your maids , and promise full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if jove will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i sent him on with my crew , and told piraeus to take him home and look after him till i could come for him myself . </s> </s>

<s> <s> minerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went by , and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them , and went to sit with mentor , antiphus , and halitherses , old friends of his father s house , and they made him tell them all that had happened to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then piraeus came up with theoclymenus , whom he had escorted through the town to the place of assembly , whereon telemachus at once joined them . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - we do not know , piraeus , answered telemachus ,  - what may happen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if on the other hand i managed to kill them , i shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these words he took theoclymenus to his own house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they got there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats , went into the baths , and washed themselves . </s> </s>

<s> <s> a maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer , and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> opposite them sat penelope , reclining on a couch by one of the bearing - posts of the cloister , and spinning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they laid their hands on the good things that were before them , and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink penelope said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - telemachus , i shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch , which i have not ceased to water with my tears , from the day ulysses set out for troy with the sons of atreus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you failed , however , to make it clear to me before the suitors came back to the house , whether or no you had been able to hear anything about the return of your father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will tell you then truth , replied her son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we went to pylos and saw nestor , who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as though i were a son of his own who had just returned after a long absence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word from any human being about ulysses , whether he was alive or dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sent me , therefore , with a chariot and horses to menelaus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there i saw helen , for whose sake so many , both argives and trojans , were in heaven s wisdom doomed to suffer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> menelaus asked me what it was that had brought me to lacedaemon , and i told him the whole truth , whereon he said , so , then , these cowards would usurp a brave man s bed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a hind might as well lay her new - born young in the lair of a lion , and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lion , when he comes back to his lair , will make short work with the pair of them , and so will ulysses with these suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by father jove , minerva , and apollo , if ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with philomeleides in lesbos , and threw him so heavily that all the greeks cheered himif he is still such , and were to come near these suitors , they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said he could see ulysses on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph calypso , who was keeping him prisoner , and he could not reach his home , for he had no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  this was what menelaus told me , and when i had heard his story i came away; the gods then gave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then theoclymenus said to her: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madam , wife of ulysses , telemachus does not understand these things; listen therefore to me , for i can divine them surely , and will hide nothing from you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw an omen when i was on the ship which meant this , and i told telemachus about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may it be even so , answered penelope;  - if your words come true , you shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you shall congratulate you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did they converse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs , or aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the house , and behaving with all their old insolence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when it was now time for dinner , and the flock of sheep and goats had come into the town from all the country round , [140] with their shepherds as usual , then medon , who was their favourite servant , and who waited upon them at table , said ,  - now then , my young masters , you have had enough sport , so come inside that we may get dinner ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they left their sports as he told them , and when they were within the house , they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside , and then sacrificed some sheep , goats , pigs , and a heifer , all of them fat and well grown . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[141] thus they made ready for their meal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us then be off , for it is now broad day; it will be night again directly and then you will find it colder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us be going , but if you have a stick ready cut , let me have it to walk with , for you say the road is a very rough one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two then started , leaving the station in charge of the dogs and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his master followed after , looking like some broken down old tramp as he leaned upon his staff , and his clothes were all in rags . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had got over the rough steep ground and were nearing the city , they reached the fountain from which the citizens drew their water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a grove of water - loving poplars planted in a circle all round it , and the clear cold water came down to it from a rock high up ,[143] while above the fountain there was an altar to the nymphs , at which all wayfarers used to sacrifice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here melanthius son of dolius overtook them as he was driving down some goats , the best in his flock , for the suitors  dinner , and there were two shepherds with him . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - there you go , cried he ,  - and a precious pair you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where , pray , master swineherd , are you taking this poor miserable object? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would make any one sick to see such a creature at table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you would give him to me for a hand on my station , he might do to clean out the folds , or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids , and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but he has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind of work; he will do nothing but beg victuals all the town over , to feed his insatiable belly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say , thereforeand it shall surely beif he goes near ulysses  house he will get his head broken by the stools they will fling at him , till they turn him out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fountain nymphs , he cried ,  - children of jove , if ever ulysses burned you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids , grant my prayer that heaven may send him home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would soon put an end to the swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting peoplegadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin through bad shepherding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then melanthius the goatherd answered ,  - you ill conditioned cur , what are you talking about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some day or other i will put you on board ship and take you to a foreign country , where i can sell you and pocket the money you will fetch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wish i were as sure that apollo would strike telemachus dead this very day , or that the suitors would kill him , as i am that ulysses will never come home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servants brought him a portion of meat , and an upper woman servant set bread before him that he might eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently ulysses and the swineherd came up to the house and stood by it , amid a sound of music , for phemius was just beginning to sing to the suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses took hold of the swineherd s hand , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - eumaeus , this house of ulysses is a very fine place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no matter how far you go , you will find few like it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one building keeps following on after another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then eumaeus said ,  - you have perceived aright , as indeed you generally do; but let us think what will be our best course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you go inside first and join the suitors , leaving me here behind you , or will you wait here and let me go in first? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do not wait long , or some one may see you loitering about outside , and throw something at you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> consider this matter i pray you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and ulysses answered ,  - i understand and heed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go in first and leave me here where i am . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that i am case - hardened , and this too may go with the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but a man cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives much trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships are fitted out to sail the seas , and to make war upon other people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they were thus talking , a dog that had been lying asleep raised his head and pricked up his ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was argos , whom ulysses had bred before setting out for troy , but he had never had any work out of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went hunting wild goats , or deer , or hares , but now that his master was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of fleas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as he saw ulysses standing there , he dropped his ears and wagged his tail , but he could not get close up to his master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when ulysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard , he dashed a tear from his eyes without eumaeus seeing it , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - eumaeus , what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap: his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks , or is he only one of those dogs that come begging about a table , and are kept merely for show? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this hound , answered eumaeus ,  - belonged to him who has died in a far country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he were what he was when ulysses left for troy , he would soon show you what he could do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was not a wild beast in the forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the suitors were , but argos died as soon as he had recognised his master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the servant brought him his portion , and gave him bread from the bread - basket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> immediately afterwards ulysses came inside , looking like a poor miserable old beggar , leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in rags . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sat down upon the threshold of ash - wood just inside the doors leading from the outer to the inner court , and against a bearing - post of cypress - wood which the carpenter had skilfully planed , and had made to join truly with rule and line . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so eumaeus went up to him and said ,  - stranger , telemachus sends you this , and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging , for beggars must not be shamefaced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses answered ,  - may king jove grant all happiness to telemachus , and fulfil the desire of his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then with both hands he took what telemachus had sent him , and laid it on the dirty old wallet at his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went on eating it while the bard was singing , and had just finished his dinner as he left off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suitors applauded the bard , whereon minerva went up to ulysses and prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors , that he might see what kind of people they were , and tell the good from the bad; but come what might she was not going to save a single one of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some of them pitied him , and were curious about him , asking one another who he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd melanthius said ,  - suitors of my noble mistress , i can tell you something about him , for i have seen him before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the swineherd brought him here , but i know nothing about the man himself , nor where he comes from . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you precious idiot , he cried ,  - what have you brought this man to town for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have we not tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you think it a small thing that such people gather here to waste your master s propertyand must you needs bring this man as well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and eumaeus answered ,  - antinous , your birth is good but your words evil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was no doing of mine that he came here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such men are welcome all the world over , but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then turning to antinous he said ,  - antinous , you take as much care of my interests as though i were your son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why should you want to see this stranger turned out of the house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean , telemachus , replied antinous ,  - by this swaggering talk? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if all the suitors were to give him as much as i will , he would not come here again for another three months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from under the table , and made as though he would throw it at ulysses , but the other suitors all gave him something , and filled his wallet with bread and meat; he was about , therefore , to go back to the threshold and eat what the suitors had given him , but he first went up to antinous and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , give me something; you are not , surely , the poorest man here; you seem to be a chief , foremost among them all; therefore you should be the better giver , and i will tell far and wide of your bounty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i too was a rich man once , and had a fine house of my own; in those days i gave to many a tramp such as i now am , no matter who he might be nor what he wanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had any number of servants , and all the other things which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy , but it pleased jove to take all away from me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sent me with a band of roving robbers to egypt; it was a long voyage and i was undone by it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i stationed my ships in the river aegyptus , and bade my men stay by them and keep guard over them , while i sent out scouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the egyptians killed many of us , and took the rest alive to do forced labour for them; as for myself , they gave me to a friend who met them , to take to cyprus , dmetor by name , son of iasus , who was a great man in cyprus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thence i am come hither in a state of great misery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then antinous said ,  - what god can have sent such a pestilence to plague us during our dinner? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> get out , into the open part of the court ,[145] or i will give you egypt and cyprus over again for your insolence and importunity; you have begged of all the others , and they have given you lavishly , for they have abundance round them , and it is easy to be free with other people s property when there is plenty of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this ulysses began to move off , and said ,  - your looks , my fine sir , are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt , for though you are in another man s , and surrounded with abundance , you cannot find it in you to give him even a piece of bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this made antinous very angry , and he scowled at him saying ,  - you shall pay for this before you get clear of the court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went back to the threshold and sat down there , laying his well filled wallet at his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen to me , he cried ,  - you suitors of queen penelope , that i may speak even as i am minded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , if the poor have gods and avenging deities at all , i pray them that antinous may come to a bad end before his marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sit where you are , and eat your victuals in silence , or be off elsewhere , shouted antinous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other suitors were much displeased at this , and one of the young men said ,  - antinous , you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a tramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some godand we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as people from foreign countries , and travel about the world to see who do amiss and who righteously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile telemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to his father , and though no tear fell from him , he shook his head in silence and brooded on his revenge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now when penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the banqueting - cloister , she said before her maids ,  - would that apollo would so strike you , antinous , and her waiting woman eurynome answered ,  - if our prayers were answered not one of the suitors would ever again see the sun rise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a poor unfortunate tramp has come begging about the house for sheer want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every one else has given him something to put in his wallet , but antinous has hit him on the right shoulder - blade with a footstool . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room , and in the meantime ulysses was getting his dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he seems to have travelled much , and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this you answered , o swineherd eumaeus ,  - if these achaeans , madam , would only keep quiet , you would be charmed with the history of his adventures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had him three days and three nights with me in my hut , which was the first place he reached after running away from his ship , and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he says there is an old friendship between his house and that of ulysses , and that he comes from crete where the descendants of minos live , after having been driven hither and thither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he has heard of ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the thesprotians , and that he is bringing great wealth home with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - call him here , then , said penelope ,  - that i too may hear his story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the suitors , let them take their pleasure indoors or out as they will , for they have nothing to fret about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no estate can stand such recklessness , for we have now no ulysses to protect us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he were to come again , he and his son would soon have their revenge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she spoke telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> penelope laughed when she heard this , and said to eumaeus ,  - go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just as i was speaking? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this can only mean that all the suitors are going to be killed , and that not one of them shall escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when eumaeus heard this he went straight to ulysses and said ,  - father stranger , my mistress penelope , mother of telemachus , has sent for you; she is in great grief , but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her about her husband , and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the truth , she will give you a shirt and cloak , which are the very things that you are most in want of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for bread , you can get enough of that to fill your belly , by begging about the town , and letting those give that will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will tell penelope , answered ulysses ,  - nothing but what is strictly true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know all about her husband , and have been partner with him in affliction , but i am afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel suitors , for their pride and insolence reach heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just now , moreover , as i was going about the house without doing any harm , a man gave me a blow that hurt me very much , but neither telemachus nor any one else defended me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the swineherd went back when he heard this , and penelope said as she saw him cross the threshold ,  - why do you not bring him here , eumaeus? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is he afraid that some one will ill - treat him , or is he shy of coming inside the house at all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beggars should not be shamefaced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this you answered , o swineherd eumaeus ,  - the stranger is quite reasonable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is avoiding the suitors , and is only doing what any one else would do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she had done speaking eumaeus went back to the suitors , for he had explained everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went up to telemachus and said in his ear so that none could overhear him ,  - my dear sir , i will now go back to the pigs , to see after your property and my own business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will look to what is going on here , but above all be careful to keep out of danger , for there are many who bear you ill will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> may jove bring them to a bad end before they do us a mischief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well , replied telemachus ,  - go home when you have had your dinner , and in the morning come here with the victims we are to sacrifice for the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leave the rest to heaven and me . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this man had no strength nor stay in him , but he was a great hulking fellow to look at; his real name , the one his mother gave him , was arnaeus , but the young men of the place called him irus ,[148] because he used to run errands for any one who would send him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be off , old man , he cried ,  - from the doorway , or you shall be dragged out neck and heels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you not see that they are all giving me the wink , and wanting me to turn you out by force , only i do not like to do so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> get up then , and go of yourself , or we shall come to blows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses frowned on him and said ,  - my friend , i do you no manner of harm; people give you a great deal , but i am not jealous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is room enough in this doorway for the pair of us , and you need not grudge me things that are not yours to give . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall have more peace tomorrow if i do , for you will not come to the house of ulysses any more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> irus was very angry and answered ,  - you filthy glutton , you run on trippingly like an old fish - fag . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have a good mind to lay both hands about you , and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar s tusks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> get ready , therefore , and let these people here stand by and look on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front of the doorway ,[149] and when antinous saw what was going on he laughed heartily and said to the others ,  - this is the finest sport that you ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suitors all came up laughing , and gathered round the two ragged tramps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen to me , said antinous ,  - there are some goats  paunches down at the fire , which we have filled with blood and fat , and set aside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to be the better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the others all agreed , but ulysses , to throw them off the scent , said ,  - sirs , an old man like myself , worn out with suffering , cannot hold his own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on , though i know it can only end in my getting a drubbing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must swear , however that none of you will give me a foul blow to favour irus and secure him the victory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am host , and the other chiefs , antinous and eurymachus , both of them men of understanding , are of the same mind as i am . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every one assented , and ulysses girded his old rags about his loins , thus baring his stalwart thighs , his broad chest and shoulders , and his mighty arms; but minerva came up to him and made his limbs even stronger still . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suitors were beyond measure astonished , and one would turn towards his neighbour saying ,  - the stranger has brought such a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left of irus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> irus began to be very uneasy as he heard them , but the servants girded him by force , and brought him [into the open part of the court] in such a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> antinous scolded him and said ,  - you swaggering bully , you ought never to have been born at all if you are afraid of such an old broken down creature as this tramp is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say , thereforeand it shall surely beif he beats you and proves himself the better man , i shall pack you off on board ship to the mainland and send you to king echetus , who kills every one that comes near him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this frightened irus still more , but they brought him into the middle of the court , and the two men raised their hands to fight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they began to fight , and irus hit ulysses on the right shoulder; but ulysses gave irus a blow on the neck under the ear that broke in the bones of his skull , and the blood came gushing out of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust , gnashing his teeth and kicking on the ground , but the suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of laughter , as ulysses caught hold of him by the foot and dragged him into the outer court as far as the gate - house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sit here , said he ,  - and keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful creature , and if you try to make yourself king of the beggars any more you shall fare still worse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will take him over to the mainland presently , to king echetus , who kills every one that comes near him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses hailed this as of good omen , and antinous set a great goat s paunch before him filled with blood and fat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> amphinomus took two loaves out of the bread - basket and brought them to him , pledging him as he did so in a golden goblet of wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this ulysses answered ,  - amphinomus , you seem to be a man of good understanding , as indeed you may well be , seeing whose son you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as long as heaven vouchsafes him health and strength , he thinks that he shall come to no harm hereafter , and even when the blessed gods bring sorrow upon him , he bears it as he needs must , and makes the best of it; for god almighty gives men their daily minds day by day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know all about it , for i was a rich man once , and did much wrong in the stubbornness of my pride , and in the confidence that my father and my brothers would support me; therefore let a man fear god in all things always , and take the good that heaven may see fit to send him without vain glory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> consider the infamy of what these suitors are doing; see how they are wasting the estate , and doing dishonour to the wife , of one who is certain to return some day , and that , too , not long hence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nay , he will be here soon; may heaven send you home quietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of his coming , for once he is here the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he took his seat again at the place from which he had come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so she feigned a mocking laugh and said ,  - eurynome , i have changed my mind , and have a fancy to show myself to the suitors although i detest them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should like also to give my son a hint that he had better not have anything more to do with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they speak fairly enough but they mean mischief . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when you were younger you had a greater sense of propriety; now , however , that you are grown up , though a stranger to look at you would take you for the son of a well to do father as far as size and good looks go , your conduct is by no means what it should be . </s> </s>

<s> <s> thus did he speak , and his saying pleased them well , so mulius of dulichium , servant to amphinomus , mixed them a bowl of wine and water and handed it round to each of them man by man , whereon they made their drink - offerings to the blessed gods: then , when they had made their drink - offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded , they took their several ways each of them to his own abode . </s> </s>

<s> <s> surely there is some god here who has come down from heaven . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then penelope came down from her room looking like venus or diana , and they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the fire in her accustomed place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they emptied the embers out of the braziers , and heaped much wood upon them to give both light and heat; but melantho began to rail at ulysses a second time and said ,  - stranger , do you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all night and spying upon the women? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be off , you wretch , outside , and eat your supper there , or you shall be driven out with a firebrand . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i had any number of servants , and all the other things which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy , but it pleased jove to take all away from me; therefore , woman , beware lest you too come to lose that pride and place in which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you get out of favour with your mistress , and lest ulysses should come home , for there is still a chance that he may do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> penelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid ,  - impudent baggage , said she ,  - i see how abominably you are behaving , and you shall smart for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you knew perfectly well , for i told you myself , that i was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband , for whose sake i am in such continual sorrow . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i shall have one of the servants or even yourself complaining of me , and saying that my eyes swim with tears because i am heavy with wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then penelope answered ,  - stranger , heaven robbed me of all beauty , whether of face or figure , when the argives set sail for troy and my dear husband with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he were to return and look after my affairs i should be both more respected and should show a better presence to the world . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then i said to them , sweethearts , ulysses is indeed dead , still , do not press me to marry again immediately; waitfor i would not have my skill in needlework perish unrecordedtill i have finished making a pall for the hero laertes , to be ready against the time when death shall take him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is very rich , and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now i do not see how i can find any further shift for getting out of this marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , notwithstanding all this , tell me who you are and where you come fromfor you must have had father and mother of some sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses answered ,  - madam , wife of ulysses , since you persist in asking me about my family , i will answer , no matter what it costs me: people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long as i have , and suffered as much among as many peoples . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless , as regards your question i will tell you all you ask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a fair and fruitful island in mid - ocean called crete; it is thickly peopled and there are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different languages which overlap one another , for there are achaeans , brave eteocretans , dorians of three - fold race , and noble pelasgi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[152] minos was father to deucalion , whose son i am , for deucalion had two sons idomeneus and myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as he got there he went into the town and asked for idomeneus , claiming to be his old and valued friend , but idomeneus had already set sail for troy some ten or twelve days earlier , so i took him to my own house and showed him every kind of hospitality , for i had abundance of everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i suppose some unfriendly god had raised it for them , but on the thirteenth day the wind dropped , and they got away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many a plausible tale did ulysses further tell her , and penelope wept as she listened , for her heart was melted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the snow wastes upon the mountain tops when the winds from south east and west have breathed upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water , even so did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all the time sitting by her side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , then , how he was dressed , what kind of a man he was to look at , and so also with his companions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madam , answered ulysses ,  - it is such a long time ago that i can hardly say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twenty years are come and gone since he left my home , and went elsewhither; but i will tell you as well as i can recollect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool , double lined , and it was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the face of this there was a device that shewed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his fore paws , and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every one marvelled at the way in which these things had been done in gold , the dog looking at the fawn , and strangling it , while the fawn was struggling convulsively to escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[153] as for the shirt that he wore next his skin , it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an onion , and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women who beheld it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> furthermore i say , and lay my saying to your heart , that i do not know whether ulysses wore these clothes when he left home , or whether one of his companions had given them to him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a present of them , for he was a man of many friends and had few equals among the achaeans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle , double lined , with a shirt that went down to his feet , and i sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i took them out of the store room and folded them up myself , and i gave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall never welcome him home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that detested city whose very name i cannot bring myself even to mention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses answered ,  - madam , wife of ulysses , do not disfigure yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss , though i can hardly blame you for doing so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a woman who has loved her husband and borne him children , would naturally be grieved at losing him , even though he were a worse man than ulysses , who they say was like a god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , cease your tears and listen to what i can tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will hide nothing from you , and can say with perfect truth that i have lately heard of ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the thesprotians , and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were lost as they were leaving the thrinacian island , for jove and the sun - god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the sun - god s cattle , and they were all drowned to a man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but ulysses stuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the phaeacians , who are near of kin to the immortals , and who treated him as though he had been a god , giving him many presents , and wishing to escort him home safe and sound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sent me off first , for there happened to be a thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat - growing island of dulichium , but he showed me all the treasure ulysses had got together , and he had enough lying in the house of king pheidon to keep his family for ten generations; but the king said ulysses had gone to dodona that he might learn jove s mind from the high oak tree , and know whether after so long an absence he should return to ithaca openly or in secret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now , you maids , wash his feet for him , and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets , that he may be warm and quiet till morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it shall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to him; like it or not , he shall have no more to do in this house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for how , sir , shall you be able to learn whether or no i am superior to others of my sex both in goodness of heart and understanding , if i let you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses answered ,  - madam , i have foresworn rugs and blankets from the day that i left the snowy ranges of crete to go on shipboard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> night after night have i passed in any rough sleeping place , and waited for morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this penelope said ,  - my dear sir , of all the guests who ever yet came to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with such admirable propriety as you do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there happens to be in the house a most respectable old womanthe same who received my poor dear husband in her arms the night he was born , and nursed him in infancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is very feeble now , but she shall wash your feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come here , said she ,  - euryclea , and wash your master s age - mate; i suppose ulysses  hands and feet are very much the same now as his are , for trouble ages all of us dreadfully fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am certain no one was ever more god - fearing than yourself , and yet jove hates you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one in the whole world ever burned him more thigh bones , nor gave him finer hecatombs when you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see your son grow up to take after you: yet see how he has prevented you alone from ever getting back to your own home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not wonder at your not choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have insulted you; i will wash your feet myself gladly enough , as penelope has said that i am to do so; i will wash them both for penelope s sake and for your own , for you have raised the most lively feelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover , which pray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before now , but i make bold to say that no one ever yet came who was so like ulysses in figure , voice , and feet as you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - those who have seen us both , answered ulysses ,  - have always said we were wonderfully like each other , and now you have noticed it too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash his feet , and poured plenty of cold water into it , adding hot till the bath was warm enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses sat by the fire , but ere long he turned away from the light , for it occurred to him that when the old woman had hold of his leg she would recognise a certain scar which it bore , whereon the whole truth would come out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> parnassus with his excellent grandfather autolycuswho was the most accomplished thief and perjurer in the whole worldand with the sons of autolycus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercury himself had endowed him with this gift , for he used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to him , so he took pleasure in his companionship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened once that autolycus had gone to ithaca and had found the child of his daughter just born . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as he had done supper euryclea set the infant upon his knees and said ,  - autolycus , you must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - son - in - law and daughter , replied autolycus ,  - call the child thus: i am highly displeased with a large number of people in one place and another , both men and women; so name the child ulysses ,  or the child of anger . </s> </s>

<s> <s> thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted , and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the sun set and it came on dark , they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the child of morning , rosy - fingered dawn , appeared , the sons of autolycus went out with their hounds hunting , and ulysses went too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they climbed the wooded slopes of parnassus and soon reached its breezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields , fresh - risen from the slow still currents of oceanus , they came to a mountain dell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the beast they were chasing , and after them came the sons of autolycus , among whom was ulysses , close behind the dogs , and he had a long spear in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick brushwood , so dense that the wind and rain could not get through it , nor could the sun s rays pierce it , and the ground underneath lay thick with fallen leaves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boar heard the noise of the men s feet , and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him , so he rushed from his lair , raised the bristles on his neck , and stood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses was the first to raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute , but the boar was too quick for him , and charged him sideways , ripping him above the knee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the boar , ulysses hit him on the right shoulder , and the point of the spear went right through him , so that he fell groaning in the dust until the life went out of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sons of autolycus busied themselves with the carcass of the boar , and bound ulysses  wound; then , after saying a spell to stop the bleeding , they went home as fast as they could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well hold of it , she recognised it and dropped the foot at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the leg fell into the bath , which rang out and was overturned , so that all the water was spilt on the ground; euryclea s eyes between her joy and her grief filled with tears , and she could not speak , but she caught ulysses by the beard and said ,  - my dear child , i am sure you must be ulysses himself , only i did not know you till i had actually touched and handled you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to recognise me , hold your tongue , and do not say a word about it to any one else in the house , for if you do i tell youand it shall surely bethat if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors , i will not spare you , though you are my own nurse , when i am killing the other women . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my child , answered euryclea ,  - what are you talking about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know very well that nothing can either bend or break me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will hold my tongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say , and lay my saying to your heart , when heaven has delivered the suitors into your hand , i will give you a list of the women in the house who have been ill - behaved , and of those who are guiltless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and ulysses answered ,  - nurse , you ought not to speak in that way; i am well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your tongue and leave everything to heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he said this euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water , for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and anointed him with oil , ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to warm himself , and hid the scar under his rags . </s> </s>

<s> <s> presently he soared off into the sky , and left them lying dead about the yard; whereon i wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me , so piteously was i grieving because the eagle had killed my geese . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he came back again , and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with human voice , and told me to leave off crying . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  on this i woke , and when i looked out i saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this dream , madam , replied ulysses ,  - can admit but of one interpretation , for had not ulysses himself told you how it shall be fulfilled? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and penelope answered ,  - stranger , dreams are very curious and unaccountable things , and they do not by any means invariably come true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed; the one is of horn , and the other ivory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those that come through the gate of ivory are fatuous , but those from the gate of horn mean something to those that see them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not think , however , that my own dream came through the gate of horn , though i and my son should be most thankful if it proves to have done so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> furthermore i sayand lay my saying to your heartthe coming dawn will usher in the ill - omened day that is to sever me from the house of ulysses , for i am about to hold a tournament of axes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my husband used to set up twelve axes in the court , one in front of the other , like the stays upon which a ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot an arrow through the whole twelve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall make the suitors try to do the same thing , and whichever of them can string the bow most easily , and send his arrow through all the twelve axes , him will i follow , and quit this house of my lawful husband , so goodly and so abounding in wealth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but even so , i doubt not that i shall remember it in my dreams . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses answered ,  - madam , wife of ulysses , you need not defer your tournament , for ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow , handle it how they will , and send their arrows through the iron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , people cannot do permanently without sleep , and heaven has appointed us dwellers on earth a time for all things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will therefore go upstairs and recline upon that couch which i have never ceased to flood with my tears from the day ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then went upstairs to her own room , not alone , but attended by her maidens , and when there , she lamented her dear husband till minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyelids . </s> </s>

<s> <s> ulysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock s hide , on the top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten , and eurynome[156] threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there , then , ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which he should kill the suitors; and by and by , the women who had been in the habit of misconducting themselves with them , left the house giggling and laughing with one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his heart growled within him , and as a bitch with puppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger , so did his heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being done: but he beat his breast and said ,  - heart , be still , you had worse than this to bear on the day when the terrible cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you safe out of the cave , though you made sure of being killed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but by and by minerva came down from heaven in the likeness of a woman , and hovered over his head saying ,  - my poor unhappy man , why do you lie awake in this way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is your house: your wife is safe inside it , and so is your son who is just such a young man as any father may be proud of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - goddess , answered ulysses ,  - all that you have said is true , but i am in some doubt as to how i shall be able to kill these wicked suitors single handed , seeing what a number of them there always are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and there is this further difficulty , which is still more considerable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> supposing that with jove s and your assistance i succeed in killing them , i must ask you to consider where i am to escape to from their avengers when it is all over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for shame , replied minerva ,  - why , any one else would trust a worse ally than myself , even though that ally were only a mortal and less wise than i am . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> am i not a goddess , and have i not protected you throughout in all your troubles? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i tell you plainly that even though there were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us , you should take all their sheep and cattle , and drive them away with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes , and then went back to olympus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that eased the burden of his sorrows , his admirable wife awoke , and sitting up in her bed began to cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she had relieved herself by weeping she prayed to diana saying ,  - great goddess diana , daughter of jove , drive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the mouths of over - flowing oceanus , as it did the daughters of pandareus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the daughters of pandareus lost their father and mother , for the gods killed them , so they were left orphans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> juno taught them to excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; diana gave them an imposing presence , and minerva endowed them with every kind of accomplishment; but one day when venus had gone up to olympus to see jove about getting them married ( for well does he know both what shall happen and what not happen to every one ) the storm winds came and spirited them away to become handmaids to the dread erinyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , no matter how much people may grieve by day , they can put up with it so long as they can sleep at night , for when the eyes are closed in slumber people forget good and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in my dreams . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this very night methought there was one lying by my side who was like ulysses as he was when he went away with his host , and i rejoiced , for i believed that it was no dream , but the very truth itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this the day broke , but ulysses heard the sound of her weeping , and it puzzled him , for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by his side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had lain , and set them on a seat in the cloister , but he took the bullock s hide out into the open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high up among the clouds from the splendour of olympus , and ulysses was glad when he heard it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time within the house , a miller - woman from hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another sign . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were twelve miller - women whose business it was to grind wheat and barley which are the staff of life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the others had ground their task and had gone to take their rest , but this one had not yet finished , for she was not so strong as they were , and when she heard the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have worn me out with labour of grinding meal for them , and i hope they may never have another dinner anywhere at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman s speech , and by the thunder , for he knew they meant that he should avenge himself on the suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth; telemachus also rose and put on his clothes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he girded his sword about his shoulder , bound his sandals on to his comely feet , and took a doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold of the cloister and said to euryclea ,  - nurse , did you make the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board , or did you let him shift for himself? for my mother , good woman though she is , has a way of paying great attention to second - rate people , and of neglecting others who are in reality much better men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but euryclea called the maids and said ,  - come , wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down the tables , some of you , with a wet sponge; clean out the mixing - jugs and the cups , and go for water from the fountain at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early , for it is a feast day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did she speak , and they did even as she had said: twenty of them went to the fountain for water , and the others set themselves busily to work about the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the men who were in attendance on the suitors also came up and began chopping firewood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these he let feed about the premises , and then he said good - humouredly to ulysses ,  - stranger , are the suitors treating you any better now , or are they as insolent as ever? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may heaven , answered ulysses ,  - requite to them the wickedness with which they deal high - handedly in another man s house without any sense of shame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did they converse; meanwhile melanthius the goatherd came up , for he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors  dinner; and he had two shepherds with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they tied the goats up under the gatehouse , and then melanthius began gibing at ulysses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you still here , stranger , said he ,  - to pester people by begging about the house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you and i shall not come to an understanding before we have given each other a taste of our fists . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then a third man , philoetius , joined them , who was bringing in a barren heifer and some goats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these were brought over by the boatmen who are there to take people over when any one comes to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is he one of your men? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is his family? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where does he come from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he went up to ulysses and saluted him with his right hand;  - good day to you , father stranger , said he ,  - you seem to be very poorly off now , but i hope you will have better times by and by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> father jove , of all gods you are the most malicious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are your own children , yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a sweat came over me when i saw this man , and my eyes filled with tears , for he reminds me of ulysses , who i fear is going about in just such rags as this man s are , if indeed he is still among the living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he is already dead and in the house of hades , then , alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have often thoughtonly it would not be right while his son is livingof going off with the cattle to some foreign country; bad as this would be , it is still harder to stay here and be ill - treated about other people s herds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my position is intolerable , and i should long since have run away and put myself under the protection of some other chief , only that i believe my poor master will yet return , and send all these suitors flying out of the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stockman , answered ulysses ,  - you seem to be a very well - disposed person , and i can see that you are a man of sense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by jove , the chief of all gods , and by that hearth of ulysses to which i am now come , ulysses shall return before you leave this place , and if you are so minded you shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if jove were to bring this to pass , replied the stockman ,  - you should see how i would do my very utmost to help him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and in like manner eumaeus prayed that ulysses might return home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to murder telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left handan eagle with a dove in its talons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this amphinomus said ,  - my friends , this plot of ours to murder telemachus will not succeed; let us go to dinner instead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the others assented , so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the benches and seats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they mixed the wine in the mixing - bowls , and the swineherd gave every man his cup , while philoetius handed round the bread in the bread baskets , and melanthius poured them out their wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will put a stop to the gibes and blows of the suitors , for this is no public house , but belongs to ulysses , and has passed from him to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore , suitors , keep your hands and your tongues to yourselves , or there will be mischief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suitors bit their lips , and marvelled at the boldness of his speech; then antinous said ,  - we do not like such language but we will put up with it , for telemachus is threatening us in good earnest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if jove had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus spoke antinous , but telemachus heeded him not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city , and the achaeans gathered under the shady grove of apollo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they roasted the outer meat , drew it off the spits , gave every man his portion , and feasted to their heart s content; those who waited at table gave ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had , for telemachus had told them to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their insolence , for she wanted ulysses to become still more bitter against them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow , whose name was ctesippus , and who came from same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man , confident in his great wealth , was paying court to the wife of ulysses , and said to the suitors ,  - hear what i have to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger has already had as large a portion as any one else; this is well , for it is not right nor reasonable to ill - treat any guest of telemachus who comes here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will , however , make him a present on my own account , that he may have something to give to the bath - woman , or to some other of ulysses  servants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he picked up a heifer s foot from the meat - basket in which it lay , and threw it at ulysses , but ulysses turned his head a little aside , and avoided it , smiling grimly sardinian fashion[159] as he did so , and it hit the wall , not him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you had hit him i should have run you through with my spear , and your father would have had to see about getting you buried rather than married in this house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you , for i am grown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on , instead of being the child that i have been heretofore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have long seen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: i have put up with this , for one man is no match for many , but do me no further violence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , if you wish to kill me , kill me; i would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after dayguests insulted , and men dragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they all held their peace till at last agelaus son of damastor said ,  - no one should take offence at what has just been said , nor gainsay it , for it is quite reasonable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leave off , therefore , ill - treating the stranger , or any one else of the servants who are about the house; i would say , however , a friendly word to telemachus and his mother , which i trust may commend itself to both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as long ,  i would say , as you had ground for hoping that ulysses would one day come home , no one could complain of your waiting and suffering[160] the suitors to be in your house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would have been better that he should have returned , but it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all this quietly over with your mother , and tell her to marry the best man , and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus you will yourself be able to manage your own inheritance , and to eat and drink in peace , while your mother will look after some other man s house , not yours . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> to this telemachus answered ,  - by jove , agelaus , and by the sorrows of my unhappy father , who has either perished far from ithaca , or is wandering in some distant land , i throw no obstacles in the way of my mother s marriage; on the contrary i urge her to choose whomsoever she will , and i will give her numberless gifts into the bargain , but i dare not insist point blank that she shall leave the house against her own wishes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> heaven forbid that i should do this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> minerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately , and set their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears , and their hearts were heavy with forebodings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> theoclymenus saw this and said ,  - unhappy men , what is it that ails you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot , your cheeks are wet with tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof - beams drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted out of heaven , and a blighting gloom is over all the land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eurymachus then said ,  - this stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but theoclymenus said ,  - eurymachus , you need not send any one with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he left the house as he spoke , and went back to piraeus who gave him welcome , but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking telemachus by laughing at the strangers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one insolent fellow said to him ,  - telemachus , you are not happy in your guests; first you have this importunate tramp , who comes begging bread and wine and has no skill for work or for hard fighting , but is perfectly useless , and now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as a prophet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me persuade you , for it will be much better to put them on board ship and send them off to the sicels to sell for what they will bring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus gave him no heed , but sat silently watching his father , expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the daughter of icarius , wise penelope , had had a rich seat placed for her facing the court and cloisters , so that she could hear what every one was saying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the trial of the axes , during which ulysses reveals himself to eumaeus and philoetius<s> <s> minerva now put it in penelope s mind to make the suitors try their skill with the bow and with the iron axes , in contest among themselves , as a means of bringing about their destruction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she went upstairs and got the store - room key , which was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory; she then went with her maidens into the store - room at the end of the house , where her husband s treasures of gold , bronze , and wrought iron were kept , and where was also his bow , and the quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in lacedaemoniphitus the son of eurytus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two fell in with one another in messene at the house of ortilochus , where ulysses was staying in order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the messenians had carried off three hundred sheep from ithaca , and had sailed away with them and with their shepherds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in quest of these ulysses took a long journey while still quite young , for his father and the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> iphitus had gone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had lost , and the mule foals that were running with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these mares were the death of him in the end , for when he went to the house of jove s son , mighty hercules , who performed such prodigies of valour , hercules to his shame killed him , though he was his guest , for he feared not heaven s vengeance , nor yet respected his own table which he had set before iphitus , but killed him in spite of everything , and kept the mares himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was when claiming these that iphitus met ulysses , and gave him the bow which mighty eurytus had been used to carry , and which on his death had been left by him to his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses gave him in return a sword and a spear , and this was the beginning of a fast friendship , although they never visited at one another s houses , for jove s son hercules killed iphitus ere they could do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this bow , then , given him by iphitus , had not been taken with him by ulysses when he sailed for troy; he had used it so long as he had been at home , but had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store - room; the carpenter had planed this duly , and had drawn a line on it so as to get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the doors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she loosed the strap from the handle of the door , put in the key , and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held the doors;[161] these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a meadow , and penelope stepped upon the raised platform , where the chests stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with fragrant herbs: reaching thence , she took down the bow with its bow case from the peg on which it hung . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen to me you suitors , who persist in abusing the hospitality of this house because its owner has been long absent , and without other pretext than that you want to marry me; this , then , being the prize that you are contending for , i will bring out the mighty bow of ulysses , and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his arrow through each one of twelve axes , him will i follow and quit this house of my lawful husband , so goodly , and so abounding in wealth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she spoke , she told eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron before the suitors , and eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had bidden him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hard by , the stockman wept also when he saw his master s bow , but antinous scolded them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she has enough to grieve her in the loss of her husband; sit still , therefore , and eat your dinners in silence , or go outside if you want to cry , and leave the bow behind you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we suitors shall have to contend for it with might and main , for we shall find it no light matter to string such a bow as this is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then telemachus spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - great heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he exclaimed ,  - jove must have robbed me of my senses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here is my dear and excellent mother saying she will quit this house and marry again , yet i am laughing and enjoying myself as though there were nothing happening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , suitors , as the contest has been agreed upon , let it go forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come on , then , make no excuses for delay , but let us see whether you can string the bow or no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i too will make trial of it , for if i can string it and shoot through the iron , i shall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger , not if i can win the prizes which my father won before me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first he set the axes in a row , in a long groove which he had dug for them , and had made straight by line . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[162] then he stamped the earth tight round them , and everyone was surprised when they saw him set them up so orderly , though he had never seen anything of the kind before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you others , therefore , who are stronger than i , make trial of the bow and get this contest settled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this he put the bow down , letting it lean against the door [that led into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen , and antinous said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come on each of you in his turn , going towards the right from the place at which the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rest agreed , and leiodes son of oenops was the first to rise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> [163] he was the only man who hated their evil deeds and was indignant with the others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - leiodes , what are you talking about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall , then , this bow take the life of many a chief among us , merely because you cannot bend it yourself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> true , you were not born to be an archer , but there are others who will soon string it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he said to melanthius the goatherd ,  - look sharp , light a fire in the court , and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also a large ball of lard , from what they have in the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the house , and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it , but they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless there still remained antinous and eurymachus , who were the ringleaders among the suitors and much the foremost among them all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together , and ulysses followed them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had got outside the gates and the outer yard , ulysses said to them quietly: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stockman , and you swineherd , i have something in my mind which i am in doubt whether to say or no; but i think i will say it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what manner of men would you be to stand by ulysses , if some god should bring him back here all of a sudden? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> say which you are disposed to doto side with the suitors , or with ulysses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father jove , answered the stockman ,  - would indeed that you might so ordain it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in like words eumaeus prayed to all the gods that ulysses might return; when , therefore , he saw for certain what mind they were of , ulysses said ,  - it is i , ulysses , who am here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to you two , therefore , will i unfold the truth as it shall be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands , i will find wives for both of you , will give you house and holding close to my own , and you shall be to me as though you were brothers and friends of telemachus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will now give you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see , here is the scar from the boar s tooth that ripped me when i was out hunting on mt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> parnassus with the sons of autolycus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar , and when they had examined it thoroughly , they both of them wept about ulysses , threw their arms round him , and kissed his head and shoulders , while ulysses kissed their hands and faces in return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if ulysses had not checked them and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house , they must not come out; they must keep quiet , and stay where they are at their work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and i charge you , philoetius , to make fast the doors of the outer court , and to bind them securely at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had thus spoken , he went back to the house and took the seat that he had left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently , his two servants followed him inside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment the bow was in the hands of eurymachus , who was warming it by the fire , but even so he could not string it , and he was greatly grieved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he heaved a deep sigh and said ,  - i grieve for myself and for us all; i grieve that i shall have to forgo the marriage , but i do not care nearly so much about this , for there are plenty of other women in ithaca and elsewhere; what i feel most is the fact of our being so inferior to ulysses in strength that we cannot string his bow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it shall not be so , eurymachus , said antinous ,  - and you know it yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> today is the feast of apollo throughout all the land; who can string a bow on such a day as this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> put it on one sideas for the axes they can stay where they are , for no one is likely to come to the house and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups , that we may make our drink - offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will tell melanthius to bring us in some goats tomorrowthe best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to apollo the mighty archer , and again make trial of the bow , so as to bring the contest to an end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - suitors of the illustrious queen , listen that i may speak even as i am minded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i appeal more especially to eurymachus , and to antinous who has just spoken with so much reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the moment , however , give me the bow that i may prove the power of my hands among you all , and see whether i still have as much strength as i used to have , or whether travel and neglect have made an end of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this made them all very angry , for they feared he might string the bow , antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying ,  - wretched creature , you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your betters , without having any smaller portion served you than we others have had , and in being allowed to hear our conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was wine that inflamed the centaur eurytion when he was staying with peirithous among the lapithae . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the wine had got into his head , he went mad and did ill deeds about the house of peirithous; this angered the heroes who were there assembled , so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and nostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the house , so he went away crazed , and bore the burden of his crime , bereft of understanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> henceforth , therefore , there was war between mankind and the centaurs , but he brought it upon himself through his own drunkenness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in like manner i can tell you that it will go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one here , for we shall at once ship you off to king echetus , who kills every one that comes near him: you will never get away alive , so drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger than yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - queen penelope , answered eurymachus ,  - we do not suppose that this man will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest some of the baser sort , men or women among the achaeans , should go gossiping about and say , these suitors are a feeble folk; they are paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was able to string , and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  this is what will be said , and it will be a scandal against us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - eurymachus , penelope answered ,  - people who persist in eating up the estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect others to think well of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this stranger is strong and well - built , he says moreover that he is of noble birth . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i sayand it shall surely bethat if apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it , i will give him a cloak and shirt of good wear , with a javelin to keep off dogs and robbers , and a sharp sword . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will also give him sandals , and will see him sent safely wherever he wants to go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then telemachus said ,  - mother , i am the only man either in ithaca or in the islands that are over against elis who has the right to let any one have the bow or to refuse it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one shall force me one way or the other , not even though i choose to make the stranger a present of the bow outright , and let him take it away with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go , then , within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties , your loom , your distaff , and the ordering of your servants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she went wondering back into the house , and laid her son s saying in her heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room , she mourned her dear husband till minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to ulysses , but the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters , and one of them said ,  - you idiot , where are you taking the bow to? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you out of your wits? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if apollo and the other gods will grant our prayer , your own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place , and worry you to death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised , so he put the bow down then and there , but telemachus shouted out at him from the other side of the cloisters , and threatened him saying ,  - father eumaeus , bring the bow on in spite of them , or young as i am i will pelt you with stones back to the country , for i am the better man of the two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wish i was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as i am than you , i would soon send some of them off sick and sorry , for they mean mischief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did he speak , and they all of them laughed heartily , which put them in a better humour with telemachus; so eumaeus brought the bow on and placed it in the hands of ulysses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had done this , he called euryclea apart and said to her ,  - euryclea , telemachus says you are to close the doors of the women s apartments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house , they are not to come out , but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at their work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the outer court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then would one turn towards his neighbour saying ,  - this is some tricky old bow - fancier; either he has got one like it at home , or he wants to make one , in such workmanlike style does the old vagabond handle it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but ulysses , when he had taken it up and examined it all over , strung it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes the twisted gut fast at both ends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suitors were dismayed , and turned colour as they heard it; at that moment , moreover , jove thundered loudly as a sign , and the heart of ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the son of scheming saturn had sent him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had taken aim he let fly , and his arrow pierced every one of the handle - holes of the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them , and into the outer courtyard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , however , it is time for the achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight , and then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are the crowning ornaments of a banquet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows , and telemachus girded on his sword , grasped his spear , and stood armed beside his father s seat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the killing of the suitorsthe maids who have misconducted themselves are made to cleanse the cloisters and are then hanged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses tore off his rags , and sprang on to the broad pavement with his bow and his quiver full of arrows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shed the arrows on to the ground at his feet and said ,  - the mighty contest is at an end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will now see whether apollo will vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark which no man has yet hit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this he aimed a deadly arrow at antinous , who was about to take up a two - handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had no thought of deathwho amongst all the revellers would think that one man , however brave , would stand alone among so many and kill him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the arrow struck antinous in the throat , and the point went clean through his neck , so that he fell over and the cup dropped from his hand , while a thick stream of blood gushed from his nostrils . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he kicked the table from him and upset the things on it , so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[166] the suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked everywhere towards the walls , but there was neither shield nor spear , and they rebuked ulysses very angrily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stranger , said they ,  - you shall pay for shooting people in this way: you shall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you have slain was the foremost youth in ithaca , and the vultures shall devour you for having killed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dogs , did you think that i should not come back from troy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have wasted my substance ,[167] have forced my women servants to lie with you , and have wooed my wife while i was still living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have feared neither god nor man , and now you shall die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they turned pale with fear as he spoke , and every man looked round about to see whither he might fly for safety , but eurymachus alone spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you are ulysses , said he ,  - then what you have said is just . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have done much wrong on your lands and in your house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but antinous who was the head and front of the offending lies low already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was all his doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will make everything good among ourselves , and pay you in full for all that we have eaten and drunk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen , and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> until we have done this no one can complain of your being enraged against us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses again glared at him and said ,  - though you should give me all that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have , i will not stay my hand till i have paid all of you in full . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must fight , or fly for your lives; and fly , not a man of you shall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their hearts sank as they heard him , but eurymachus again spoke saying: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friends , this man will give us no quarter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he will stand where he is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us then show fight; draw your swords , and hold up the tables to shield you from his arrows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us have at him with a rush , to drive him from the pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town , and raise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at ulysses to try and get him away from the door; but telemachus was too quick for him , and struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and went right through his chest , so that he fell heavily to the ground and struck the earth with his forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then telemachus sprang away from him , leaving his spear still in the body , for he feared that if he stayed to draw it out , some one of the achaeans might come up and hack at him with his sword , or knock him down , so he set off at a run , and immediately was at his father s side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father , let me bring you a shield , two spears , and a brass helmet for your temples . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will arm myself as well , and will bring other armour for the swineherd and the stockman , for we had better be armed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus did as his father said , and went off to the store room where the armour was kept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he chose four shields , eight spears , and four brass helmets with horse - hair plumes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he brought them with all speed to his father , and armed himself first , while the stockman and the swineherd also put on their armour , and took their places near ulysses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile ulysses , as long as his arrows lasted , had been shooting the suitors one by one , and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows gave out , he set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the door post , and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet , well wrought with a crest of horse - hair that nodded menacingly above it ,[168] and he grasped two redoubtable bronze - shod spears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now there was a trap door[169] on the wall , while at one end of the pavement[170] there was an exit leading to a narrow passage , and this exit was closed by a well - made door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses told philoetius to stand by this door and guard it , for only one person could attack it at a time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> help would come at once , and we should soon make an end of this man and his shooting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one brave man could prevent any number from getting in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i know what i will do , i will bring you arms from the store - room , for i am sure it is there that ulysses and his son have put them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this the goatherd melanthius went by back passages to the store - room of ulysses  house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses  heart began to fail him when he saw the suitors[171] putting on their armour and brandishing their spears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus answered ,  - the fault , father , is mine , and mine only; i left the store room door open , and they have kept a sharper look out than i have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go , eumaeus , put the door to , and see whether it is one of the women who is doing this , or whether , as i suspect , it is melanthius the son of dolius . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did they converse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile melanthius was again going to the store room to fetch more armour , but the swineherd saw him and said to ulysses who was beside him ,  - ulysses , noble son of laertes , it is that scoundrel melanthius , just as we suspected , who is going to the store room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> say , shall i kill him , if i can get the better of him , or shall i bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many wrongs that he has done in your house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses answered ,  - telemachus and i will hold these suitors in check , no matter what they do; go back both of you and bind melanthius  hands and feet behind him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> throw him into the store room and make the door fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body , and string him close up to the rafters from a high bearing - post ,[172] that he may linger on in an agony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus did he speak , and they did even as he had said; they went to the store room , which they entered before melanthius saw them , for he was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room , so the two took their stand on either side of the door and waited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will know very well when morning comes from the streams of oceanus , and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for the suitors to feast on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there , then , they left him in very cruel bondage , and having put on their armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take their places by the side of ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the cloister , fierce and full of fury; nevertheless , those who were in the body of the court were still both brave and many . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then jove s daughter minerva came up to them , having assumed the voice and form of mentor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses was glad when he saw her and said ,  - mentor , lend me your help , and forget not your old comrade , nor the many good turns he has done you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , you are my age - mate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> agelaus was the first to reproach her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mentor , he cried ,  - do not let ulysses beguile you into siding with him and fighting the suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is what we will do: when we have killed these people , father and son , we will kill you too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this made minerva still more furious , so she scolded ulysses very angrily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[173]  - ulysses , said she ,  - your strength and prowess are no longer what they were when you fought for nine long years among the trojans about the noble lady helen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you killed many a man in those days , and it was through your stratagem that priam s city was taken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your own ground , face to face with the suitors in your own house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come on , my good fellow , stand by my side and see how mentor , son of alcimus shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she would not give him full victory as yet , for she wished still further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son , so she flew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in the form of a swallow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile agelaus son of damastor , eurynomus , amphimedon , demoptolemus , pisander , and polybus son of polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon the suitors  side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives they were by far the most valiant , for the others had already fallen under the arrows of ulysses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> agelaus shouted to them and said ,  - my friends , he will soon have to leave off , for mentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but brag . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are standing at the doors unsupported . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they threw their spears as he bade them , but minerva made them all of no effect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one hit the door post; another went against the door; the pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they had avoided all the spears of the suitors ulysses said to his own men ,  - my friends , i should say we too had better let drive into the middle of them , or they will crown all the harm they have done us by killing us outright . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses killed demoptolemus , telemachus euryades , eumaeus elatus , while the stockman killed pisander . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suitors now aimed a second time , but again minerva made their weapons for the most part without effect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one hit a bearing - post of the cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft of another struck the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , amphimedon just took a piece of the top skin from off telemachus s wrist , and ctesippus managed to graze eumaeus s shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd of suitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses hit eurydamas , telemachus amphimedon , and eumaeus polybus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i make you a present of this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave ulysses when he was begging about in his own house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus spoke the stockman , and ulysses struck the son of damastor with a spear in close fight , while telemachus hit leocritus son of evenor in the belly , and the dart went clean through him , so that he fell forward full on his face upon the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then minerva from her seat on the rafter held up her deadly aegis , and the hearts of the suitors quailed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their longest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as eagle - beaked , crook - taloned vultures from the mountains swoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground , and kill them , for they cannot either fight or fly , and lookers on enjoy the sporteven so did ulysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite them on every side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they made a horrible groaning as their brains were being battered in , and the ground seethed with their blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leiodes then caught the knees of ulysses and said ,  - ulysses i beseech you have mercy upon me and spare me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never wronged any of the women in your house either in word or deed , and i tried to stop the others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw them , but they would not listen , and now they are paying for their folly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me , i shall die without having done anything to deserve it , and shall have got no thanks for all the good that i did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses looked sternly at him and answered ,  - if you were their sacrificing priest , you must have prayed many a time that it might be long before i got home again , and that you might marry my wife and have children by her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore you shall die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these words he picked up the sword that agelaus had dropped when he was being killed , and which was lying upon the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he struck leiodes on the back of his neck , so that his head fell rolling in the dust while he was yet speaking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was standing near towards the trap door ,[174] and held his lyre in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar of jove that was in the outer court , and on which both laertes and ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox , or whether to go straight up to ulysses and embrace his knees , but in the end he deemed it best to embrace ulysses  knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he laid his lyre on the ground between the mixing bowl [175] and the silver - studded seat; then going up to ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said ,  - ulysses , i beseech you have mercy on me and spare me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i make all my lays myself , and heaven visits me with every kind of inspiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would sing to you as though you were a god , do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your own son telemachus will tell you that i did not want to frequent your house and sing to the suitors after their meals , but they were too many and too strong for me , so they made me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> medon caught these words of telemachus , for he was crouching under a seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly flayed heifer s hide , so he threw off the hide , went up to telemachus , and laid hold of his knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go , therefore , outside the cloisters into the outer court , and be out of the way of the slaughteryou and the bardwhile i finish my work here inside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pair went into the outer court as fast as they could , and sat down by jove s great altar , looking fearfully round , and still expecting that they would be killed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea , and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the heat of the sun makes an end of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even so were the suitors lying all huddled up one against the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ulysses said to telemachus ,  - call nurse euryclea; i have something to say to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus went and knocked at the door of the women s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women s room and came out , following telemachus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she found ulysses among the corpses bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring an ox , and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody , so that he is a fearful sight; even so was ulysses besmirched from head to foot with gore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of blood , she was beginning to cry out for joy , for she saw that a great deed had been done; but ulysses checked her ,  - old woman , said he ,  - rejoice in silence; restrain yourself , and do not make any noise about it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> heaven s doom and their own evil deeds have brought these men to destruction , for they respected no man in the whole world , neither rich nor poor , who came near them , and they have come to a bad end as a punishment for their wickedness and folly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , however , tell me which of the women in the house have misconducted themselves , and who are innocent . </s> </s> 
[176]<s> <s>  - i will tell you the truth , my son , answered euryclea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there are fifty women in the house whom we teach to do things , such as carding wool , and all kinds of household work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of these , twelve in all[177] have misbehaved , and have been wanting in respect to me , and also to penelope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they showed no disrespect to telemachus , for he has only lately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders to the female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife all that has happened , for some god has been sending her to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> euryclea left the cloister to tell the women , and make them come to ulysses; in the meantime he called telemachus , the stockman , and the swineherd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - begin , said he ,  - to remove the dead , and make the women help you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables and seats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this the women came down in a body , weeping and wailing bitterly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first they carried the dead bodies out , and propped them up against one another in the gatehouse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had done this , they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and water , while telemachus and the two others shovelled up the blood and dirt from the ground , and the women carried it all away and put it out of doors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying he made a ship s cable fast to one of the bearing - posts that supported the roof of the domed room , and secured it all around the building , at a good height , lest any of the women s feet should touch the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their nest , and a terrible fate awaits them , even so did the women have to put their heads in nooses one after the other and die most miserably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for melanthius , they took him through the cloister into the inner court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his vitals and gave them to the dogs raw , and then in their fury they cut off his hands and his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all that you have said is true , answered euryclea ,  - but let me bring you some clean clothesa shirt and cloak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not keep these rags on your back any longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she brought the fire and sulphur , as he had bidden her , and ulysses thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she went inside to call the women and tell them what had happened; whereon they came from their apartment with torches in their hands , and pressed round ulysses to embrace him , kissing his head and shoulders and taking hold of his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it made him feel as if he should like to weep , for he remembered every one of them . </s> </s> 
[179]<s> <s> penelope eventually recognises her husbandearly in the morning ulysses , telemachus , eumaeus , and philoetius leave the town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> euryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear husband had come home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her aged knees became young again and her feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her head to speak to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses has at last indeed come home again , and has killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble in his house , eating up his estate and ill treating his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why should you thus mock me when i have trouble enough alreadytalking such nonsense , and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my eyes and closed them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have never slept so soundly from the day my poor husband went to that city with the ill - omened name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go back again into the women s room; if it had been any one else who had woke me up to bring me such absurd news i should have sent her away with a severe scolding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as it is your age shall protect you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was the stranger whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus knew all the time that he was come back , but kept his father s secret that he might have his revenge on all these wicked people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then penelope sprang up from her couch , threw her arms round euryclea , and wept for joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but my dear nurse , said she ,  - explain this to me; if he has really come home as you say , how did he manage to overcome the wicked suitors single handed , seeing what a number of them there always were? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was not there , answered euryclea ,  - and do not know; i only heard them groaning while they were being killed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we sat crouching and huddled up in a corner of the women s room with the doors closed , till your son came to fetch me because his father sent him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he has sent me to call you , so come with me that you may both be happy together after all; for now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband is come home to find both wife and son alive and well , and to take his revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved so badly to him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this was the last thing about which he told her , for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this they did , and armed themselves . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then mercury of cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors , and in his hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men s eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts and led them , while they followed whining and gibbering behind him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave , when one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang , even so did the ghosts whine and squeal as mercury the healer of sorrow led them down into the dark abode of death . </s> </s>

<s> <s> better for you had you fallen at troy in the hey - day of your renown , for the achaeans would have built a mound over your ashes , and your son would have been heir to your good name , whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - happy son of peleus , answered the ghost of agamemnon ,  - for having died at troy far from argos , while the bravest of the trojans and the achaeans fell round you fighting for your body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we fought the whole of the livelong day , nor should we ever have left off if jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray , we laid you on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your mother , when she heard , came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea , and the sound of a great wailing went forth over the waters so that the achaeans quaked for fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they would have fled panic - stricken to their ships had not wise old nestor whose counsel was ever truest checked them saying , hold , argives , fly not sons of the achaeans , this is his mother coming from the sea with her immortal nymphs to view the body of her son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> days and nights seven and ten we mourned you , mortals and immortals , but on the eighteenth day we gave you to the flames , and many a fat sheep with many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you were burnt in raiment of the gods , with rich resins and with honey , while heroes , horse and foot , clashed their armour round the pile as you were burning , with the tramp as of a great multitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when the flames of heaven had done their work , we gathered your white bones at daybreak and laid them in ointments and in pure wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your mother brought us a golden vase to hold themgift of bacchus , and work of vulcan himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones with those of patroclus who had gone before you , and separate we enclosed also those of antilochus , who had been closer to you than any other of your comrades now that patroclus was no more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - over these the host of the argives built a noble tomb , on a point jutting out over the open hellespont , that it might be seen from far out upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born hereafter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your mother begged prizes from the gods , and offered them to be contended for by the noblest of the achaeans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must have been present at the funeral of many a hero , when the young men gird themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some great chieftain , but you never saw such prizes as silver - footed thetis offered in your honour; for the gods loved you well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus even in death your fame , achilles , has not been lost , and your name lives evermore among all mankind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as for me , what solace had i when the days of my fighting were done? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for jove willed my destruction on my return , by the hands of aegisthus and those of my wicked wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ghosts of agamemnon and achilles were astonished at seeing them , and went up to them at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one could pick no finer body of men from any city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> answer my question , for i have been your guest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you not remember how i came to your house with menelaus , to persuade ulysses to join us with his ships against troy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a whole month ere we could resume our voyage , for we had hard work to persuade ulysses to come with us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses had been long gone , and we were courting his wife , who did not say point blank that she would not marry , nor yet bring matters to an end , for she meant to compass our destruction: this , then , was the trick she played us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she set up a great tambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sweethearts ,  said she , ulysses is indeed dead , still , do not press me to marry again immediately; waitfor i would not have my skill in needlework perish unrecordedtill i have completed a pall for the hero laertes , against the time when death shall take him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is very rich , and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she fooled us in this way for three years without our finding it out , but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth year , in the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished , one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us , and we caught her in the act of undoing her work , so she had to finish it whether she would or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made , after she had had it washed ,[186] its splendour was as that of the sun or moon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then some malicious god conveyed ulysses to the upland farm where his swineherd lives . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thither presently came also his son , returning from a voyage to pylos , and the two came to the town when they had hatched their plot for our destruction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> telemachus came first , and then after him , accompanied by the swineherd , came ulysses , clad in rags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured his arrows on the ground , glaring fiercely about him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this , agamemnon , is how we came by our end , and our bodies are lying still uncared for in the house of ulysses , for our friends at home do not yet know what has happened , so that they cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from our wounds , making moan over us according to the offices due to the departed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fame , therefore , of her virtue shall never die , and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of penelope . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as he went down into the great orchard , he did not see dolius , nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen , for they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard , at the place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his father alone , hoeing a vine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had on a dirty old shirt , patched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him from the brambles , and he also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat skin cap on his head , and was looking very woe - begone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when ulysses saw him so worn , so old and full of sorrow , he stood still under a tall pear tree and began to weep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he doubted whether to embrace him , kiss him , and tell him all about his having come home , or whether he should first question him and see what he would say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him , so in this mind he went up to his father , who was bending down and digging about a plant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i trust , however , that you will not be offended if i say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are old , unsavoury , and very meanly clad . </s> </s>

<s> <s> neither his mother , nor i his father , who were his parents , could throw our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud , nor could his excellent and richly dowered wife penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon his death bed , and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or were you a passenger on some other man s ship , and those who brought you here have gone on their way and left you? </s> </s>

<s> <s> as for my ship it is lying over yonder , off the open country outside the town , and this is the fifth year since ulysses left my country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the birds all flew on our right hands , and both he and i rejoiced to see them as we parted , for we had every hope that we should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he filled both hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey head , groaning heavily as he did so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the heart of ulysses was touched , and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang towards him , flung his arms about him and kissed him , saying ,  - i am he , father , about whom you are askingi have returned after having been away for twenty years . </s> </s>

<s> <s> laertes  strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which his son had given him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he threw his arms about him , and ulysses had to support him , or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he came to , and was beginning to recover his senses , he said ,  - o father jove , then you gods are still in olympus after all , if the suitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless , i am much afraid that i shall have all the townspeople of ithaca up here directly , and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the cities of the cephallenians . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses answered ,  - take heart and do not trouble yourself about that , but let us go into the house hard by your garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have already told telemachus , philoetius , and eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready as soon as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus conversing the two made their way towards the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they got there they found telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting up meat and mixing wine with water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she put him on a good cloak , and minerva came up to him and gave him a more imposing presence , making him taller and stouter than before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he came back his son was surprised to see him looking so like an immortal , and said to him ,  - my dear father , some one of the gods has been making you much taller and better - looking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> laertes answered ,  - would , by father jove , minerva , and apollo , that i were the man i was when i ruled among the cephallenians , and took nericum , that strong fortress on the foreland . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he thought he was going to avenge the murder of his son , whereas in truth he was never to return , but was himself to perish in his attempt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you set them fighting still further , or will you make peace between them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and jove answered ,  - my child , why should you ask me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it not by your own arrangement that ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the suitors? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now that ulysses is revenged , let them swear to a solemn covenant , in virtue of which he shall continue to rule , while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre of their sons and brothers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was what minerva was already eager to bring about , so down she darted from off the topmost summits of olympus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now when laertes and the others had done dinner , ulysses began by saying ,  - some of you go out and see if they are not getting close up to us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so one of dolius s sons went as he was bid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they put on their armour as fast as they couldthat is to say ulysses , his three men , and the six sons of dolius . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> laertes also and dolius did the samewarriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had all put on their armour , they opened the gate and sallied forth , ulysses leading the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then jove s daughter minerva came up to them , having assumed the form and voice of mentor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ulysses was glad when he saw her , and said to his son telemachus ,  - telemachus , now that you are about to fight in an engagement , which will show every man s mettle , be sure not to disgrace your ancestors , who were eminent for their strength and courage all the world over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> laertes was delighted when he heard this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my son and grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this minerva came close up to him and said ,  - son of arceisius - best friend i have in the worldpray to the blue - eyed damsel , and to jove her father; then poise your spear and hurl it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him , and when he had prayed to her he poised his spear and hurled it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he hit eupeithes  helmet , and the spear went right through it , for the helmet stayed it not , and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of the goddess  voice , and they fled back to the city for their lives . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but ulysses gave a great cry , and gathering himself together swooped down like a soaring eagle . </s> </s>
