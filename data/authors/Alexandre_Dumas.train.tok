<s> <s> as usual , a pilot put off immediately , and rounding the chteau d if , got on board the vessel between cape morgiou and rion island . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> immediately , and according to custom , the ramparts of fort saint - jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at marseilles for a ship to come into port , especially when this ship , like the pharaon , has been built , rigged , and laden at the old phocee docks , and belongs to an owner of the city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred , it was not to the vessel herself , for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled , the anchor a - cockbill , the jib - boom guys already eased off , and standing by the side of the pilot , who was steering the pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port , was a young man , who , with activity and vigilant eye , watched every motion of the ship , and repeated each direction of the pilot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor , but jumping into a small skiff , desired to be pulled alongside the pharaon , which he reached as she rounded into la rserve basin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the young man on board saw this person approach , he left his station by the pilot , and , hat in hand , leaned over the ship s bulwarks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a fine , tall , slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty , with black eyes , and hair as dark as a raven s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , is it you , dants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the man in the skiff . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , replied the young man ,  - a great misfortune , for me especially! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> off civita vecchia we lost our brave captain leclere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and the cargo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the owner , eagerly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel; and i think you will be satisfied on that head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but poor captain leclere<s> <s>  - what happened to him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the owner , with an air of considerable resignation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what happened to the worthy captain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fell into the sea? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir , he died of brain - fever in dreadful agony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then turning to the crew , he said ,  - bear a hand there , to take in sail! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed , and then turned again to the owner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and how did this misfortune occur? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , sir , in the most unexpected manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a long talk with the harbor - master , captain leclere left naples greatly disturbed in mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in twenty - four hours he was attacked by a fever , and died three days afterwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was worth while , truly , added the young man with a melancholy smile ,  - to make war against the english for ten years , and to die in his bed at last , like everybody else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , you see , edmond , replied the owner , who appeared more comforted at every moment ,  - we are all mortal , and the old must make way for the young . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if not , why , there would be no promotion; and since you assure me that the cargo<s> <s>  - is all safe and sound , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , take my word for it; and i advise you not to take 25 ,000 francs for the profits of the voyage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man - of - war . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let goand clue up! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this last command all the sails were lowered , and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , if you will come on board , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , said dants , observing the owner s impatience ,  - here is your supercargo , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , coming out of his cabin , who will furnish you with every particular . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for me , i must look after the anchoring , and dress the ship in mourning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he seized a rope which dants flung to him , and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor , climbed up the side of the ship , while the young man , going to his task , left the conversation to danglars , who now came towards the owner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , said danglars ,  - you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yesyes: poor captain leclere! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and a first - rate seaman , one who had seen long and honorable service , as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel & son , replied danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said danglars , darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely was the captain s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone , and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the island of elba , instead of making for marseilles direct . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , and this day and a half was lost from pure whim , for the pleasure of going ashore , and nothing else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dants , said the shipowner , turning towards the young man ,  - come this way! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in a moment , sir , answered dants ,  - and i m with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the anchor was instantly dropped , and the chain ran rattling through the port - hole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot , until this manuvre was completed , and then he added ,  - half - mast the colors , and square the yards! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and so , in fact , he is , said the owner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the owner;  - he is young , it is true , but he seems to me a thorough seaman , and of full experience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a cloud passed over danglars  brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , said dants , approaching ,  - the vessel now rides at anchor , and i am at your service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you hailed me , i think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know , sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere , who , when dying , gave me a packet for marshal bertrand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the marshal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you saw the emperor , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he entered the marshal s apartment while i was there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what did he say to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - asked me questions about the vessel , the time she left marseilles , the course she had taken , and what was her cargo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i believe , if she had not been laden , and i had been her master , he would have bought her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i told him i was only mate , and that she belonged to the firm of morrel & son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , yes ,  he said , i know them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the morrels have been shipowners from father to son; and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - pardieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and that is true! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the owner , greatly delighted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that was policar morrel , my uncle , who was afterwards a captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants , you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him , and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier s eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , come , continued he , patting edmond s shoulder kindly ,  - you did very right , dants , to follow captain leclere s instructions , and touch at elba , although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal , and had conversed with the emperor , it might bring you into trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how could that bring me into trouble , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked dants;  - for i did not even know of what i was the bearer; and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dants has done his , replied the owner ,  - and that is not saying much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was captain leclere who gave orders for this delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - talking of captain leclere , has not dants given you a letter from him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to me? nowas there one? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i believe that , besides the packet , captain leclere confided a letter to his care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of what packet are you speaking , danglars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , that which dants left at porto - ferrajo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how do you know he had a packet to leave at porto - ferrajo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was passing close to the door of the captain s cabin , which was half open , and i saw him give the packet and letter to dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he did not speak to me of it , replied the shipowner;  - but if there be any letter he will give it to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars reflected for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the owner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have not been long detained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you have nothing more to do here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - noeverything is all right now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i really must ask you to excuse me , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my first visit is due to my father , though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - right , dants , quite right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i always knew you were a good son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and , inquired dants , with some hesitation ,  - do you know how my father is? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i believe , my dear edmond , though i have not seen him lately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that proves , at least , that he has wanted for nothing during your absence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my father is proud , sir , and if he had not a meal left , i doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone , except from heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , after this first visit has been made we shall count on you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , for after this first visit has been paid i have another which i am most anxious to pay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , dants , i forgot that there was at the catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your fatherthe lovely mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants blushed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , ha , said the shipowner ,  - i am not in the least surprised , for she has been to me three times , inquiring if there were any news of the pharaon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peste! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond , you have a very handsome mistress! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is not my mistress , replied the young sailor , gravely;  - she is my betrothed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sometimes one and the same thing , said morrel , with a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not with us , sir , replied dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well , my dear edmond , continued the owner ,  - don t let me detain you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have managed my affairs so well that i ought to allow you all the time you require for your own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you want any money? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are a careful fellow , edmond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - say i have a poor father , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , i know how good a son you are , so now hasten away to see your father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have a son too , and i should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months  voyage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i have your leave , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , if you have nothing more to say to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - captain leclere did not , before he died , give you a letter for me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he was unable to write , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to get married? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo , and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that; only be back again in three months , for the pharaon , added the owner , patting the young sailor on the back ,  - cannot sail without her captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - without her captain! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried dants , his eyes sparkling with animation;  - pray mind what you say , for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it really your intention to make me captain of the pharaon? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i were sole owner we d shake hands on it now , my dear dants , and call it settled; but i have a partner , and you know the italian proverbchi ha compagno ha padronehe who has a partner has a master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but the thing is at least half done , as you have one out of two votes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , exclaimed the young seaman , with tears in his eyes , and grasping the owner s hand ,  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , i thank you in the name of my father and of mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there s a providence that watches over the deserving . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go to your father; go and see mercds , and afterwards come to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you been satisfied with him this voyage? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is according to the sense you attach to the question , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you mean is he a good comrade? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough , after a little quarrel we had , to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the disputea proposition which i was wrong to suggest , and he quite right to refuse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but tell me , dants , if you had command of the pharaon should you be glad to see danglars remain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - captain or mate , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s right , that s right , dants! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i see you are a thoroughly good fellow , and will detain you no longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go , for i see how impatient you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i have leave? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go , i tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may i have the use of your skiff? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope soon to see you again , my dear edmond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good luck to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two oarsmen bent to their work , and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai d orlans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the shipowner , smiling , followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng , which from five o clock in the morning until nine o clock at night , swarms in the famous street of la canebire ,a street of which the modern phocens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world , and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said ,  - if paris had la canebire , paris would be a second marseilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him , apparently awaiting orders , but in reality also watching the young sailor ,but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred , and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade , and follow dants , who , after having traversed la canebire , took the rue de noailles , and entering a small house , on the left of the alles de meilhan , rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase , holding the baluster with one hand , while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart , and paused before a half - open door , from which he could see the whole of a small room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this room was occupied by dants  father . </s> </s>

<s> <s> suddenly , he felt an arm thrown around his body , and a well - known voice behind him exclaimed ,  - fatherdear father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man uttered a cry , and turned round; then , seeing his son , he fell into his arms , pale and trembling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what ails you , my dearest father? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you ill? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , my dear edmondmy boymy son! no; but i did not expect you; and joy , the surprise of seeing you so suddenlyah , i feel as if i were going to die . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the old man nodded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs , muttered edmond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - heaven pardon me , cried edmond , falling on his knees before his father . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - gently , gently , said the old man , with a smile;  - and by your leave i will use your purse moderately , for they would say , if they saw me buy too many things at a time , that i had been obliged to await your return , in order to be able to purchase them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do as you please; but , first of all , pray have a servant , father . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - his wife! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - why should i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is more important than you think , perhaps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you do not like dants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then tell me all you know about the catalane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know nothing for certain; only i have seen things which induce me to believe , as i told you , that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the vieilles infirmeries . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what have you seen? come , tell me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you say that dants has gone to the catalans? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he went before i came down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us go the same way; we will stop at la rserve , and we can drink a glass of la malgue , whilst we wait for news . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come along , said caderousse;  - but you pay the score . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beyond a bare , weather - worn wall , about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine , was the village of the catalans . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this village , constructed in a singular and picturesque manner , half moorish , half spanish , still remains , and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers , who speak the language of their fathers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village , and enter with us one of the houses , which is sunburned to the beautiful dead - leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country , and within coated with whitewash , like a spanish posada . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at three paces from her , seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs , leaning his elbow on an old worm - eaten table , was a tall young man of twenty , or two - and - twenty , who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he questioned her with his eyes , but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see , mercds , said the young man ,  - here is easter come round again; tell me , is this the moment for a wedding? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have answered you a hundred times , fernand , and really you must be very stupid to ask me again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , repeat it ,repeat it , i beg of you , that i may at last believe it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love , which had your mother s sanction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness , that my life or death are nothing to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband , mercds , and to lose that hope , which was the only stay of my existence! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have always said to you , i love you as a brother; but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection , for my heart is another s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you mistake , fernand; it is not a law , but merely a custom , and , i pray of you , do not cite this custom in your favor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once a soldier , what would you do with me , a poor orphan , forlorn , without fortune , with nothing but a half - ruined hut and a few ragged nets , the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother , and by my mother to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes you pretend i am useful to you , and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing , and i accept it , fernand , because you are the son of my father s brother , because we were brought up together , and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fernand , answered mercds , shaking her head ,  - a woman becomes a bad manager , and who shall say she will remain an honest woman , when she loves another man better than her husband? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , mercds , beloved by you , i would tempt fortune; you would bring me good luck , and i should become rich . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could extend my occupation as a fisherman , might get a place as clerk in a warehouse , and become in time a dealer myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you could do no such thing , fernand; you are a soldier , and if you remain at the catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a fisherman , and contented with my friendship , as i cannot give you more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would not that dress please you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked mercds , with an angry glance , - what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not understand you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i mean , mercds , that you are thus harsh and cruel with me , because you are expecting someone who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant , or if he is not , the sea is so to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fernand , cried mercds ,  - i believed you were good - hearted , and i was mistaken! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand , you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl made a gesture of rage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what end would that answer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to lose you my friendship if he were conquered , and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unable to have me for your wife , you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister; and besides , she added , her eyes troubled and moistened with tears ,  - wait , wait , fernand; you said just now that the sea was treacherous , and he has been gone four months , and during these four months there have been some terrible storms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand made no reply , nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of mercds , although for each of these tears he would have shed his heart s blood; but these tears flowed for another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he arose , paced a while up and down the hut , and then , suddenly stopping before mercds , with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched , - say , mercds , he said ,  - once for all , is this your final determination? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand let fall his head like a defeated man , heaved a sigh that was like a groan , and then suddenly looking her full in the face , with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils , said , - but if he is dead<s> <s>  - if he is dead , i shall die too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> called a joyous voice from without , - mercds! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , exclaimed the young girl , blushing with delight , and fairly leaping in excess of love ,  - you see he has not forgotten me , for here he is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand , pale and trembling , drew back , like a traveller at the sight of a serpent , and fell into a chair beside him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond and mercds were clasped in each other s arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the burning marseilles sun , which shot into the room through the open door , covered them with a flood of light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at first they saw nothing around them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world , and they only spoke in broken words , which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly edmond saw the gloomy , pale , and threatening countenance of fernand , as it was defined in the shadow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself , the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , your pardon , said dants , frowning in his turn;  - i did not perceive that there were three of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , turning to mercds , he inquired ,  - who is this gentleman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one who will be your best friend , dants , for he is my friend , my cousin , my brother; it is fernandthe man whom , after you , edmond , i love the best in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you not remember him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said dants , and without relinquishing mercds  hand clasped in one of his own , he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but fernand , instead of responding to this amiable gesture , remained mute and trembling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed mercds , and then again on the gloomy and menacing fernand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this look told him all , and his anger waxed hot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did not know , when i came with such haste to you , that i was to meet an enemy here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an enemy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried mercds , with an angry look at her cousin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an enemy in my house , do you say , edmond! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i believed that , i would place my arm under yours and go with you to marseilles , leaving the house to return to it no more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand s eye darted lightning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and should any misfortune occur to you , dear edmond , she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought ,  - if misfortune should occur to you , i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand became deadly pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have no enemy herethere is no one but fernand , my brother , who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan , who , as if fascinated by it , came slowly towards edmond , and offered him his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his hatred , like a powerless though furious wave , was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercds exercised over him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely , however , had he touched edmond s hand when he felt he had done all he could do , and rushed hastily out of the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , he exclaimed , running furiously and tearing his hair - oh , who will deliver me from this man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hallo , catalan! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hallo , fernand! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where are you running to? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed a voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man stopped suddenly , looked around him , and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars , under an arbor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said caderousse ,  - why don t you come? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he seems besotted , said danglars , pushing caderousse with his knee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are we mistaken , and is dants triumphant in spite of all we have believed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , we must inquire into that , was caderousse s reply; and turning towards the young man , said ,  - well , catalan , can t you make up your mind? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow , and slowly entered the arbor , whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses , and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - day , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you called me , didn t you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i called you because you were running like a madman , and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea , said caderousse , laughing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , when a man has friends , they are not only to offer him a glass of wine , but , moreover , to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand gave a groan , which resembled a sob , and dropped his head into his hands , his elbows leaning on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , fernand , i must say , said caderousse , beginning the conversation , with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy ,  - you look uncommonly like a rejected lover; and he burst into a hoarse laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are laughing at him , caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , come , fernand , said caderousse ,  - hold up your head , and answer us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it s not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my health is well enough , said fernand , clenching his hands without raising his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , you see , danglars , said caderousse , winking at his friend ,  - this is how it is; fernand , whom you see here , is a good and brave catalan , one of the best fishermen in marseilles , and he is in love with a very fine girl , named mercds; but it appears , unfortunately , that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the pharaon; and as the pharaon arrived todaywhy , you understand! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; i do not understand , said danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor fernand has been dismissed , continued caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , and what then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fernand , lifting up his head , and looking at caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger;  - mercds is not accountable to any person , is she? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is she not free to love whomsoever she will? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i thought you were a catalan , and they told me the catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was even told me that fernand , especially , was terrible in his vengeance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand smiled piteously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a lover is never terrible , he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor fellow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> remarked danglars , affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , you see , he did not expect to see dants return so suddenlyhe thought he was dead , perhaps; or perchance faithless! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , ma foi , under any circumstances! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse , who drank as he spoke , and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect , - under any circumstances fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of dants; is he , danglars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , you are rightand i should say that would bring him ill - luck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , never mind , answered caderousse , pouring out a glass of wine for fernand , and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time , while danglars had merely sipped his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never mindin the meantime he marries mercdsthe lovely mercdsat least he returns to do that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man , on whose heart caderousse s words fell like molten lead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and when is the wedding to be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured fernand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack , and turned to caderousse , whose countenance he scrutinized , to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said he , filling the glasses ,  - let us drink to captain edmond dants , husband of the beautiful catalane! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand , and swallowed the contents at a gulp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand dashed his on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stammered caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do i see down there by the wall , in the direction of the catalans? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look , fernand , your eyes are better than mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i believe i see double . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know wine is a deceiver; but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side , and hand in hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know them , fernand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , was the reply , in a low voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is edmond and mercds! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , see there , now! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse;  - and i did not recognize them! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hallo , dants! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hello , lovely damsel! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come this way , and let us know when the wedding is to be , for fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars , pretending to restrain caderousse , who , with the tenacity of drunkards , leaned out of the arbor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand , probably excited beyond bearing , pricked by danglars , as the bull is by the bandilleros , was about to rush out; for he had risen from his seat , and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival , when mercds , smiling and graceful , lifted up her lovely head , and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died , and dropped again heavily on his seat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here s an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath , and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet this catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful spaniards , sicilians , and calabrians , and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unquestionably , edmond s star is in the ascendant , and he will marry the splendid girlhe will be captain , too , and laugh at us all , unlessa sinister smile passed over danglars  lips - unless i take a hand in the affair , he added . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hallo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continued caderousse , half - rising , and with his fist on the table ,  - hallo , edmond! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , my dear fellow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied dants ,  - i am not proud , but i am happy , and happiness blinds , i think , more than pride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , very well , that s an explanation! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how do you do , madame dants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds courtesied gravely , and said - that is not my name , and in my country it bodes ill fortune , they say , to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we must excuse our worthy neighbor , caderousse , said dants ,  - he is so easily mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , then , the wedding is to take place immediately , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants , said danglars , bowing to the young couple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as soon as possible , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars; today all preliminaries will be arranged at my father s , and tomorrow , or next day at latest , the wedding festival here at la rserve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my friends will be there , i hope; that is to say , you are invited , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , and you , caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and fernand , said caderousse with a chuckle;  - fernand , too , is invited! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my wife s brother is my brother , said edmond;  - and we , mercds and i , should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand opened his mouth to reply , but his voice died on his lips , and he could not utter a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - today the preliminaries , tomorrow or next day the ceremony! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your pardon , replied danglars ,  - i merely said you seemed in a hurry , and we have lots of time; the pharaon cannot be under weigh again in less than three months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars; for when we have suffered a long time , we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; i must go to paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , really? to paris! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and will it be the first time you have ever been there , dants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you business there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , i shall only take the time to go and return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah; dants , my friend , you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship pharaon; then turning towards edmond , who was walking away ,  - a pleasant journey , he cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , my dear sir , said danglars to fernand ,  - here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it drives me to despair , said fernand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you , then , love mercds? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for long? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as long as i have known heralways . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you sit there , tearing your hair , instead of seeking to remedy your condition; i did not think that was the way of your people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what would you have me do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fernand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how do i know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it my affair? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have found already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> women say those things , but never do them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - idiot! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - before mercds should die , replied fernand , with the accents of unshaken resolution ,  - i would die myself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s what i call love! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s love , or i don t know what love is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear fellow , replied danglars ,  - you are three parts drunk; finish the bottle , and you will be completely so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> drink then , and do not meddle with what we are discussing , for that requires all one s wit and cool judgment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - idrunk! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse;  - well that s a good one! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could drink four more such bottles; they are no bigger than cologne flasks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pre pamphile , more wine! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and caderousse rattled his glass upon the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what was i saying? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this drunken caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - drunk , if you like; so much the worse for those who fear wine , for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts; and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tous les mchants sont buveurs d eau; c est bien prouv par le dluge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - death alone can separate them , remarked fernand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you talk like a noodle , my friend , said caderousse;  - and here is danglars , who is a wide - awake , clever , deep fellow , who will prove to you that you are wrong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have answered for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants is a good fellow; i like dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants , your health . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let him run on , said danglars , restraining the young man;  - drunk as he is , he is not much out in what he says . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but one gets out of prison , said caderousse , who , with what sense was left him , listened eagerly to the conversation ,  - and when one gets out and one s name is edmond dants , one seeks revenge<s> <s>  - what matters that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and why , i should like to know , persisted caderousse ,  - should they put dants in prison? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hold your tongue! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied caderousse;  - i say i want to know why they should put dants in prison; i like dants; dants , your health! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he swallowed another glass of wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication , and turning towards fernand , said ,  - well , you understand there is no need to kill him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is to be found for the searching . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know not why you meddle , said fernand , seizing his arm;  - but this i know , you have some motive of personal hatred against dants , for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> none , on my word! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw you were unhappy , and your unhappiness interested me; that s all; but since you believe i act for my own account , adieu , my dear friend , get out of the affair as best you may; and danglars rose as if he meant to depart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , said fernand , restraining him ,  - stay! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hate him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i confess it openly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you find the means , i will execute it , provided it is not to kill the man , for mercds has declared she will kill herself if dants is killed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who talks of killing dants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he s my friend , and this morning offered to share his money with me , as i shared mine with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i won t have dants killedi won t! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who has said a word about killing him , muddlehead? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , dants  good health! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his healthhurrah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but the meansthe means? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fernand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you not hit upon any? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no! you undertook to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , replied danglars;  - the french have the superiority over the spaniards , that the spaniards ruminate , while the french invent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - waiter , said danglars ,  - pen , ink , and paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; i am a supercargo; pen , ink , and paper are my tools , and without my tools i am fit for nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there s what you want on that table , said the waiter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the waiter did as he was desired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the catalan watched him until caderousse , almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses , rested , or rather dropped , his glass upon the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> resumed the catalan , as he saw the final glimmer of caderousse s reason vanishing before the last glass of wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , i should say , for instance , resumed danglars ,  - that if after a voyage such as dants has just made , in which he touched at the island of elba , someone were to denounce him to the king s procureur as a bonapartist agent<s> <s>  - i will denounce him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the young man hastily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , but they will make you then sign your declaration , and confront you with him you have denounced; i will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation , for i know the fact well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but dants cannot remain forever in prison , and one day or other he will leave it , and the day when he comes out , woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , and mercds! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds , who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved edmond! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fernand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and danglars , uniting practice with theory , wrote with his left hand , and in a writing reversed from his usual style , and totally unlike it , the following lines , which he handed to fernand , and which fernand read in an undertone: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> proof of this crime will be found on arresting him , for the letter will be found upon him , or at his father s , or in his cabin on board the pharaon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very good , resumed danglars;  - now your revenge looks like common sense , for in no way can it revert to yourself , and the matter will thus work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing , and write upon it , to the king s attorney ,  and that s all settled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed caderousse , who , by a last effort of intellect , had followed the reading of the letter , and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and taking the letter , he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all right! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> certainly neither i nor fernand , said danglars , rising and looking at the young man , who still remained seated , but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in this case , replied caderousse ,  - let s have some more wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wish to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse , rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man ,  - i can t keep on my legs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars ,  - i ll take your bet; but tomorrowtoday it is time to return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give me your arm , and let us go . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you will not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , just as you like , my prince; there s liberty for all the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had advanced about twenty yards , danglars looked back and saw fernand stoop , pick up the crumpled paper , and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards pillon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said caderousse ,  - why , what a lie he told! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hallo , fernand! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are coming , my boy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you don t see straight , said danglars;  - he s gone right by the road to the vieilles infirmeries . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the morning s sun rose clear and resplendent , touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby - tinted light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the feast had been made ready on the second floor at la rserve , with whose arbor the reader is already familiar . </s> </s>

<s> <s> morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon , who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship; and as dants was universally beloved on board his vessel , the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the entrance of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation , and to beseech him to make haste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them , composed of the betrothed pair , a party of young girls in attendance on the bride , by whose side walked dants  father; the whole brought up by fernand , whose lips wore their usual sinister smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> neither mercds nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having acquitted themselves of their errand , and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with edmond , danglars and caderousse took their places beside fernand and old dants ,the latter of whom attracted universal notice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk , trimmed with steel buttons , beautifully cut and polished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings , evidently of english manufacture , while from his three - cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beside him glided caderousse , whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dants , father and son , although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as danglars approached the disappointed lover , he cast on him a look of deep meaning , while fernand , as he slowly paced behind the happy pair , who seemed , in their own unmixed content , to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed , was pale and abstracted; occasionally , however , a deep flush would overspread his countenance , and a nervous contraction distort his features , while , with an agitated and restless gaze , he would glance in the direction of marseilles , like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants himself was simply , but becomingly , clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant servicea costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb; and with his fine countenance , radiant with joy and happiness , a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil , or , at least , have cast down her thickly fringed lashes , so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes; but , on the contrary , the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say:  - if you are my friends , rejoice with me , for i am very happy . </s> </s>

<s> <s> morrel , who , forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared , was gayly followed by the guests , beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father , said mercds , stopping when she had reached the centre of the table ,  - sit , i pray you , on my right hand; on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me , pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him , for his lips became ghastly pale , and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel was seated at his right hand , danglars at his left; while , at a sign from edmond , the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the delicacies , in fact , that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach , and styled by the grateful fishermen  - fruits of the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the old father of the bridegroom , as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz , and which had just been placed before mercds herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , would anybody think that this room contained a happy , merry party , who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the truth is , replied dants ,  - that i am too happy for noisy mirth; if that is what you meant by your observation , my worthy friend , you are right; joy takes a strange effect at times , it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars looked towards fernand , whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you fear any approaching evil? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that is the very thing that alarms me , returned dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood , where fierce , fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of all shapes and kinds , requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthythat of being the husband of mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , nay! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds is not yet your wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just assume the tone and manner of a husband , and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bride blushed , while fernand , restless and uneasy , seemed to start at every fresh sound , and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in an hour? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired danglars , turning pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how is that , my friend? </s> </s>

<s> <s> now , as a quarter - past one has already struck , i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying , that , in another hour and thirty minutes mercds will have become madame dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand closed his eyes , a burning sensation passed across his brow , and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair; but in spite of all his efforts , he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan , which , however , was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , cried the old man ,  - you make short work of this kind of affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the contract , answered dants , laughingly ,  - it didn t take long to fix that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , you see , our papers were quickly written out , and certainly do not come very expensive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this joke elicited a fresh burst of applause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , answered dants;  - don t imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree , that the elder dants , who , at the commencement of the repast , had commented upon the silence that prevailed , now found it difficult , amid the general din of voices , to obtain a moment s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants , perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father , responded by a look of grateful pleasure; while mercds glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously , and sought out more agreeable companions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everybody talked at once , without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for fernand himself , he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned; unable to rest , he was among the first to quit the table , and , as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds , he continued , in utter silence , to pace the farther end of the salon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , said caderousse , from whose mind the friendly treatment of dants , united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of , had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dants  good fortune , - upon my word , dants is a downright good fellow , and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , there was no harm meant , answered danglars;  - at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do; but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings , even so far as to become one of his rival s attendants , i knew there was no further cause for apprehension . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse looked full at fernandhe was ghastly pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , continued danglars ,  - the sacrifice was no trifling one , when the beauty of the bride is concerned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gad! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall we not set forth? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to be sure! to be sure! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried dants , eagerly quitting the table;  - let us go directly! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his words were re - echoed by the whole party , with vociferous cheers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment danglars , who had been incessantly observing every change in fernand s look and manner , saw him stagger and fall back , with an almost convulsive spasm , against a seat placed near one of the open windows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs , followed by the measured tread of soldiery , with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz as of many voices , so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party , among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk , and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three blows were struck upon the panel of the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i demand admittance , said a loud voice outside the room ,  - in the name of the law! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , addressing the magistrate , whom he evidently knew;  - there is doubtless some mistake easily explained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if it be so , replied the magistrate ,  - rely upon every reparation being made; meanwhile , i am the bearer of an order of arrest , and although i most reluctantly perform the task assigned me , it must , nevertheless , be fulfilled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every eye was turned towards the young man who , spite of the agitation he could not but feel , advanced with dignity , and said , in a firm voice: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - edmond dants , replied the magistrate ,  - i arrest you in the name of the law! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i cannot inform you , but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law , and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf , as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> old dants , however , sprang forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving , that even the officer was touched , and , although firm in his duty , he kindly said ,  - my worthy friend , let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo , and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required , whether touching the health of his crew , or the value of his freight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied he;  - i am , like yourself , utterly bewildered at all that is going on , and cannot in the least make out what it is about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse then looked around for fernand , but he had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , so , said he , in a hoarse and choking voice , to danglars ,  - this , then , i suppose , is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nonsense , returned danglars ,  - i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it; besides , you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> answered caderousse ,  - you merely threw it byi saw it lying in a corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where is fernand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how do i know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never mind where he is , let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , to be sure! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> responded danglars , who had now approached the group ,  - nothing more than a mistake , i feel quite certain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a carriage awaited him at the door; he got in , followed by two soldiers and the magistrate , and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried mercds , stretching out her arms to him from the balcony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prisoner heard the cry , which sounded like the sob of a broken heart , and leaning from the coach he called out ,  - good - bye , mercdswe shall soon meet again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait for me here , all of you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel;  - i will take the first conveyance i find , and hurry to marseilles , whence i will bring you word how all is going on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed a multitude of voices ,  - go , and return as quickly as you can! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile fernand made his appearance , poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it , went to sit down at the first vacant place , and this was , by mere chance , placed next to the seat on which poor mercds had fallen half fainting , when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instinctively fernand drew back his chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is the cause of all this miseryi am quite sure of it , whispered caderousse , who had never taken his eyes off fernand , to danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t think so , answered the other;  - he s too stupid to imagine such a scheme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you don t mention those who aided and abetted the deed , said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - surely , answered danglars ,  - one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you can , indeed , when the arrow lights point downward on somebody s head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what think you , danglars , said one of the party , turning towards him ,  - of this event? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , replied he ,  - i think it just possible dants may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but how could he have done so without your knowledge , danglars , since you are the ship s supercargo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , as for that , i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now i recollect , said the afflicted old father;  - my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee , and another of tobacco for me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , you see , exclaimed danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds , however , paid no heed to this explanation of her lover s arrest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her grief , which she had hitherto tried to restrain , now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , come , said the old man ,  - be comforted , my poor child; there is still hope! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hope! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faintly murmured fernand , but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips , and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good news! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what news? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sobbed forth mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that i believe! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> answered m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel;  - but still he is charged<s> <s>  - with what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a despairing cry escaped the pale lips of mercds; the old man sank into a chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , danglars! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am determined to tell them all about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be silent , you simpleton! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried danglars , grasping him by the arm ,  - or i will not answer even for your own safety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who can tell whether dants be innocent or guilty? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him , will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the rapid instinct of selfishness , caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed , doubtfully , wistfully , on danglars , and then caution supplanted generosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - suppose we wait a while , and see what comes of it , said he , casting a bewildered look on his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to be sure! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> answered danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us wait , by all means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he be innocent , of course he will be set at liberty; if guilty , why , it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot stay here any longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with all my heart! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied danglars , pleased to find the other so tractable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us take ourselves out of the way , and leave things for the present to take their course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after their departure , fernand , who had now again become the friend and protector of mercds , led the girl to her home , while some friends of dants conducted his father , nearly lifeless , to the alles de meilhan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - could you ever have credited such a thing , my dear danglars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , as , on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of dants , from m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , the assistant procureur , he overtook his supercargo and caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , you know i told you , replied danglars ,  - that i considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the island of elba as a very suspicious circumstance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly not! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> returned danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> policar morrel , who served under the other government , and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject , you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself , had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am too well aware that though a subordinate , like myself , is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs , there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are a worthy fellow; and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the pharaon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , indeed; i had previously inquired of dants what was his opinion of you , and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post , for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what was his reply? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars , but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship s owners would have his preference also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor dants! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no one can deny his being a noble - hearted young fellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but meanwhile , continued m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel ,  - here is the pharaon without a captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , replied danglars ,  - since we cannot leave this port for the next three months , let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dants will be set at liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , answered danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services , that upon edmond s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dants and myself each to resume our respective posts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel; but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will let you know that directly i have seen m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmond s favor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am aware he is a furious royalist; but , in spite of that , and of his being king s attorney , he is a man like ourselves , and i fancy not a bad sort of one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps not , replied danglars;  - but i hear that he is ambitious , and that s rather against him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well , returned m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now hasten on board , i will join you there ere long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see , said danglars , addressing caderousse ,  - the turn things have taken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not the slightest , but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> neither you nor myself , but fernand; you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the roomindeed , i fancied i had destroyed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , replied caderousse ,  - that i can answer for , you did not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now i think of it , by heavens , he may have sent the letter itself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fortunately , for me , the handwriting was disguised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you were aware of dants being engaged in a conspiracy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not i . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as i before said , i thought the whole thing was a joke , nothing more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seems , however , that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will see , danglars , that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nonsense! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can we be implicated in any way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all we have got to do is , to keep our own counsel , and remain perfectly quiet , not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> responded caderousse , waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars , and bending his steps towards the alles de meilhan , moving his head to and fro , and muttering as he went , after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so far , then , said danglars , mentally ,  - all has gone as i would have it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am , temporarily , commander of the pharaon , with the certainty of being permanently so , if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my only fear is the chance of dants being released . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , he leaped into a boat , desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon , where m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel had agreed to meet him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in one of the aristocratic mansions built by puget in the rue du grand cours opposite the medusa fountain , a second marriage feast was being celebrated , almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of a rude mixture of sailors , soldiers , and those belonging to the humblest grade of life , the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society ,magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper s reign; officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with cond; and younger members of families , brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr , and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the guests were still at table , and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south , where unhappily , for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the emperor , now king of the petty island of elba , after having held sovereign sway over one - half of the world , counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls ,after having been accustomed to hear the  - vive napolons of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings , uttered in ten different languages ,was looked upon here as a ruined man , separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her throne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic , while the women commented on the divorce of josephine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not over the downfall of the man , but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea , that they rejoiced , and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an old man , decorated with the cross of saint louis , now rose and proposed the health of king louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the marquis de saint - mran . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this toast , recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace - loving king of france , excited universal enthusiasm; glasses were elevated in the air  l anglaise , and the ladies , snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms , strewed the table with their floral treasures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a word , an almost poetical fervor prevailed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said the marquise de saint - mran , a woman with a stern , forbidding eye , though still noble and distinguished in appearance , despite her fifty years - ah , these revolutionists , who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror , would be compelled to own , were they here , that all true devotion was on our side , since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch , while they , on the contrary , made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun; yes , yes , they could not help admitting that the king , for whom we sacrificed rank , wealth , and station was truly our louis the well - beloved ,  while their wretched usurper has been , and ever will be , to them their evil genius , their napoleon the accursed . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i forgive you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what i was saying , villefort , was , that the bonapartists had not our sincerity , enthusiasm , or devotion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they had , however , what supplied the place of those fine qualities , replied the young man ,  - and that was fanaticism . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> napoleon is the mahomet of the west , and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers , not only as a leader and lawgiver , but also as the personification of equality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for mercy s sake , then , what would you call robespierre? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , come , do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the corsican , who , to my mind , has usurped quite enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , madame; i would place each of these heroes on his right pedestalthat of robespierre on his scaffold in the place louis quinze; that of napoleon on the column of the place vendme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men; one is the equality that elevates , the other is the equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine , the other elevates the people to a level with the throne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , marquise , it has been so with other usurperscromwell , for instance , who was not half so bad as napoleon , had his partisans and advocates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i excuse it , it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a deep crimson suffused the countenance of villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  tis true , madame , answered he ,  - that my father was a girondin , but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror , and had well - nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , replied the marquise , without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up;  - but bear in mind , if you please , that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which i may remark , that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes , your father lost no time in joining the new government; and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin , the count noirtier became a senator . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - suffer me , also , madame , replied villefort ,  - to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint - mran s , that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for my own part , i have laid aside even the name of my father , and altogether disown his political principles . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but bear in mind , that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government , you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment , as it is known you belong to a suspected family . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but we have not done with the thing yet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you , indeed , think so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the marquise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am , at least , fearful of it . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as villefort observes , it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica , where he was born , and naples , of which his brother - in - law is king , and face to face with italy , the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unfortunately , said villefort ,  - there are the treaties of 1814 , and we cannot molest napoleon without breaking those compacts . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - unfortunately , madame , answered villefort ,  - the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - do you know , my dear villefort , cried the comte de salvieux ,  - that is exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries , when questioned by his majesty s principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a girondin and the daughter of an officer of the duc de cond; and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i should myself have recommended the match , had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid , he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him , when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is right , cried the marquise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i love to see you thus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , then , were a conspirator to fall into your hands , he would be most welcome . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat , and leaning over her chair said tenderly: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to give you pleasure , my sweet rene , i promise to show all the lenity in my power; but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct , why , then , you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off . </s> </s>

<s> <s> no sooner had villefort left the salon , than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , in spite of the nobility of his countenance , the command of which , like a finished actor , he had carefully studied before the glass , it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns , and he had , besides , the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father s death . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you have it already , for it was taken from me with some others which i see in that packet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to monsieur noirtier , rue coq - hron , paris . </s> </s>

<s> <s> noirtier , rue coq - hron , no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 13 , murmured he , growing still paler . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied villefort;  - a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a conspiracy , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked dants , who after believing himself free , now began to feel a tenfold alarm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have , however , already told you , sir , i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed , said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you shown this letter to anyone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that was too much , far too much , murmured villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said dants timidly ,  - what is the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are illshall i ring for assistance? shall i call? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is for me to give orders here , and not you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur , replied dants proudly ,  - it was only to summon assistance for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i want none; it was a temporary indisposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> attend to yourself; answer me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort fell back on his chair , passed his hand over his brow , moist with perspiration , and , for the third time , read the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , if he knows the contents of this! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured he ,  - and that noirtier is the father of villefort , i am lost! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , it is impossible to doubt it , cried he , suddenly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in heaven s name! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort made a violent effort , and in a tone he strove to render firm: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , monsieur , cried dants ,  - you have been rather a friend than a judge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see , i destroy it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , exclaimed dants ,  - you are goodness itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , continued villefort;  - you can now have confidence in me after what i have done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , command , and i will obey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen; this is not a command , but advice i give you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see , continued he , glancing toward the grate , where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames ,  - the letter is destroyed; you and i alone know of its existence; should you , therefore , be questioned , deny all knowledge of itdeny it boldly , and you are saved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be satisfied; i will deny it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was the only letter you had? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - swear it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort rang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a police agent entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - follow him , said villefort to dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants saluted villefort and retired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hardly had the door closed when villefort threw himself half - fainting into a chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , my father , must your past career always interfere with my successes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly a light passed over his face , a smile played round his set mouth , and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this will do , said he ,  - and from this letter , which might have ruined me , i will make my fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the commissary of police , as he traversed the antechamber , made a sign to two gendarmes , who placed themselves one on dants  right and the other on his left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after numberless windings , dants saw a door with an iron wicket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice , every blow seeming to dants as if struck on his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the air he inhaled was no longer pure , but thick and mephitic ,he was in prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was four o clock when dants was placed in this chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was , as we have said , the 1st of march , and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last , about ten o clock , and just as dants began to despair , steps were heard in the corridor , a key turned in the lock , the bolts creaked , the massy oaken door flew open , and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the torchlight dants saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had advanced at first , but stopped at the sight of this display of force . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the orders of the deputy procureur? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the conviction that they came from m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort relieved all dants  apprehensions; he advanced calmly , and placed himself in the centre of the escort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a carriage waited at the door , the coachman was on the box , and a police officer sat beside him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is this carriage for me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is for you , replied a gendarme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants was about to speak; but feeling himself urged forward , and having neither the power nor the intention to resist , he mounted the steps , and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes; the two others took their places opposite , and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prisoner glanced at the windowsthey were grated; he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> through the grating , however , dants saw they were passing through the rue caisserie , and by the rue saint - laurent and the rue taramis , to the quay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thought he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first , then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the soldiers looked at dants with an air of stupid curiosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in an instant he was placed in the stern - sheets of the boat , between the gendarmes , while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent the boat adrift , and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the pilon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at a shout from the boat , the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were , as dants knew , in the frioul and outside the inner harbor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants folded his hands , raised his eyes to heaven , and prayed fervently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this manuvre was incomprehensible to dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whither are you taking me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but still<s> <s>  - we are forbidden to give you any explanation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants , trained in discipline , knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates , who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boat they were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor; he thought , perhaps , they were going to leave him on some distant point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was not bound , nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him; this seemed a good augury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , had not the deputy , who had been so kind to him , told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier , he had nothing to apprehend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had not villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter , the only proof against him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he waited silently , striving to pierce through the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach , for it was there mercds dwelt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercds that her lover was within three hundred yards of her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one light alone was visible; and dants saw that it came from mercds  chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but pride restrained him and he did not utter it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained silent , his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on , but the prisoner thought only of mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an intervening elevation of land hid the light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants turned and perceived that they had got out to sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in spite of his repugnance to address the guards , dants turned to the nearest gendarme , and taking his hand ,<s> <s>  - comrade , said he ,  - i adjure you , as a christian and a soldier , to tell me where we are going . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am captain dants , a loyal frenchman , thought accused of treason; tell me where you are conducting me , and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion , who returned for answer a sign that said ,  - i see no great harm in telling him now , and the gendarme replied: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you no idea whatever? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i swear to you it is true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , i entreat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but my orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your orders do not forbid your telling me what i must know in ten minutes , in half an hour , or an hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see i cannot escape , even if i intended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unless you are blind , or have never been outside the harbor , you must know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants rose and looked forward , when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the chteau d if . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gendarme smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not going there to be imprisoned , said dants;  - it is only used for political prisoners . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have committed no crime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are there any magistrates or judges at the chteau d if? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there are only , said the gendarme ,  - a governor , a garrison , turnkeys , and good thick walls . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , come , do not look so astonished , or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants pressed the gendarme s hand as though he would crush it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you think , then , said he ,  - that i am taken to the chteau d if to be imprisoned there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - without any inquiry , without any formality? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and so , in spite of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know what m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort promised you , said the gendarme ,  - but i know we are taking you to the chteau d if . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> help , comrades , help! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by a rapid movement , which the gendarme s practiced eye had perceived , dants sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea; but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hark ye , my friend , i have disobeyed my first order , but i will not disobey the second; and if you move , i will blow your brains out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he levelled his carbine at dants , who felt the muzzle against his temple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind , and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained motionless , but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the sailors leaped on shore , a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley , and dants guessed they were at the end of the voyage , and that they were mooring the boat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his guards , taking him by the arms and coat - collar , forced him to rise , and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress , while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants made no resistance; he was like a man in a dream; he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment; he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps; he was conscious that he passed through a door , and that the door closed behind him; but all this indistinctly as through a mist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not even see the ocean , that terrible barrier against freedom , which the prisoners look upon with utter despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> certain dants could not escape , the gendarmes released him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they seemed awaiting orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the orders came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here , replied the gendarmes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let him follow me; i will take him to his cell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the gendarmes , thrusting dants forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prisoner followed his guide , who led him into a room almost under ground , whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly , and showed dants the features of his conductor , an under - jailer , ill - clothed , and of sullen appearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here is your chamber for tonight , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is late , and the governor is asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tomorrow , perhaps , he may change you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the meantime there is bread , water , and fresh straw; and that is all a prisoner can wish for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> goodnight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and before dants could open his mouthbefore he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the waterbefore he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was , the jailer disappeared , taking with him the lamp and closing the door , leaving stamped upon the prisoner s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants was alone in darkness and in silencecold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found the prisoner in the same position , as if fixed there , his eyes swollen with weeping . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he touched him on the shoulder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond started . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you not slept? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the jailer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jailer stared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continued he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wish to see the governor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants followed him with his eyes , and stretched forth his hands towards the open door; but the door closed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day passed thus; he scarcely tasted food , but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one thought in particular tormented him: namely , that during his journey hither he had sat so still , whereas he might , a dozen times , have plunged into the sea , and , thanks to his powers of swimming , for which he was famous , have gained the shore , concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel , escaped to spain or italy , where mercds and his father could have joined him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he spoke italian like a tuscan , and spanish like a castilian; he would have been free , and happy with mercds and his father , whereas he was now confined in the chteau d if , that impregnable fortress , ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercds; and all this because he had trusted to villefort s promise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thought was maddening , and dants threw himself furiously down on his straw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning at the same hour , the jailer came again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the jailer ,  - are you more reasonable today? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants made no reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , cheer up; is there anything that i can do for you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wish to see the governor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have already told you it was impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because it is against prison rules , and prisoners must not even ask for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is allowed , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - better fare , if you pay for it , books , and leave to walk about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not want books , i am satisfied with my food , and do not care to walk about; but i wish to see the governor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , said edmond ,  - if you do not , i shall die of hungerthat is all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die; and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer , he replied in a more subdued tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , asked dants ,  - how long shall i have to wait? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , a monthsix monthsa year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wish to see him at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you think so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how long has he left it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - two years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - was he liberated , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; he was put in a dungeon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not an abb , i am not mad; perhaps i shall be , but at present , unfortunately , i am not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not offer you a million , because i have it not; but i will give you a hundred crowns if , the first time you go to marseilles , you will seek out a young girl named mercds , at the catalans , and give her two lines from me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i took them , and were detected , i should lose my place , which is worth two thousand francs a year; so that i should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said dants ,  - mark this; if you refuse at least to tell mercds i am here , i will some day hide myself behind the door , and when you enter i will dash out your brains with this stool . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the jailer , retreating and putting himself on the defensive;  - you are certainly going mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb began like you , and in three days you will be like him , mad enough to tie up; but , fortunately , there are dungeons here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all right , all right , said the jailer;  - all right , since you will have it so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well , returned dants , dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jailer went out , and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the governor s orders , said he ,  - conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; we must put the madman with the madmen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the soldiers seized dants , who followed passively . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he descended fifteen steps , and the door of a dungeon was opened , and he was thrust in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door closed , and dants advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall; he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jailer was right; dants wanted but little of being utterly mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort had , as we have said , hastened back to madame de saint - mran s in the place du grand cours , and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rene was , with all the rest of the company , anxiously awaiting him , and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are we threatened with a fresh reign of terror? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried a third . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will the marquis honor me by a few moments  private conversation? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the marquis , remarking the cloud on villefort s brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so serious that i must take leave of you for a few days; so , added he , turning to rene ,  - judge for yourself if it be not important . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are going to leave us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where , then , are you going? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that , madame , is an official secret; but if you have any commissions for paris , a friend of mine is going there tonight , and will with pleasure undertake them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , let us go to the library , please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , asked he , as soon as they were by themselves ,  - tell me what it is? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an affair of the greatest importance , that demands my immediate presence in paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then sell outsell out , marquis , or you will lose it all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but how can i sell out here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have a broker , have you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then give me a letter to him , and tell him to sell out without an instant s delay , perhaps even now i shall arrive too late . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the deuce you say! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , sitting down , he wrote a letter to his broker , ordering him to sell out at the market price . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to the king . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to the king? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i dare not write to his majesty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not ask you to write to his majesty , but ask m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de salvieux to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but address yourself to the keeper of the seals; he has the right of entry at the tuileries , and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doubtless; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i tell you , marquis , my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first , for the king will not forget the service i do him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in that case go and get ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will call salvieux and make him write the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be as quick as possible , i must be on the road in a quarter of an hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell your coachman to stop at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will present my excuses to the marquise and mademoiselle rene , whom i leave on such a day with great regret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a thousand thanksand now for the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the marquis rang , a servant entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , then , go , said the marquis . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall be gone only a few moments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort hastily quitted the apartment , but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion , he resumed his ordinary pace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was mercds , who , hearing no news of her lover , had come unobserved to inquire after him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants had spoken of mercds , and villefort instantly recognized her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her beauty and high bearing surprised him , and when she inquired what had become of her lover , it seemed to him that she was the judge , and he the accused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds burst into tears , and , as villefort strove to pass her , again addressed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , at least , tell me where he is , that i may know whether he is alive or dead , said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and desirous of putting an end to the interview , he pushed by her , and closed the door , as if to exclude the pain he felt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but remorse is not thus banished; like virgil s wounded hero , he carried the arrow in his wound , and , arrived at the salon , villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob , and sank into a chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man he sacrificed to his ambition , that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father s faults , appeared to him pale and threatening , leading his affianced bride by the hand , and bringing with him remorse , not such as the ancients figured , furious and terrible , but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals , and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned , and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villefort s brow , because they were guilty; at least , he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he thus reflected , he felt the sensation we have described , and which had hitherto been unknown to him , arise in his bosom , and fill him with vague apprehensions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed , but villefort s was one of those that never close , or if they do , only close to reopen more agonizing than ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort rose , or rather sprang , from his chair , hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk , emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket , stood motionless an instant , his hand pressed to his head , muttered a few inarticulate sounds , and then , perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders , he sprang into the carriage , ordering the postilions to drive to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hapless dants was doomed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the marquis had promised , villefort found the marquise and rene in waiting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he started when he saw rene , for he fancied she was again about to plead for dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas , her emotions were wholly personal: she was thinking only of villefort s departure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she loved villefort , and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile what of mercds? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge; she had returned to the catalans , and had despairingly cast herself on her couch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lamp went out for want of oil , but she paid no heed to the darkness , and dawn came , but she knew not that it was day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grief had made her blind to all but one objectthat was edmond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have not quitted you since yesterday , returned fernand sorrowfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel had not readily given up the fight . </s> </s>

<s> <s> well , then , see , here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposala gentleman , only a simple magistrate , who learned more than you with all your police , and who would have saved my crown , if , like you , he had the power of directing a telegraph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort , who bent his head in modest triumph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not mean that for you , blacas , continued louis xviii . </s> </s>

<s> <s> any other person would , perhaps , have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise; but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister , although he saw that dandr was irrevocably lost . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - go on , go on , sir , replied the king;  - you have today earned the right to make inquiries here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sire , interposed the minister of police ,  - i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head , when your majesty s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf , and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty . </s> </s>

<s> <s> yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed , but he was lost sight of at the corner of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coq - hron . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - well , then , if you felt so sure , replied the new - comer , putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair ,  - allow me to say , my dear grard , that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the door . </s> </s>

<s> <s> noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door , then that of the bedchamber , and then extended his hand to villefort , who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , now , my dear grard , said he to the young man , with a very significant look ,  - do you know , you seem as if you were not very glad to see me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear father , said villefort ,  - i am , on the contrary , delighted; but i so little expected your visit , that it has somewhat overcome me . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - father , your coolness makes me shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , my dear boy , when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers , has escaped from paris in a hay - cart , been hunted over the plains of bordeaux by robespierre s bloodhounds , he becomes accustomed to most things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but go on , what about the club in the rue saint - jacques? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , they induced general quesnel to go there , and general quesnel , who quitted his own house at nine o clock in the evening , was found the next day in the seine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the king himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , in return for your story , continued noirtier ,  - i will tell you another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear father , i think i already know what you are about to tell me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , you have heard of the landing of the emperor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not so loud , father , i entreat of youfor your own sake as well as mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are crazy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , three days ago the emperor had not landed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by a letter addressed to you from the island of elba . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to you; and which i discovered in the pocket - book of the messenger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had that letter fallen into the hands of another , you , my dear father , would probably ere this have been shot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort s father laughed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , come , said he ,  - will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what an idea! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where is the letter you speak of? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i burnt it , for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that letter must have led to your condemnation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and the destruction of your future prospects , replied noirtier;  - yes , i can easily comprehend that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do better than that , siri save you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , really , the thing becomes more and more dramaticexplain yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must refer again to the club in the rue saint - jacques . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why didn t they search more vigilantly? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they would have found<s> <s>  - they have not found; but they are on the track . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , that the usual phrase; i am quite familiar with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , but they have found a corpse; the general has been killed , and in all countries they call that a murder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> people are found every day in the seine , having thrown themselves in , or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father , you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair , and people do not bathe in the seine in the month of january . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , no , do not be deceived; this was murder in every sense of the word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who thus designated it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the king himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in politics , my dear fellow , you know , as well as i do , there are no men , but ideasno feelings , but interests; in politics we do not kill a man , we only remove an obstacle , that is all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would you like to know how matters have progressed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , i will tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he came there , and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba , the projected landing , etc . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet he did not return home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what could that mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , my dear fellow , that on leaving us he lost his way , that s all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a murder? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> really , villefort , you surprise me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - but , father , take care; when our turn comes , our revenge will be sweeping . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not understand you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are mistaken; he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed , tracked , and caught like a wild beast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear fellow , the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble; on the 10th or 12th he will be at lyons , and on the 20th or 25th at paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , to go and meet him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has but a handful of men with him , and armies will be despatched against him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , to escort him into the capital . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> really , my dear grard , you are but a child; you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you , three days after the landing , the usurper has landed at cannes with several men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is pursued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but where is he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is he doing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - grenoble and lyons are faithful cities , and will oppose to him an impassable barrier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasmall lyons will hasten to welcome him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would you like a proof of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , you wished to conceal your journey from me , and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ring , then , if you please , for a second knife , fork , and plate , and we will dine together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied villefort , looking at his father with astonishment ,  - you really do seem very well informed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said villefort , with a sneer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , devotion; for that is , i believe , the phrase for hopeful ambition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and villefort s father extended his hand to the bell - rope , to summon the servant whom his son had not called . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort caught his arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - say on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , the admirable police have found that out , have they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what may be that description? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , ha , that s it , is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said noirtier;  - and why , then , have they not laid hands on him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - didn t i say that your police were good for nothing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , said noirtier , looking carelessly around him ,  - true , if this person were not on his guard , as he is; and he added with a smile ,  - he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at these words he rose , and put off his frock - coat and cravat , went towards a table on which lay his son s toilet articles , lathered his face , took a razor , and , with a firm hand , cut off the compromising whiskers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his whiskers cut off , noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took , instead of his black cravat , a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau; put on , in lieu of his blue and high - buttoned frock - coat , a coat of villefort s of dark brown , and cut away in front; tried on before the glass a narrow - brimmed hat of his son s , which appeared to fit him perfectly , and , leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it , he took up a small bamboo switch , cut the air with it once or twice , and walked about with that easy swagger which was one of his principal characteristics . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , father , stammered villefort;  - at least , i hope not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now , my dear boy , continued noirtier ,  - i rely on your prudence to remove all the things which i leave in your care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are not convinced yet? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall you see the king again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - would you pass in his eyes for a prophet? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - prophets of evil are not in favor at the court , father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , but some day they do them justice; and supposing a second restoration , you would then pass for a great man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , what should i say to the king? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - say this to him: sire , you are deceived as to the feeling in france , as to the opinions of the towns , and the prejudices of the army; he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre , who at nevers is styled the usurper , is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons , and emperor at grenoble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you think he is tracked , pursued , captured; he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger , worn out with fatigue , ready to desert , gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  tell him this , grard; or , rather , tell him nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you have come to paris to do , or have done; return with all speed; enter marseilles at night , and your house by the back - door , and there remain , quiet , submissive , secret , and , above all , inoffensive; for this time , i swear to you , we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go , my songo , my dear grard , and by your obedience to my paternal orders , or , if you prefer it , friendly counsels , we will keep you in your place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this will be , added noirtier , with a smile ,  - one means by which you may a second time save me , if the political balance should some day take another turn , and cast you aloft while hurling me down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , pale and agitated , ran to the window , put aside the curtain , and saw him pass , cool and collected , by two or three ill - looking men at the corner of the street , who were there , perhaps , to arrest a man with black whiskers , and a blue frock - coat , and hat with broad brim . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort stood watching , breathless , until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him , put the black cravat and blue frock - coat at the bottom of the portmanteau , threw the hat into a dark closet , broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire , put on his travelling - cap , and calling his valet , checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask , paid his bill , sprang into his carriage , which was ready , learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble , and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road , at length reached marseilles , a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier was a true prophet , and things progressed rapidly , as he had predicted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba , a return which was unprecedented in the past , and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow; the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation , and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , therefore , gained nothing save the king s gratitude ( which was rather likely to injure him at the present time ) and the cross of the legion of honor , which he had the prudence not to wear , although m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all villefort s influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret dants had so nearly divulged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king s procureur alone was deprived of his office , being suspected of royalism . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , scarcely was the imperial power establishedthat is , scarcely had the emperor re - entered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers ,he found on the table there louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> s half - filled snuff - box ,scarcely had this occurred when marseilles began , in spite of the authorities , to rekindle the flames of civil war , always smouldering in the south , and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort retained his place , but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de saint - mran , like his own , could be vastly increased , and the marriage be still more suitable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the deputy procureur was , therefore , the first magistrate of marseilles , when one morning his door opened , and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel was announced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anyone else would have hastened to receive him; but villefort was a man of ability , and he knew this would be a sign of weakness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made morrel wait in the antechamber , although he had no one with him , for the simple reason that the king s procureur always makes everyone wait , and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers , he ordered m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel to be admitted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had entered villefort s office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him; on the contrary , he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk , and his head leaning on his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , i believe? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come nearer , said the magistrate , with a patronizing wave of the hand ,  - and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you not guess , monsieur? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - explain yourself , pray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur , said morrel , recovering his assurance as he proceeded ,  - do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor , i came to intercede for a young man , the mate of my ship , who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was the other day a crime is today a title to favor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you then served louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , and you did not show any favorit was your duty; today you serve napoleon , and you ought to protect himit is equally your duty; i come , therefore , to ask what has become of him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is his name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - edmond dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dants , repeated he ,  - edmond dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , monsieur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort opened a large register , then went to a table , from the table turned to his registers , and then , turning to morrel ,<s> <s>  - are you quite sure you are not mistaken , monsieur? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he , in the most natural tone in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort had calculated rightly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said morrel;  - i am not mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have known him for ten years , the last four of which he was in my service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not you recollect , i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency , as i come today to plead for justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you received me very coldly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur , returned villefort ,  - i was then a royalist , because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne , but the chosen of the nation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me , the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i like to hear you speak thus , and i augur well for edmond from it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait a moment , said villefort , turning over the leaves of a register;  - i have ita sailor , who was about to marry a young catalan girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i recollect now; it was a very serious charge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i made my report to the authorities at paris , and a week after he was carried off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - carried off! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what can they have done with him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come when he will , it shall be kept for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not be too hasty , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , replied villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the order of imprisonment came from high authority , and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source; and , as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight , the letters have not yet been forwarded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said morrel ,  - is there no way of expediting all these formalitiesof releasing him from arrest? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there has been no arrest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is sometimes essential to government to cause a man s disappearance without leaving any traces , so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself , and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had morrel even any suspicions , so much kindness would have dispelled them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - petition the minister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i know what that is; the minister receives two hundred petitions every day , and does not read three . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and will you undertake to deliver it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with the greatest pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry , which , however improbable it might be , if it did take place would leave him defenceless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but how shall i address the minister? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sit down there , said villefort , giving up his place to morrel ,  - and write what i dictate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but lose no time; we have lost too much already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants must be crushed to gratify villefort s ambition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the petition finished , villefort read it aloud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that will do , said he;  - leave the rest to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - today . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , sitting down , villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what more is to be done? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will do whatever is necessary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this assurance delighted morrel , who took leave of villefort , and hastened to announce to old dants that he would soon see his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants remained a prisoner , and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> s throne , or the still more tragic destruction of the empire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last there was waterloo , and morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power , and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> remounted the throne; villefort , to whom marseilles had become filled with remorseful memories , sought and obtained the situation of king s procureur at toulouse , and a fortnight afterwards he married mademoiselle de saint - mran , whose father now stood higher at court than ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so dants , after the hundred days and after waterloo , remained in his dungeon , forgotten of earth and heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dants; and , when napoleon returned to france , he , after the manner of mediocre minds , termed the coincidence , a decree of providence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when napoleon returned to paris , danglars  heart failed him , and he lived in constant fear of dants  return on a mission of vengeance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he therefore informed m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel of his wish to quit the sea , and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant , into whose service he entered at the end of march , that is , ten or twelve days after napoleon s return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then left for madrid , and was no more heard of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what had become of him he cared not to inquire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only , during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him , he reflected , partly on the means of deceiving mercds as to the cause of his absence , partly on plans of emigration and abduction , as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo , at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible , watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man , who was for him also the messenger of vengeance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand s mind was made up; he would shoot dants , and then kill himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never kills himself , for he constantly hopes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during this time the empire made its last conscription , and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand departed with the rest , bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away , his rival would perhaps return and marry mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had fernand really meant to kill himself , he would have done so when he parted from mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his devotion , and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes , produced the effect they always produce on noble mindsmercds had always had a sincere regard for fernand , and this was now strengthened by gratitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my brother , said she , as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders ,  - be careful of yourself , for if you are killed , i shall be alone in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these words carried a ray of hope into fernand s heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> should dants not return , mercds might one day be his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren , and the sea that had never seemed so vast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue , looking towards marseilles , at other times gazing on the sea , and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean , and thus end her woes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse was , like fernand , enrolled in the army , but , being married and eight years older , he was merely sent to the frontier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> old dants , who was only sustained by hope , lost all hope at napoleon s downfall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> five months after he had been separated from his son , and almost at the hour of his arrest , he breathed his last in mercds  arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the south was aflame , and to assist , even on his death - bed , the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dants , was stigmatized as a crime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a year after louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> s restoration , a visit was made by the inspector - general of prisons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants in his cell heard the noise of preparation ,sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner , who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living; but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world , that he looked upon himself as dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the inspector visited , one after another , the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners , whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he inquired how they were fed , and if they had any request to make . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the universal response was , that the fare was detestable , and that they wanted to be set free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they shook their heads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the inspector turned smilingly to the governor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits; when you see one prisoner , you see all ,always the same thing ,ill fed and innocent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are there any others? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us visit them , said the inspector with an air of fatigue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we must play the farce to the end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us see the dungeons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us first send for two soldiers , said the governor . </s> </s>

<s> <s> now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant , and to which you descend by another stair , an old abb , formerly leader of a party in italy , who has been here since 1811 , and in 1813 he went mad , and the change is astonishing . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - will you see the register at once , asked the governor ,  - or proceed to the other cell? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i once went up those stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , this one is not like the other , and his madness is less affecting than this one s display of reason . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i , monsieur , replied the abb with an air of surprise , - i want nothing . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - because i was arrested at piombino , and i presume that , like milan and florence , piombino has become the capital of some french department . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said the inspector ,  - you have not the latest news from italy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my information dates from the day on which i was arrested , returned the abb faria;  - and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son , i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and csar borgia , which was to make italy a united kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur , returned the inspector ,  - providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the food is the same as in other prisons ,that is , very bad; the lodging is very unhealthful , but , on the whole , passable for a dungeon; but it is not that which i wish to speak of , but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we are coming to the point , whispered the governor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is for that reason i am delighted to see you , continued the abb ,  - although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation , which , if it succeeded , would possibly change newton s system . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> could you allow me a few words in private . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what did i tell you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the governor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you knew him , returned the inspector with a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the very sum you named , whispered the inspector in his turn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unfortunately , said the governor ,  - i know beforehand what you are about to say; it concerns your treasures , does it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inspector , continued the governor ,  - i can tell you the story as well as he , for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear sir , the government is rich and does not want your treasures , replied the inspector;  - keep them until you are liberated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb s eyes glistened; he seized the inspector s hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had not government better profit by it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will offer six millions , and i will content myself with the rest , if they will only give me my liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on my word , said the inspector in a low tone ,  - had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad , i should believe what he says . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not mad , replied faria , with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the governor laughed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a hundred leagues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not ill - planned , said the governor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues , and their guardians consented to accompany them , they would have a capital chance of escaping . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the scheme is well known , said the inspector;  - and the abb s plan has not even the merit of originality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then turning to faria ,  - i inquired if you are well fed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated the inspector . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you do not reply to my question , replied the inspector impatiently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nor you to mine , cried the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will not accept my gold; i will keep it for myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you refuse me my liberty; god will give it me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the abb , casting away his coverlet , resumed his place , and continued his calculations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is he doing there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the inspector . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - counting his treasures , replied the governor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they went out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the turnkey closed the door behind them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he was wealthy once , perhaps? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the inspector . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - or dreamed he was , and awoke mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - after all , said the inspector ,  - if he had been rich , he would not have been here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caligula or nero , those treasure - seekers , those desirers of the impossible , would have accorded to the poor wretch , in exchange for his wealth , the liberty he so earnestly prayed for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the kings of modern times , restrained by the limits of mere probability , have neither courage nor desire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they fear the ear that hears their orders , and the eye that scrutinizes their actions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture , so madness is always concealed in its cell , from whence , should it depart , it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital , where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the inspector kept his word with dants; he examined the register , and found the following note concerning him: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond dants: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> violent bonapartist; took an active part in the return from elba . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the inspector could not contend against this accusation; he simply wrote , nothing to be done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this visit had infused new vigor into dants; he had , till then , forgotten the date; but now , with a fragment of plaster , he wrote the date , 30th july , 1816 , and made a mark every day , in order not to lose his reckoning again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> days and weeks passed away , then monthsdants still waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this fortnight expired , he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris , and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished , he therefore fixed three months; three months passed away , then six more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took with him several of his subordinates , and amongst them dants  jailer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a new governor arrived; it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners; he learned their numbers instead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this horrible place contained fifty cells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell , and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dantshe was now number 34 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own innocence , which justified in some measure the governor s belief in his mental alienation; and then , relaxing his sentiment of pride , he addressed his supplications , not to god , but to man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he entreated to be allowed to walk about , to have fresh air , books , and writing materials . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his requests were not granted , but he went on asking all the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer , although the latter was , if possible , more taciturn than the old one; but still , to speak to a man , even though mute , was something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice; he had tried to speak when alone , but the sound of his voice terrified him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the galley - slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven , and saw each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were very happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so; and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor; but the latter sapiently imagined that dants wished to conspire or attempt an escape , and refused his request . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he prayed , and prayed aloud , no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice , for he fell into a sort of ecstasy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he laid every action of his life before the almighty , proposed tasks to accomplish , and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to god:  - forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet in spite of his earnest prayers , dants remained a prisoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then gloom settled heavily upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants was a man of great simplicity of thought , and without education; he could not , therefore , in the solitude of his dungeon , traverse in mental vision the history of the ages , bring to life the nations that had perished , and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination , and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in martin s babylonian pictures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not do this , he whose past life was so short , whose present so melancholy , and his future so doubtful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no distraction could come to his aid; his energetic spirit , that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past , was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rage supplanted religious fervor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror , dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison , wreaked his anger upon everything , and chiefly upon himself , so that the least thing ,a grain of sand , a straw , or a breath of air that annoyed him , led to paroxysms of fury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind , and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene , mene , tekel upharsin of belshazzar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he told himself that it was the enmity of man , and not the vengeance of heaven , that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine , and found them all insufficient , because after torture came death , and after death , if not repose , at least the boon of unconsciousness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death , and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented , he began to reflect on suicide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye; but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss , at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond found some solace in these ideas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all his sorrows , all his sufferings , with their train of gloomy spectres , fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants reviewed his past life with composure , and , looking forward with terror to his future existence , chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge , that trembled and shook before the tempest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death , and death then terrified me , and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i did so because i was happy , because i had not courted death , because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible , because i was unwilling that i , a creature made for the service of god , should serve for food to the gulls and ravens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now it is different; i have lost all that bound me to life , death smiles and invites me to repose; i die after my own manner , i die exhausted and broken - spirited , as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cell ,that is thirty thousand steps , or about ten leagues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed , arranged his couch to the best of his power , ate little and slept less , and found existence almost supportable , because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure , like a worn - out garment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two methods of self - destruction were at his disposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars , or refuse food and die of starvation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the first was repugnant to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates , who are hung up to the yard - arm; he would not die by what seemed an infamous death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he resolved to adopt the second , and began that day to carry out his resolve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants said ,  - i wish to die , and had chosen the manner of his death , and fearful of changing his mind , he had taken an oath to die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he kept his word; twice a day he cast out , through the barred aperture , the provisions his jailer brought himat first gayly , then with deliberation , and at last with regret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hunger made viands once repugnant , now acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time , and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat , of tainted fish , of black and mouldy bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less sombre , his prospects less desperate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was still younghe was only four or five - and - twentyhe had nearly fifty years to live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what unforseen events might not open his prison door , and restore him to liberty? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he raised to his lips the repast that , like a voluntary tantalus , he refused himself; but he thought of his oath , and he would not break it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he persisted until , at last , he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning he could not see or hear; the jailer feared he was dangerously ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond hoped he was dying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus the day passed away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content; the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased; his thirst had abated; when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will - o  - the - wisps that play about the marshes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly , about nine o clock in the evening , edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a continual scratching , as if made by a huge claw , a powerful tooth , or some iron instrument attacking the stones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although weakened , the young man s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisonersliberty! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him , and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him , and striving to diminish the distance that separated them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , no , doubtless he was deceived , and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond still heard the sound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it lasted nearly three hours; he then heard a noise of something falling , and all was silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some hours afterwards it began again , nearer and more distinct . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond was intensely interested . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly the jailer entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a week since he had resolved to die , and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose , edmond had not spoken to the attendant , had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him , and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it , and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jailer brought him his breakfast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants raised himself up and began to talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food , about the coldness of his dungeon , grumbling and complaining , in order to have an excuse for speaking louder , and wearying the patience of his jailer , who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fortunately , he fancied that dants was delirious; and placing the food on the rickety table , he withdrew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there can be no doubt about it , thought he;  - it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly another idea took possession of his mind , so used to misfortune , that it was scarcely capable of hopethe idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was easy to ascertain this; but how could he risk the question? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was easy to call his jailer s attention to the noise , and watch his countenance as he listened; but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short - lived satisfaction of his own curiosity? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought , rose , staggered towards it , raised the vessel to his lips , and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had the resolution to stop with this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour , and returned to his couchhe did not wish to die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he said to himself: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must put this to the test , but without compromising anybody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if it is a workman , i need but knock against the wall , and he will cease to work , in order to find out who is knocking , and why he does so; but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor , he will soon resume it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if , on the contrary , it is a prisoner , the noise i make will alarm him , he will cease , and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond rose again , but this time his legs did not tremble , and his sight was clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon , detached a stone , and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he struck thrice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the first blow the sound ceased , as if by magic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond listened intently; an hour passed , two hours passed , and no sound was heard from the wallall was silent there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> full of hope , edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water , and , thanks to the vigor of his constitution , found himself well - nigh recovered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day passed away in utter silencenight came without recurrence of the noise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a prisoner , said edmond joyfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his brain was on fire , and life and energy returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the night passed in perfect silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond did not close his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisionshe had already devoured those of the previous day; he ate these listening anxiously for the sound , walking round and round his cell , shaking the iron bars of the loophole , restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise , and so preparing himself for his future destiny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again , and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner , who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three days passedseventy - two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he moved away , walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts , and then went back and listened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the matter was no longer doubtful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> encouraged by this discovery , edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he began by moving his bed , and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall , penetrate the moist cement , and displace a stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all his furniture consisted of a bed , a chair , a table , a pail , and a jug . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bed had iron clamps , but they were screwed to the wood , and it would have required a screw - driver to take them off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants had but one resource , which was to break the jug , and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he let the jug fall on the floor , and it broke in pieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond had all the night to work in , but in the darkness he could not do much , and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard; he pushed back his bed , and waited for day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all night he heard the subterranean workman , who continued to mine his way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking , and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another , without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he returned speedily , advised the prisoner to be more careful , and departed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this idea imparted new energy , and in three days he had succeeded , with the utmost precaution , in removing the cement , and exposing the stone - work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wall was built of rough stones , among which , to give strength to the structure , blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants strove to do this with his nails , but they were too weak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fragments of the jug broke , and after an hour of useless toil , dants paused with anguish on his brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was he to be thus stopped at the beginning , and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly an idea occurred to himhe smiled , and the perspiration dried on his forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jailer always brought dants  soup in an iron saucepan; this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners , for dants had noticed that it was either quite full , or half empty , according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the handle of this saucepan was of iron; dants would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dants  plate , and dants , after eating his soup with a wooden spoon , washed the plate , which thus served for every day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now when evening came dants put his plate on the ground near the door; the jailer , as he entered , stepped on it and broke it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time he could not blame dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was wrong to leave it there , but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jailer , therefore , only grumbled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he looked about for something to pour the soup into; dants  entire dinner service consisted of one platethere was no alternative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this advice was to the jailer s taste , as it spared him the necessity of making another trip . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he left the saucepan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants was beside himself with joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a slight oscillation showed dants that all went well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall , leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor , he continued to work without ceasing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , don t you intend to bring me another plate? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied the turnkey;  - you destroy everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first you break your jug , then you make me break your plate; if all the prisoners followed your example , the government would be ruined . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall leave you the saucepan , and pour your soup into that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the hour for his jailer s visit arrived , dants straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could , and placed it in its accustomed place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it , together with the fishfor thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this would have been a method of reckoning time , had not dants long ceased to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having poured out the soup , the turnkey retired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he listenedall was silent , as it had been for the last three days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants sighed; it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , he toiled on all the night without being discouraged; but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the iron made no impression , but met with a smooth surface; dants touched it , and found that it was a beam . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this beam crossed , or rather blocked up , the hole dants had made; it was necessary , therefore , to dig above or under it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my god , my god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who talks of god and despair at the same time? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth , and , deadened by the distance , sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man s ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said he ,  - i hear a human voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the name of heaven , cried dants ,  - speak again , though the sound of your voice terrifies me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an unhappy prisoner , replied dants , who made no hesitation in answering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of what country? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a frenchman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - edmond dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your profession? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a sailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how long have you been here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your crime? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - but of what are you accused? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the emperor s return? the emperor is no longer on the throne , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he abdicated at fontainebleau in 1814 , and was sent to the island of elba . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - since 1811 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants shuddered; this man had been four years longer than himself in prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on a level with the floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - behind my bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a corridor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and the corridor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on a court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured the voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i took the wrong angle , and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but then you would be close to the sea? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is what i hoped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and supposing you had succeeded? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - could you have swum so far? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - heaven would have given me strength; but now all is lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; stop up your excavation carefully , do not work any more , and wait until you hear from me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ami am no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 27 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i am a christian , cried dants , guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you do , i swear to you , for i have got to the end of my strength , that i will dash my brains out against the wall , and you will have my death to reproach yourself with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know my age , for i have not counted the years i have been here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all i do know is , that i was just nineteen when i was arrested , the 28th of february , 1815 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not quite twenty - six! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i swear to you again , rather than betray you , i would allow myself to be hacked in pieces! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will not forget you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how long? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must calculate our chances; i will give you the signal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you will not leave me; you will come to me , or you will let me come to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will escape , and if we cannot escape we will talk; you of those whom you love , and i of those whom i love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i am alone in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you are young , i will be your comrade; if you are old , i will be your son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have a father who is seventy if he yet lives; i only love him and a young girl called mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity; dants rose , dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before , and pushed his bed back against the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was , perhaps , about to regain his liberty; at the worst , he would have a companion , and captivity that is shared is but half captivity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all day dants walked up and down his cell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sat down occasionally on his bed , pressing his hand on his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jailer came in the evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants was on his bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes , for the jailer said ,  - come , are you going mad again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jailer went away shaking his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> night came; dants hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him , but he was mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning , however , just as he removed his bed from the wall , he heard three knocks; he threw himself on his knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he;  - i am here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a moment that part of the floor on which dants was resting his two hands , as he knelt with his head in the opening , suddenly gave way; he drew back smartly , while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then from the bottom of this passage , the depth of which it was impossible to measure , he saw appear , first the head , then the shoulders , and lastly the body of a man , who sprang lightly into his cell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired , dants almost carried him towards the window , in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his thin face , deeply furrowed by care , and the bold outline of his strongly marked features , betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty - five years; but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure , as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome , although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us first see , said he ,  - whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance hereour future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> advancing to the opening , he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight; then , fitting it into its place , he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , exclaimed dants , with astonishment ,  - do you possess any? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i made myself some; and with the exception of a file , i have all that are necessary ,a chisel , pincers , and lever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , in the first place , here is my chisel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , he displayed a sharp strong blade , with a handle made of beechwood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and with what did you contrive to make that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> responded dants , almost terrified . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not speak so loud , young mandon t speak so loud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it frequently occurs in a state prison like this , that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but they believe i am shut up alone here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that makes no difference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine; only , unfortunately , i did not curve aright; for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion , instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet , i made it fifty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my labor is all in vain , for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s true , said dants;  - but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell; there are three othersdo you know anything of their situation? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this one is built against the solid rock , and it would take ten experienced miners , duly furnished with the requisite tools , as many years to perforate it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this adjoins the lower part of the governor s apartments , and were we to work our way through , we should only get into some lock - up cellars , where we must necessarily be recaptured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fourth and last side of your cell faces onfaces onstop a minute , now where does it face? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this loophole , which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside , to an opening through which a child could not have passed , was , for better security , furnished with three iron bars , so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner s escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the stranger asked the question , he dragged the table beneath the window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger , whom as yet dants knew only by the number of his cell , sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years , and , light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard , climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dants , and from them to his shoulders; then , bending double , for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect , he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window , so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head , saying ,  - i thought so! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and sliding from the shoulders of dants as dextrously as he had ascended , he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what was it that you thought? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the young man anxiously , in his turn descending from the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the elder prisoner pondered the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said he at length ,  - it is so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you quite sure of that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw the soldier s shape and the top of his musket; that made me draw in my head so quickly , for i was fearful he might also see me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then pursued the young man eagerly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , answered the elder prisoner ,  - the will of god be done! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - willingly , answered the stranger;  - if , indeed , you feel any curiosity respecting one , now , alas , powerless to aid you in any way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray let me know who you really are? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger smiled a melancholy smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then listen , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am the abb faria , and have been imprisoned as you know in this chteau d if since the year 1811; previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of fenestrelle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the year 1811 i was transferred to piedmont in france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon , had bestowed on him a son , named king of rome even in his cradle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then who reigns in france at this momentnapoleon ii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the brother of louis xvi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants  whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , continued he ,  -  twill be the same as it was in england . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after charles i . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , cromwell; after cromwell , charles ii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , and then james ii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then new concessions to the people , then a constitution , then liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the abb , turning towards dants , and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet ,  - you are young , you will see all this come to pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , replied faria ,  - we are prisoners; but i forget this sometimes , and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls , and i fancy myself at liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but wherefore are you here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because in 1807 i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in 1811; because , like machiavelli , i desired to alter the political face of italy , and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities , each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler , i sought to form one large , compact , and powerful empire; and , lastly , because i fancied i had found my csar borgia in a crowned simpleton , who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and clement vii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , but it will never succeed now , for they attempted it fruitlessly , and napoleon was unable to complete his work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> italy seems fated to misfortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the old man bowed his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> napoleon certainly he knew something of , inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him; but of clement vii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and alexander vi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he knew nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you not , he asked ,  - the priest who here in the chteau d if is generally thought to beill? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mad , you mean , don t you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did not like to say so , answered dants , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , resumed faria with a bitter smile ,  - let me answer your question in full , by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the chteau d if , for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity; and , in all probability , i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children , if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you abandon all hope of escape? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated , that you talk of beginning over again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first place , i was four years making the tools i possess , and have been two years scraping and digging out earth , hard as granite itself; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones i should once have deemed impossible to loosen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking , for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise; and now , at the moment when i reckoned upon success , my hopes are forever dashed from me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants held down his head , that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abb s plans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> escape had never once occurred to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are , indeed , some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage , gave a fresh turn to his ideas , and inspired him with new courage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another , older and less strong than he , had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake , and had failed only because of an error in calculation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another had done all this; why , then , was it impossible to dants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria had dug his way through fifty feet , dants would dig a hundred; faria , at the age of fifty , had devoted three years to the task; he , who was but half as old , would sacrifice six; faria , a priest and savant , had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islandsdaume , rattonneau , or lemaire; should a hardy sailor , an experienced diver , like himself , shrink from a similar task; should he , who had so often for mere amusement s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch , hesitate to entertain the same project? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at once dants resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion , and to remember that what has once been done may be done again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria started:  - have you , indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried he , raising his head with quick anxiety;  - pray , let me know what it is you have discovered? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here , extends in the same direction as the outer gallery , does it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and is not above fifteen feet from it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - about that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , i will tell you what we must do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle , as it were the top part of a cross . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all we require to insure success is courage , and that you possess , and strength , which i am not deficient in; as for patience , you have abundantly proved yoursyou shall now see me prove mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one instant , my dear friend , replied the abb;  - it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed , and what use i intend making of my strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for patience , i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before , and every night renewing the task of the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked dants with much surprise;  - do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; neither do i wish to incur guilt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances , not men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall , or destroy a staircase; but i cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it possible , said he ,  - that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me , replied faria ,  - what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead , dressing yourself in his clothes , and endeavoring to escape? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me , answered dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because , said the old man ,  - the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it; and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tiger , whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood , needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach , and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim; but man , on the contrary , loathes the idea of bloodit is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life; his natural construction and physiological formation<s> <s> dants was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind , or rather soul; for there are two distinct sorts of ideas , those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - since my imprisonment , said faria ,  - i have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon , and carefully arranged; such , for instance , as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the chteau de vincennes , that of the abb dubuquoi from for l evque; of latude from the bastille . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us , therefore , wait patiently for some favorable moment , and when it presents itself , profit by it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said dants ,  - you might well endure the tedious delay; you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself , and when weary with toil , you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what did you do then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - were you then permitted the use of pens , ink , and paper? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , answered the abb;  - i had none but what i made for myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants gazed with admiration , but he had some difficulty in believing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mark s column at venice , and on the borders of the arno at florence , little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the chteau d if . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the work i speak of is called a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in italy , and will make one large quarto volume . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and on what have you written all this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on two of my shirts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are , then , a chemist? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but for such a work you must have needed bookshad you any? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome; but after reading them over many times , i found out that with one hundred and fifty well - chosen books a man possesses , if not a complete summary of all human knowledge , at least all that a man need really know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes , till i knew them nearly by heart; so that since i have been in prison , a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could recite you the whole of thucydides , xenophon , plutarch , titus livius , tacitus , strada , jornandes , dante , montaigne , shakespeare , spinoza , machiavelli , and bossuet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are , doubtless , acquainted with a variety of languages , so as to have been able to read all these? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i speak five of the modern tonguesthat is to say , german , french , italian , english , and spanish; by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greeki don t speak it so well as i could wish , but i am still trying to improve myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - improve yourself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know nearly one thousand words , which is all that is absolutely necessary , although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot hope to be very fluent , but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes; and that would be quite as much as i should ever require . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stronger grew the wonder of dants , who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings , he added ,  - then if you were not furnished with pens , how did you manage to write the work you speak of? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , i selected the cartilages of the heads of these fishes , and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which i welcomed the arrival of each wednesday , friday , and saturday , as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for i will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while retracing the past , i forget the present; and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but the ink , said dants;  - of what did you make your ink? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , it must have been many years in use , for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot; this soot i dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every sunday , and i assure you a better ink cannot be desired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , then let it be directly! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - follow me , then , said the abb , as he re - entered the subterranean passage , in which he soon disappeared , followed by dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage , which , however , did not admit of their holding themselves erect , the two friends reached the further end of the corridor , into which the abb s cell opened; from that point the passage became much narrower , and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he entered the chamber of his friend , dants cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels , but nothing more than common met his view . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is well , said the abb;  - we have some hours before usit is now just a quarter past twelve o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instinctively dants turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abb had been able so accurately to specify the hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look at this ray of light which enters by my window , said the abb ,  - and then observe the lines traced on the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , by means of these lines , which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth , and the ellipse it describes round the sun , i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements , while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a double movement of the globe he inhabited , and of which he could feel nothing , appeared to him perfectly impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each word that fell from his companion s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science , as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda , which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said he to the abb ,  - i am anxious to see your treasures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb smiled , and , proceeding to the disused fireplace , raised , by the help of his chisel , a long stone , which had doubtless been the hearth , beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth , serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you wish to see first? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , your great work on the monarchy of italy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria then drew forth from his hiding - place three or four rolls of linen , laid one over the other , like folds of papyrus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long; they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing , so legible that dants could easily read it , as well as make out the senseit being in italian , a language he , as a provenal , perfectly understood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty - eighth strip about a week ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see , answered dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants examined it with intense admiration , then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that s my masterpiece . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife , it would serve a double purpose , and with it one could cut and thrust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i worked at night also , replied faria . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - night! why , for heaven s sake , are your eyes like cats  , that you can see to work in the dark? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed they are not; but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray tell me how . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , the abb exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and matches? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin , and asked for a little sulphur , which was readily supplied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants laid the different things he had been looking at on the table , and stood with his head drooping on his breast , as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of faria s mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have not seen all yet , continued faria ,  - for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding - place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us shut this one up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they put the stone back in its place; the abb sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed , rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other , and then , going towards his bed , he removed it from the spot it stood in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind the head of the bed , and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion , was a hollow space , and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty - five and thirty feet in length . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i tore up several of my shirts , and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed , during my three years  imprisonment at fenestrelle; and when i was removed to the chteau d if , i managed to bring the ravellings with me , so that i have been able to finish my work here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , for when i had taken out the thread i required , i hemmed the edges over again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i once thought , continued faria ,  - of removing these iron bars , and letting myself down from the window , which , as you see , is somewhat wider than yours , although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight; however , i discovered that i should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court , and i therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless , i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now , and which sudden chance frequently brings about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what are you thinking of? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was reflecting , in the first place , replied dants ,  - upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what would you not have accomplished if you had been free? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably , in a state of freedom , have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> compression is needed to explode gunpowder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is producedfrom electricity , lightning , from lightning , illumination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said he ,  - but you had another subject for your thoughts; did you not say so just now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have told me as yet but one of themlet me hear the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was this ,that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life , you were perfectly unacquainted with mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your life , my young friend , has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said the abb , closing his hiding - place , and pushing the bed back to its original situation ,  - let me hear your story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from this point everything was a blank to dantshe knew nothing more , not even the length of time he had been imprisoned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his recital finished , the abb reflected long and earnestly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is , said he , at the end of his meditations ,  - a clever maxim , which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago , and that is , that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved mind , human nature , in a right and wholesome state , revolts at crime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , from an artificial civilization have originated wants , vices , and false tastes , which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings , and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from this view of things , then , comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action , seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , to apply it in your case ,to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , in the event of the king s death , his successor inherits a crown ,when the employee dies , the supernumerary steps into his shoes , and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone , from the highest to the lowest degree , has his place on the social ladder , and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests , as in descartes  theory of pressure and impulsion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but these forces increase as we go higher , so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the pharaon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what say you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was generally liked on board , and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves , i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill - will towards me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had quarelled with him some time previously , and had even challenged him to fight me; but he refused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now we are getting on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what was this man s name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he was supercargo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and had you been captain , should you have retained him in his employment? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now then , tell me , was any person present during your last conversation with captain leclere? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of elba? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - somebody there received your packet , and gave you a letter in place of it , i think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; the grand marshal did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - put it into my portfolio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what did you do with this same letter while returning from porto - ferrajo to the vessel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i carried it in my hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so that when you went on board the pharaon , everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - danglars , as well as the rest? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - danglars , as well as others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh yes , i read it over three times , and the words sank deeply into my memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - repeat it to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants paused a moment , then said ,  - this is it , word for word: the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion , that one edmond dants , mate on board the pharaon , this day arrived from smyrna , after having touched at naples and porto - ferrajo , has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper; again , by the usurper , with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the abb shrugged his shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the thing is clear as day , said he;  - and you must have had a very confiding nature , as well as a good heart , not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how did danglars usually write? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and how was the anonymous letter written? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - backhanded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again the abb smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was very boldly written , if disguised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stop a bit , said the abb , taking up what he called his pen , and , after dipping it into the ink , he wrote on a piece of prepared linen , with his left hand , the first two or three words of the accusation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants drew back , and gazed on the abb with a sensation almost amounting to terror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how very astonishing! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried he at length . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand; and i have noticed that<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies , that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have evidently seen and observed everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us proceed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , yes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am listening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and his name was<s> <s>  - fernand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is a spanish name , i think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he was a catalan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is in strict accordance with the spanish character; an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit , but an act of cowardice , never . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - besides , said dants ,  - the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not even to your mistress? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , not even to my betrothed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then it is danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i feel quite sure of it now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait a little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray , was danglars acquainted with fernand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now i recollect<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at pre pamphile s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were in earnest conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars was joking in a friendly way , but fernand looked pale and agitated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stay! stay! how strange that it should not have occurred to me before! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now i remember quite well , that on the table round which they were sitting were pens , ink , and paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , the heartless , treacherous scoundrels! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is there anything else i can assist you in discovering , besides the villany of your friends? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , replied dants eagerly;  - i would beg of you , who see so completely to the depths of things , and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle , to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination , was never brought to trial , and , above all , was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all we have hitherto done in the matter has been child s play . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business , you must assist me by the most minute information on every point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the deputy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - was he young or old? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - about six or seven - and - twenty years of age , i should say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and how did he treat you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with more of mildness than severity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you tell him your whole story? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he seemed quite overcome by my misfortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by your misfortune? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the accusation? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that alters the case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man might , after all , be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , said dants ,  - you make me shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; and remember that two - legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never mind; let us go on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with all my heart! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you tell me he burned the letter? </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , it is not altogether impossible he might have had , for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone , assuring me he so advised me for my own interest; and , more than this , he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - noirtier! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated the abb;  - noirtier! i knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria ,a noirtier , who had been a girondin during the revolution! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was your deputy called? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb burst into a fit of laughter , while dants gazed on him in utter astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what ails you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he at length . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you see that ray of sunlight? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor fellow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor young man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , you poor short - sighted simpleton , can you not guess who this noirtier was , whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this noirtier was his father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> starting up , he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting , and exclaimed ,  - his father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , his father , replied the abb;  - his right name was noirtier de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the change that had come over villefort during the examination , the destruction of the letter , the exacted promise , the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate , who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment ,all returned with a stunning force to his memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried out , and staggered against the wall like a drunken man , then he hurried to the opening that led from the abb s cell to his own , and said ,  - i must be alone , to think over all this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he regained his dungeon , he threw himself on his bed , where the turnkey found him in the evening visit , sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features , dumb and motionless as a statue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during these hours of profound meditation , which to him had seemed only minutes , he had formed a fearful resolution , and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria , who , having also been visited by his jailer , had come to invite his fellow - sufferer to share his supper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the reputation of being out of his mind , though harmlessly and even amusingly so , had procured for the abb unusual privileges . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was supplied with bread of a finer , whiter quality than the usual prison fare , and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now this was a sunday , and the abb had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants followed him; his features were no longer contracted , and now wore their usual expression , but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria bent on him his penetrating eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because it has instilled a new passion in your heartthat of vengeance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again the abb looked at him , then mournfully shook his head; but in accordance with dants  request , he began to speak of other matters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation , like that of all who have experienced many trials , contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information; but it was never egotistical , for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a part of the good abb s words , however , were wholly incomprehensible to him; but , like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes , opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener , and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons , enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth , where he was so much at home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must teach me a small part of what you know , said dants ,  - if only to prevent your growing weary of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , my boy , said he ,  - human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits; and when i have taught you mathematics , physics , history , and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted , you will know as much as i do myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed dants;  - do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not their application , certainly , but their principles you may; to learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but cannot one learn philosophy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to truth; it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am in a hurry to begin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i want to learn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - everything , said the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education , to be entered upon the following day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he already knew italian , and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east; and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others , so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish , english , and german . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in strict accordance with the promise made to the abb , dants spoke no more of escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> days , even months , passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of a year dants was a new man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants observed , however , that faria , in spite of the relief his society afforded , daily grew sadder; one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes he would fall into long reveries , sigh heavily and involuntarily , then suddenly rise , and , with folded arms , begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day he stopped all at once , and exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , if there were no sentinel! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there shall not be one a minute longer than you please , said dants , who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and yet the murder , if you choose to call it so , would be simply a measure of self - preservation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could never agree to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - still , you have thought of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - incessantly , alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom , have you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , cried the abb;  - impossible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants endeavored to renew the subject; the abb shook his head in token of disapproval , and refused to make any further response . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb asked one day of dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man , in reply , took up the chisel , bent it into the form of a horseshoe , and then as readily straightened it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry , except as a last resort? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i promise on my honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said the abb ,  - we may hope to put our design into execution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at least a year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and shall we begin at once? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we have lost a year to no purpose! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - forgive me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried edmond , blushing deeply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tut , tut! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> answered the abb ,  - man is but man after all , and you are about the best specimen of the genus i have ever known . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , let me show you my plan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of dants , with the passage which united them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines; this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch; once there , a large excavation would be made , and one of the flag - stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier , who , stunned by his fall , would be immediately bound and gagged by dants before he had power to offer any resistance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows , and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abb s ladder of cords . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants  eyes sparkled with joy , and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple , yet apparently so certain to succeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey s visits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons , and happily , never failed of being prepared for his coming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking , the only tools for which had been a chisel , a knife , and a wooden lever; faria still continuing to instruct dants by conversing with him , sometimes in one language , sometimes in another; at others , relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb was a man of the world , and had , moreover , mixed in the first society of the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dants , thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature , easily acquired , as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in , and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of fifteen months the level was finished , and the excavation completed beneath the gallery , and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria , who had remained in edmond s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope - ladder , call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants hastened to his dungeon , where he found him standing in the middle of the room , pale as death , his forehead streaming with perspiration , and his hands clenched tightly together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gracious heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed dants ,  - what is the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what has happened? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> quick! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> returned the abb ,  - listen to what i have to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria , whose eyes , already dull and sunken , were surrounded by purple circles , while his lips were white as those of a corpse , and his very hair seemed to stand on end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried dants , letting his chisel fall to the floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , faltered out the abb ,  - all is over with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am seized with a terrible , perhaps mortal illness; i can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this malady admits but of one remedy; i will tell you what that is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes , dants did not lose his presence of mind , but descended into the passage , dragging his unfortunate companion with him; then , half - carrying , half - supporting him , he managed to reach the abb s chamber , when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead , uttering neither sigh nor groan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the other hand , the symptoms may be much more violent , and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions , foam at the mouth , and cry out loudly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take care my cries are not heard , for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison , and we be separated forever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i become quite motionless , cold , and rigid as a corpse , then , and not before ,be careful about this ,force open my teeth with the knife , pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat , and i may perhaps revive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed dants in grief - stricken tones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - help! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the abb ,  - iidiei<s> <s> so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole frame , his eyes started from their sockets , his mouth was drawn on one side , his cheeks became purple , he struggled , foamed , dashed himself about , and uttered the most dreadful cries , which , however , dants prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fit lasted two hours; then , more helpless than an infant , and colder and paler than marble , more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot , he fell back , doubled up in one last convulsion , and became as rigid as a corpse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend , then , taking up the knife , he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws , carefully administered the appointed number of drops , and anxiously awaited the result . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy , and , thrusting his hands into his hair , continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks , consciousness returned to the dull , open eyeballs , a faint sigh issued from the lips , and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is saved! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is saved! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried dants in a paroxysm of delight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sick man was not yet able to speak , but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants listened , and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had scarcely done so before the door opened , and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> almost before the key had turned in the lock , and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse , dants , whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him , hurried back to the abb s chamber , and raising the stone by pressing his head against it , was soon beside the sick man s couch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria had now fully regained his consciousness , but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did not expect to see you again , said he feebly , to dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you fancy yourself dying? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i had no such idea; but , knowing that all was ready for flight , i thought you might have made your escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - without you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you really think me capable of that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas , alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be of good cheer , replied dants;  - your strength will return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb shook his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the last attack i had , said he ,  - lasted but half an hour , and after it i was hungry , and got up without help; now i can move neither my right arm nor leg , and my head seems uncomfortable , which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we shall save you another time , as we have done this , only with a better chance of success , because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my good edmond , answered the abb ,  - be not deceived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> none can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , we will wait ,a week , a month , two months , if need be ,and meanwhile your strength will return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything is in readiness for our flight , and we can select any time we choose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as you feel able to swim we will go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall never swim again , replied faria . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this arm is paralyzed; not for a time , but forever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lift it , and judge if i am mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are convinced now , edmond , are you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , i expected it , for it is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken , was no other than the celebrated cabanis , and he predicted a similar end for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the physician may be mistaken! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and as for your poor arm , what difference will that make? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can take you on my shoulders , and swim for both of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man s head , he slowly added ,  - by the blood of christ i swear never to leave you while you live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as i cannot , and you will not , quit this place , it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier s gallery; he might , by chance , hear the hollow sound of his footsteps , and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go , then , and set about this work , in which , unhappily , i can offer you no assistance; keep at it all night , if necessary , and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants took the hand of the abb in his , and affectionately pressed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell , he held open in his left hand , of which alone , it will be recollected , he retained the use , a sheet of paper , which , from being constantly rolled into a small compass , had the form of a cylinder , and was not easily kept open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not speak , but showed the paper to dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look at it , said the abb with a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have looked at it with all possible attention , said dants ,  - and i only see a half - burnt paper , on which are traces of gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this paper , my friend , said faria ,  - i may now avow to you , since i have the proof of your fidelitythis paper is my treasure , of which , from this day forth , one - half belongs to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sweat started forth on dants  brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord , and faria had been equally silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by faria , after so painful a crisis , seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stammered dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have , indeed , a noble nature , edmond , and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , be assured , i am not mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this treasure exists , dants , and if i have not been allowed to possess it , you will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yesyou . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one would listen or believe me , because everyone thought me mad; but you , who must know that i am not , listen to me , and believe me so afterwards if you will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , murmured edmond to himself ,  - this is a terrible relapse! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was only this blow wanting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he said aloud ,  - my dear friend , your attack has , perhaps , fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tomorrow , if you will , i will hear your narrative; but today i wish to nurse you carefully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , he said ,  - a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on the contrary , it is a matter of the utmost importance , edmond! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who knows if tomorrow , or the next day after , the third attack may not come on? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then must not all be over? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , indeed , i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches , which would make the wealth of a dozen families , will be forever lost to those men who persecute me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now i have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that i see you , young and with a promising future ,now that i think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure , i shudder at any delay , and tremble lest i should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond turned away his head with a sigh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my words have not convinced you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i see you require proofs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tomorrow , my dear friend , said edmond , desirous of not yielding to the old man s madness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then we will not talk of it until tomorrow; but read this paper today . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will not irritate him , thought edmond , and taking the paper , of which half was wanting ,having been burnt , no doubt , by some accident ,he read: </s> </s>

<s> <s> said faria , when the young man had finished reading it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , replied dants ,  - i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words , which are rendered illegible by fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , to you , my friend , who read them for the first time; but not for me , who have grown pale over them by many nights  study , and have reconstructed every phrase , completed every thought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sure i have , and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen to the history of this paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - silence! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - steps approachi goadieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and dants , happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend s mental instability , glided like a snake along the narrow passage; while faria , restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity , pushed the stone into place with his foot , and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the governor , who , hearing of faria s illness from the jailer , had come in person to see him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria sat up to receive him , avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his fear was lest the governor , touched with pity , might order him to be removed to better quarters , and thus separate him from his young companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but fortunately this was not the case , and the governor left him , convinced that the poor madman , for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection , was only troubled with a slight indisposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during this time , edmond , seated on his bed with his head in his hands , tried to collect his scattered thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria , since their first acquaintance , had been on all points so rational and logical , so wonderfully sagacious , in fact , that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was faria deceived as to his treasure , or was all the world deceived as to faria? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants remained in his cell all day , not daring to return to his friend , thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced , once for all , that the abb was madsuch a conviction would be so terrible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by , faria , not seeing the young man appear , tried to move and get over the distance which separated them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his leg was inert , and he could no longer make use of one arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond was obliged to assist him , for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dants  chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here i am , pursuing you remorselessly , he said with a benignant smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you thought to escape my munificence , but it is in vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> listen to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond saw there was no escape , and placing the old man on his bed , he seated himself on the stool beside him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know , said the abb ,  - that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada , the last of the princes of that name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was not rich , although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb , and i heard the phrase very often , as rich as a spada . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but he , like public rumor , lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes , and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day when i was reproaching him for his unavailing searches , and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them , he looked at me , and , smiling bitterly , opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there , in the twentieth chapter of the life of pope alexander vi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , were the following lines , which i can never forget: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the great wars of romagna had ended; csar borgia , who had completed his conquest , had need of money to purchase all italy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> king of france , who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and it was necessary , therefore , to have recourse to some profitable scheme , which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he determined to make two cardinals . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - by choosing two of the greatest personages of rome , especially rich menthis was the return the holy father looked for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first place , he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell besides . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a third point in view , which will appear hereafter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the pope and csar borgia first found the two future cardinals; they were giovanni rospigliosi , who held four of the highest dignities of the holy see , and csar spada , one of the noblest and richest of the roman nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the result was , that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals , and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation , and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pope heaped attentions upon rospigliosi and spada , conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate , and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the pope and csar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this key was furnished with a small iron point ,a negligence on the part of the locksmith . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then there was the ring with the lion s head , which csar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lion bit the hand thus favored , and at the end of twenty - four hours , the bite was mortal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - csar proposed to his father , that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard , or shake hands with them; but alexander vi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied: now as to the worthy cardinals , spada and rospigliosi , let us ask both of them to dinner , something tells me that we shall get that money back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , you forget , csar , an indigestion declares itself immediately , while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  csar gave way before such cogent reasoning , and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rospigliosi , quite set up with his new dignities , went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spada , a prudent man , and greatly attached to his only nephew , a young captain of the highest promise , took paper and pen , and made his will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  but it was a legate  latere , who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope , his holiness requests you to dine with him . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - spada set out about two o clock to san pierdarena . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spada turned pale , as csar looked at him with an ironical air , which proved that he had anticipated all , and that the snare was well spread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they began dinner and spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was too late , for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine , placed for him expressly by the pope s butler . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him , which he was pressed to taste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the heirs sought everywhere , admired the breviary , laid hands on the furniture , and were greatly astonished that spada , the rich man , was really the most miserable of unclesno treasuresunless they were those of science , contained in the library and laboratories . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that was all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> csar and his father searched , examined , scrutinized , but found nothing , or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate , and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired: look well among my uncle s papers; there is a will . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done , but it was fruitless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were two palaces and a vineyard behind the palatine hill; but in these days landed property had not much value , and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> months and years rolled on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alexander vi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> died , poisoned ,you know by what mistake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> csar , poisoned at the same time , escaped by shedding his skin like a snake; but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , compelled to quit rome , he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish , scarcely noticed in history . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the spadas remained in doubtful ease , a mystery hung over this dark affair , and the public rumor was , that csar , a better politician than his father , had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say the two , because cardinal rospigliosi , who had not taken any precaution , was completely despoiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - up to this point , said faria , interrupting the thread of his narrative ,  - this seems to you very meaningless , no doubt , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my friend , cried dants ,  - on the contrary , it seems as if i were reading a most interesting narrative; go on , i beg of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i come now to the last of the family , whose secretary i wasthe count of spada . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune; and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did so , and thus doubled his income . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it had been handed down from father to son; for the singular clause of the only will that had been found , had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic , preserved in the family with superstitious veneration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was an illuminated book , with beautiful gothic characters , and so weighty with gold , that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at the sight of papers of all sorts ,titles , contracts , parchments , which were kept in the archives of the family , all descending from the poisoned cardinal , i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents , like twenty servitors , stewards , secretaries before me; but in spite of the most exhaustive researches , i foundnothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was useless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all these he bequeathed to me , with a thousand roman crowns , which he had in ready money , on condition that i would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul , and that i would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this i did scrupulously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be easy , my dear edmond , we are near the conclusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in 1807 , a month before i was arrested , and a fortnight after the death of the count of spada , on the 25th of december ( you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory ) , i was reading , for the thousandth time , the papers i was arranging , for the palace was sold to a stranger , and i was going to leave rome and settle at florence , intending to take with me twelve thousand francs i possessed , my library , and the famous breviary , when , tired with my constant labor at the same thing , and overcome by a heavy dinner i had eaten , my head dropped on my hands , and i fell asleep about three o clock in the afternoon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i awoke as the clock was striking six . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i raised my head; i was in utter darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i rang for a light , but , as no one came , i determined to find one for myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i took a wax - candle in one hand , and with the other groped about for a piece of paper ( my match - box being empty ) , with which i proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fearing , however , to make use of any valuable piece of paper , i hesitated for a moment , then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary , which was on the table beside me , an old paper quite yellow with age , and which had served as a marker for centuries , kept there by the request of the heirs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i felt for it , found it , twisted it up together , and putting it into the expiring flame , set light to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was that paper you read this morning; read it again , dants , and then i will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria , with an air of triumph , offered the paper to dants , who this time read the following words , traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust: </s> </s>

<s> <s>ar  spada . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , do you comprehend now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired faria . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is the declaration of cardinal spada , and the will so long sought for , replied edmond , still incredulous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; a thousand times , yes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who completed it as it now is? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , continued faria , addressing dants with an almost paternal expression ,  - now , my dear fellow , you know as much as i do myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , inquired dants hesitating ,  - has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , be easy on that score; the family is extinct . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said dants , staggered at the enormous amount . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times , when other opportunities for investment were wanting , such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day roman families perishing of hunger , though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels , handed down by entail , and which they cannot touch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond thought he was in a dreamhe wavered between incredulity and joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have only kept this secret so long from you , continued faria ,  - that i might test your character , and then surprise you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy , i should have conducted you to monte cristo; now , he added , with a sigh ,  - it is you who will conduct me thither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this treasure belongs to you , my dear friend , replied dants ,  - and to you only . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have no right to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am no relation of yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are my son , dants , exclaimed the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are the child of my captivity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my profession condemns me to celibacy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god has sent you to me to console , at one and the same time , the man who could not be a father , and the prisoner who could not get free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man , who threw himself upon his neck and wept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now that this treasure , which had so long been the object of the abb s meditations , could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son , it had doubled its value in his eyes , and every day he expatiated on the amount , explaining to dants all the good which , with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs , a man could do in these days to his friends; and then dants  countenance became gloomy , for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory , and he reflected how much ill , in these times , a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb did not know the island of monte cristo; but dants knew it , and had often passed it , situated twenty - five miles from pianosa , between corsica and the island of elba , and had once touched there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this island was , always had been , and still is , completely deserted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a rock of almost conical form , which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants drew a plan of the island for faria , and faria gave dants advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but dants was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic , and the way in which he had achieved the discovery , which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness , increased edmond s admiration of him; but at the same time dants could not believe that the deposit , supposing it had ever existed , still existed; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical , he yet believed it was no longer there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance , and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment , a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea side , which had long been in ruins , was rebuilt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but for this precaution , which , it will be remembered , the abb had made to edmond , the misfortune would have been still greater , for their attempt to escape would have been detected , and they would undoubtedly have been separated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus a new , a stronger , and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see , said the young man , with an air of sorrowful resignation , to faria ,  - that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have promised to remain forever with you , and now i could not break my promise if i would . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the treasure will be no more mine than yours , and neither of us will quit this prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them , and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced themthis is my treasure , my beloved friend , and with this you have made me rich and happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> believe me , and take comfort , this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds , even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea , which we take for terra firma , and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to have you as long as possible near me , to hear your eloquent speech ,which embellishes my mind , strengthens my soul , and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things , if i should ever be free ,so fills my whole existence , that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you , has no longer any hold over me; and thisthis is my fortunenot chimerical , but actual . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i owe you my real good , my present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth , even csar borgia himself , could not deprive me of this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria , who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure , now perpetually talked of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he had prophesied would be the case , he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg , and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion , and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen , he compelled dants to learn it by heart; and dants knew it from the first to the last word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dants ,instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , once free , from the day and hour and moment when he was so , he could have but one only thought , which was , to gain monte cristo by some means , and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there , to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns , and search in the appointed spot ,the appointed spot , be it remembered , being the farthest angle in the second opening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria , as we have said , without having recovered the use of his hand and foot , had regained all the clearness of his understanding , and had gradually , besides the moral instructions we have detailed , taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner , who learns to make something from nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were thus perpetually employed ,faria , that he might not see himself grow old; dants , for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one night edmond awoke suddenly , believing that he heard someone calling him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he opened his eyes upon utter darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , murmured edmond;  - can it be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he moved his bed , drew up the stone , rushed into the passage , and reached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp , of which we have spoken , dants saw the old man , pale , but yet erect , clinging to the bedstead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , my dear friend , said faria in a resigned tone ,  - you understand , do you not , and i need not attempt to explain to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we must now only think of you , my dear friend , and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps he will be young , strong , and enduring , like yourself , and will aid you in your escape , while i have been but a hindrance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim ,  - oh , my friend , my friend , speak not thus! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then resuming all his presence of mind , which had for a moment staggered under this blow , and his strength , which had failed at the words of the old man , he said ,  - oh , i have saved you once , and i will save you a second time! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and raising the foot of the bed , he drew out the phial , still a third filled with the red liquor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - see , he exclaimed ,  - there remains still some of the magic draught . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me what i must do this time; are there any fresh instructions? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is not a hope , replied faria , shaking his head ,  - but no matter; god wills it that man whom he has created , and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life , should do all in his power to preserve that existence , which , however painful it may be , is yet always so dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , yes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed dants;  - and i tell you that i will save you yet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , try . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cold gains upon me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these horrible chills , which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones , begin to pervade my whole frame; in five minutes the malady will reach its height , and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed dants , his heart wrung with anguish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do as you did before , only do not wait so long , all the springs of life are now exhausted in me , and death , he continued , looking at his paralyzed arm and leg ,  - has but half its work to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if , after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten , you see that i do not recover , then pour the rest down my throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond took the old man in his arms , and laid him on the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now , my dear friend , said faria ,  - sole consolation of my wretched existence ,you whom heaven gave me somewhat late , but still gave me , a priceless gift , and for which i am most grateful ,at the moment of separating from you forever , i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my son , i bless thee! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , now , to what i say in this my dying moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the treasure of the spadas exists . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i see it in the depths of the inner cavern . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth , and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you do escape , remember that the poor abb , whom all the world called mad , was not so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hasten to monte cristoavail yourself of the fortunefor you have indeed suffered long enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - adieu , adieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured the old man , clasping edmond s hand convulsively - adieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no ,no , not yet , he cried;  - do not forsake me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , succor him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> helphelphelp! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured the dying man ,  - that they may not separate us if you save me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , yes , yes; be assured i shall save you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , although you suffer much , you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at your age we have faith in life; it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope , but old men see death more clearly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh ,  tis here tis here tis overmy sight is gonemy senses fail! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your hand , dants! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> adieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he fell back on the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants took the lamp , placed it on a projecting stone above the bed , whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless , stiffened body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he waited ten minutes , a quarter of an hour , half an hour ,no change took place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> trembling , his hair erect , his brow bathed with perspiration , he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he thought it was time to make the last trial , and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria , and without having occasion to force open his jaws , which had remained extended , he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the draught produced a galvanic effect , a violent trembling pervaded the old man s limbs , his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them , he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek , and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility , the eyes remaining open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> half an hour , an hour , an hour and a half elapsed , and during this period of anguish , edmond leaned over his friend , his hand applied to his heart , and felt the body gradually grow cold , and the heart s pulsation become more and more deep and dull , until at length it stopped; the last movement of the heart ceased , the face became livid , the eyes remained open , but the eyeballs were glazed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was six o clock in the morning , the dawn was just breaking , and its feeble ray came into the dungeon , and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him , and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed , he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes , which he tried many times to close , but in vainthey opened again as soon as shut . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was time , for the jailer was coming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this occasion he began his rounds at dants  cell , and on leaving him he went on to faria s dungeon , taking thither breakfast and some linen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery , and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey , who called out for help . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> other turnkeys came , and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> last of all came the governor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse , heard the voice of the governor , who asked them to throw water on the dead man s face; and seeing that , in spite of this application , the prisoner did not recover , they sent for the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the governor then went out , and words of pity fell on dants  listening ears , mingled with brutal laughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well , said one ,  - the madman has gone to look after his treasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good journey to him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with all his millions , he will not have enough to pay for his shroud! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , added a third voice ,  - the shrouds of the chteau d if are not dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they may give him the honors of the sack . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still he dared not to enter , as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of an hour , he heard a faint noise , which increased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the governor who returned , followed by the doctor and other attendants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a moment s silence ,it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the inquiries soon commenced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed , and declared that he was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made dants indignant , for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abb a love and respect equal to his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am very sorry for what you tell me , said the governor , replying to the assurance of the doctor ,  - that the old man is really dead; for he was a quiet , inoffensive prisoner , happy in his folly , and required no watching . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , added the turnkey ,  - there was no occasion for watching him; he would have stayed here fifty years , i ll answer for it , without any attempt to escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - still , said the governor ,  - i believe it will be requisite , notwithstanding your certainty , and not that i doubt your science , but in discharge of my official duty , that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may make your mind easy , said the doctor;  - he is dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will answer for that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know , sir , said the governor , persisting ,  - that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this order to heat the irons made dants shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here is the brazier , lighted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a moment s silence , and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh , of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dants was listening in horror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see , sir , he is really dead , said the doctor;  - this burn in the heel is decisive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor fool is cured of his folly , and delivered from his captivity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir; and , as he said , it was an ancient name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was , too , very learned , and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure; but on that , indeed , he was intractable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is the sort of malady which we call monomania , said the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you had never anything to complain of? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never , sir , replied the jailer ,  - never; on the contrary , he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day , too , when my wife was ill , he gave me a prescription which cured her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will that satisfy you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - must this last formality take place in your presence , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but make hastei cannot stay here all day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> other footsteps , going and coming , were now heard , and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dants  ears , the bed creaked , and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor; then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this evening , said the governor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will there be any mass? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked one of the attendants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pooh , pooh; said the doctor , with the impiety usual in persons of his profession;  - he is a churchman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god will respect his profession , and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at what hour? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired a turnkey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , about ten or eleven o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of what use would it be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shut the dungeon as if he were alivethat is all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he raised the flag - stone cautiously with his head , and looked carefully around the chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was empty , and dants emerged from the tunnel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the bed , at full length , and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window , lay a sack of canvas , and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form; it was faria s last winding - sheet ,a winding - sheet which , as the turnkey said , cost so little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything was in readiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a barrier had been placed between dants and his old friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no longer could edmond look into those wide - open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death; no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria , the beneficent and cheerful companion , with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately , no longer breathed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed , and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alone! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was alone again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again condemned to silenceagain face to face with nothingness! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alone! never again to see the face , never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was not faria s fate the better , after allto solve the problem of life at its source , even at the risk of horrible suffering? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the idea of suicide , which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence , now hovered like a phantom over the abb s dead body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i could die , he said ,  - i should go where he goes , and should assuredly find him again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is very easy , he went on with a smile;  - i will remain here , rush on the first person that opens the door , strangle him , and then they will guillotine me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but excessive grief is like a storm at sea , where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - die? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , no , he exclaimed - not die now , after having lived and suffered so long and so much! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> die? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , had i died years ago; but now to die would be , indeed , to give way to the sarcasm of destiny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , i want to live; i shall struggle to the very last; i will yet win back the happiness of which i have been deprived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet they will forget me here , and i shall die in my dungeon like faria . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he said this , he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it from thee? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without giving himself time to reconsider his decision , and , indeed , that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution , he bent over the appalling shroud , opened it with the knife which faria had made , drew the corpse from the sack , and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber , laid it on his couch , tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own , covered it with his counterpane , once again kissed the ice - cold brow , and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes , which glared horribly , turned the head towards the wall , so that the jailer might , when he brought the evening meal , believe that he was asleep , as was his frequent custom; entered the tunnel again , drew the bed against the wall , returned to the other cell , took from the hiding - place the needle and thread , flung off his rags , that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas , and getting inside the sack , placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid , and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart , if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants might have waited until the evening visit was over , but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind , and order the dead body to be removed earlier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now his plans were fully made , and this is what he intended to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if while he was being carried out the grave - diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body , dants did not intend to give them time to recognize him , but with a sudden cut of the knife , he meant to open the sack from top to bottom , and , profiting by their alarm , escape; if they tried to catch him , he would use his knife to better purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave , he would allow himself to be covered with earth , and then , as it was night , the grave - diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy , he would be stifled , and thenso much the better , all would be over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants had not eaten since the preceding evening , but he had not thought of hunger , nor did he think of it now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual , but speak to dants , and seeing that he received no reply , go to the bed , and thus discover all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when seven o clock came , dants  agony really began . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings , while , with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance , and dants knew that he had escaped the first peril . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a good augury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond felt that the moment had arrived , summoned up all his courage , held his breath , and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the footstepsthey were doublepaused at the doorand dants guessed that the two grave - diggers had come to seek himthis idea was soon converted into certainty , when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand - bier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door opened , and a dim light reached dants  eyes through the coarse sack that covered him; he saw two shadows approach his bed , a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two men , approaching the ends of the bed , took the sack by its extremities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you tied the knot? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the first speaker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was the reply ,  - i can do that when we get there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , you re right , replied the companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thought dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man , and then the party , lighted by the man with the torch , who went first , ascended the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air , and dants knew that the mistral was blowing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of them went away , and dants heard his shoes striking on the pavement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really , he is by no means a light load! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the other bearer , sitting on the edge of the hand - barrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants  first impulse was to escape , but fortunately he did not attempt it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give us a light , said the other bearer ,  - or i shall never find what i am looking for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man with the torch complied , although not asked in the most polite terms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what can he be looking for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the spade , perhaps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here it is at last , he said ,  - not without some trouble , though . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , was the answer ,  - but it has lost nothing by waiting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , have you tied the knot? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the grave - digger , who was looking on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , and pretty tight too , i can tell you , was the answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - move on , then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the bier was lifted once more , and they proceeded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they advanced fifty paces farther , and then stopped to open a door , then went forward again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the chteau is built , reached dants  ear distinctly as they went forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bad weather! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> observed one of the bearers;  - not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , yes , the abb runs a chance of being wet , said the other; and then there was a burst of brutal laughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants did not comprehend the jest , but his hair stood erect on his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know very well that the last was stopped on his way , dashed on the rocks , and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they ascended five or six more steps , and then dants felt that they took him , one by the head and the other by the heels , and swung him to and fro . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the grave - diggers ,  - two! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent , it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last , with a horrible splash , he darted like an arrow into the ice - cold water , and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry , stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sea is the cemetery of the chteau d if . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants , although stunned and almost suffocated , had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath , and as his right hand ( prepared as he was for every chance ) held his knife open , he rapidly ripped up the sack , extricated his arm , and then his body; but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot , he felt it dragging him down still lower . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea , while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he arose a second time , he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky , across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters , sombre and terrible , whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind him , blacker than the sea , blacker than the sky , rose phantom - like the vast stone structure , whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey , and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea; doubtless these strange grave - diggers had heard his cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was an easy feat to him , for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there , and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he came up again the light had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ratonneau and pomgue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the chteau d if , but ratonneau and pomgue are inhabited , as is also the islet of daume . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for dants  venture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the chteau d if; dants , nevertheless , determined to make for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by leaving this light on the right , he kept the island of tiboulen a little on the left; by turning to the left , therefore , he would find it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> often in prison faria had said to him , when he saw him idle and inactive: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dants , you must not give way to this listlessness; you will be drowned if you seek to escape , and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power , and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fear , that relentless pursuer , clogged dants  efforts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he swam on still , and already the terrible chteau had disappeared in the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not see it , but he felt its presence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an hour passed , during which dants , excited by the feeling of freedom , continued to cleave the waves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what if i were mistaken? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a shudder passed over him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sought to tread water , in order to rest himself; but the sea was too violent , and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense , and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he put out his hand , and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks , that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the island of tiboulen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants rose , advanced a few steps , and , with a fervent prayer of gratitude , stretched himself on the granite , which seemed to him softer than down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent , lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants had not been deceivedhe had reached the first of the two islands , which was , in fact , tiboulen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter , and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves , dashing themselves against it , wetted him with their spray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed to him that the island trembled to its base , and that it would , like a vessel at anchor , break moorings , and bear him off into the centre of the storm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four - and - twenty hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he extended his hands , and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he rose , a flash of lightning , that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven , illumined the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by its light , between the island of lemaire and cape croiselle , a quarter of a league distant , dants saw a fishing - boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a second after , he saw it again , approaching with frightful rapidity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger , but they saw it themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging , while a fifth clung to the broken rudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way , and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea - bird . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces; he listened , he groped about , but he heard and saw nothingthe cries had ceased , and the tempest continued to rage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by degrees the wind abated , vast gray clouds rolled towards the west , and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle , as if he now beheld it for the first time; and indeed since his captivity in the chteau d if he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned towards the fortress , and looked at both sea and land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was about five o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sea continued to get calmer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in two or three hours , thought dants ,  - the turnkey will enter my chamber , find the body of my poor friend , recognize it , seek for me in vain , and give the alarm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the police of marseilles will be on the alert by land , whilst the governor pursues me by sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am cold , i am hungry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , my god , i have suffered enough surely! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as dants ( his eyes turned in the direction of the chteau d if ) uttered this prayer , he saw off the farther point of the island of pomgue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey; and with his sailor s eye he knew it to be a genoese tartan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was coming out of marseilles harbor , and was standing out to sea rapidly , her sharp prow cleaving through the waves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , cried edmond ,  - to think that in half an hour i could join her , did i not fear being questioned , detected , and conveyed back to marseilles! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what can i do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what story can i invent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must wait . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i cannoti am starving . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted; besides , perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke , dants looked toward the spot where the fishing - vessel had been wrecked , and started . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in an instant dants  plan was formed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he swam to the cap , placed it on his head , seized one of the timbers , and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am saved! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and this conviction restored his strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he soon saw that the vessel , with the wind dead ahead , was tacking between the chteau d if and the tower of planier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for an instant he feared lest , instead of keeping in shore , she should stand out to sea; but he soon saw that she would pass , like most vessels bound for italy , between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another , and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he rose on the waves , making signs of distress; but no one on board saw him , and the vessel stood on another tack . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants would have shouted , but he knew that the wind would drown his voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber , for without it he would have been unable , perhaps , to reach the vesselcertainly to return to shore , should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he advanced; but before they could meet , the vessel again changed her course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by a violent effort he rose half out of the water , waving his cap , and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time he was both seen and heard , and the tartan instantly steered towards him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an instant after , the boat , rowed by two men , advanced rapidly towards him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants let go of the timber , which he now thought to be useless , and swam vigorously to meet them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his arms became stiff , his legs lost their flexibility , and he was almost breathless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two sailors redoubled their efforts , and one of them cried in italian ,  - courage! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the water passed over his head , and the sky turned gray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt himself seized by the hair , then he saw and heard nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had fainted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he opened his eyes dants found himself on the deck of the tartan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his first care was to see what course they were taking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were rapidly leaving the chteau d if behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as we have said , he was lying on the deck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> held a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while the third , an old sailor , at once the pilot and captain , looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday , and which may overtake them tomorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the pilot in bad french . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am , replied dants , in bad italian ,  - a maltese sailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we were coming from syracuse laden with grain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw your vessel , and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island , i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have saved my life , and i thank you , continued dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was i , said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance;  - and it was time , for you were sinking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , returned dants , holding out his hand ,  - i thank you again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i almost hesitated , though , replied the sailor;  - you looked more like a brigand than an honest man , with your beard six inches , and your hair a foot long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said he ,  - i made a vow , to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if i were saved in a moment of danger; but today the vow expires . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now what are we to do with you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , anything you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my captain is dead; i have barely escaped; but i am a good sailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leave me at the first port you make; i shall be sure to find employment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have sailed over it since my childhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know the best harbors? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i say , captain , said the sailor who had cried  - courage! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to dants ,  - if what he says is true , what hinders his staying with us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if he says true , said the captain doubtingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but in his present condition he will promise anything , and take his chance of keeping it afterwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we shall see , returned the other , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where are you going? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to leghorn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then why , instead of tacking so frequently , do you not sail nearer the wind? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because we should run straight on to the island of rion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you shall pass it by twenty fathoms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take the helm , and let us see what you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to the sheets , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the four seamen , who composed the crew , obeyed , while the pilot looked on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they obeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - belay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this order was also executed; and the vessel passed , as dants had predicted , twenty fathoms to windward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated the sailors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you do not want me at leghorn , you can leave me there , and i will pay you out of the first wages i get , for my food and the clothes you lend me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give me what you give the others , and it will be all right , returned dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s not fair , said the seaman who had saved dants;  - for you know more than we do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is that to you , jacopo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> returned the captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - everyone is free to ask what he pleases . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s true , replied jacopo;  - i only make a remark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers , if you have them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said jacopo;  - but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond wanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , then , do you wish for anything else? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the patron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum i tasted , for i have not eaten or drunk for a long time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - larboard your helm , cried the captain to the steersman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in mid - air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what s the matter at the chteau d if? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a small white cloud , which had attracted dants  attention , crowned the summit of the bastion of the chteau d if . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sailors looked at one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a prisoner has escaped from the chteau d if , and they are firing the alarm gun , replied dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pretty strong rum! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said dants , wiping his brow with his sleeve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at any rate , murmured he ,  - if it be , so much the better , for i have made a rare acquisition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> under pretence of being fatigued , dants asked to take the helm; the steersman , glad to be relieved , looked at the captain , and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants could thus keep his eyes on marseilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the day of the month? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he of jacopo , who sat down beside him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the 28th of february . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in what year? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the young man ,  - i ask you in what year! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have forgotten then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i got such a fright last night , replied dants , smiling ,  - that i have almost lost my memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was fourteen years , day for day , since dants  arrest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a sorrowful smile passed over his face; he asked himself what had become of mercds , who must believe him dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without having been in the school of the abb faria , the worthy master of la jeune amlie ( the name of the genoese tartan ) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean , from the arabic to the provenal , and this , while it spared him interpreters , persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet , gave him great facilities of communication , either with the vessels he met at sea , with the small boats sailing along the coast , or with the people without name , country , or occupation , who are always seen on the quays of seaports , and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence , as they have no visible means of support . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at first the captain had received dants on board with a certain degree of distrust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the skilful manner in which dants had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him; and then , when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the chteau d if , and heard the distant report , he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going , like that of kings , was accompanied with salutes of artillery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this made him less uneasy , it must be owned , than if the new - comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first , when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was , without the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to  - pump him , they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta , which he knew as well as marseilles , and held stoutly to his first story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus the genoese , subtle as he was , was duped by edmond , in whose favor his mild demeanor , his nautical skill , and his admirable dissimulation , pleaded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know , and believe nothing but what they should believe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this state of mutual understanding , they reached leghorn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself , as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he had twenty times touched at leghorn , he remembered a barber in st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the leghorn barber said nothing and went to work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the operation was concluded , and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth , and his hair reduced to its usual length , he asked for a looking - glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was now , as we have said , three - and - thirty years of age , and his fourteen years  imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was now all changed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , from being so long in twilight or darkness , his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night , common to the hyena and the wolf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was impossible that his best friendif , indeed , he had any friend leftcould recognize him; he could not recognize himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the master of la jeune amlie , who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of edmond s value , had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits , which edmond had accepted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his next care on leaving the barber s who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor s suita garb , as we all know , very simple , and consisting of white trousers , a striped shirt , and a cap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was in this costume , and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him , that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger , who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him , or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard , hair tangled with seaweed , and body soaking in seabrine , whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> attracted by his prepossessing appearance , he renewed his offers of an engagement to dants; but dants , who had his own projects , would not agree for a longer time than three months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> la jeune amlie had a very active crew , very obedient to their captain , who lost as little time as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the master was to get all this out of leghorn free of duties , and land it on the shores of corsica , where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they sailed; edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth , and which he had so often dreamed of in prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left , and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the island of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> la jeune amlie left it three - quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants thought , as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him , that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure , without arms to defend himself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , what would the sailors say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what would the patron think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he must wait . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , were not those riches chimerical? offspring of the brain of the poor abb faria , had they not died with him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true , the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial , and dants repeated it to himself , from one end to the other , for he had not forgotten a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> evening came , and edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight , and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own , for he , with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison , continued to behold it last of all , for he remained alone upon deck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants noticed that the captain of la jeune amlie had , as he neared the land , mounted two small culverins , which , without making much noise , can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger , which , no doubt , in acknowledgement of the compliment , lowered her own shallop into the sea , and the five boats worked so well that by two o clock in the morning all the cargo was out of la jeune amlie and on terra firma . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same night , such a man of regularity was the patron of la jeune amlie , the profits were divided , and each man had a hundred tuscan livres , or about eighty francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the voyage was not ended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia , where they intended to take in a cargo , which was to replace what had been discharged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the excise was , in truth , the everlasting enemy of the patron of la jeune amlie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants was almost glad of this affray , and almost pleased at being wounded , for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger , and with what endurance he could bear suffering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had contemplated danger with a smile , and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher ,  - pain , thou art not an evil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had , moreover , looked upon the customs officer wounded to death , and , whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter , or the chill of human sentiment , this sight had made but slight impression upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants was on the way he desired to follow , and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jacopo , seeing him fall , had believed him killed , and rushing towards him raised him up , and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fortunately , as we have said , edmond was only wounded , and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons , and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian women , the wound soon closed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond then resolved to try jacopo , and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize - money , but jacopo refused it indignantly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this sufficed for jacopo , who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of positiona superiority which edmond had concealed from all others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast , explained to him the variations of the compass , and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven , and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when jacopo inquired of him ,  - what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond replied ,  - who knows? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you may one day be the captain of a vessel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your fellow - countryman , bonaparte , became emperor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then formed a resolution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he would be free to make his researches , not perhaps entirely at liberty , for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in this world we must risk something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> prison had made edmond prudent , and he was desirous of running no risk whatever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in vain did he rack his imagination; fertile as it was , he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> already dants had visited this maritime bourse two or three times , and seeing all these hardy free - traders , who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent , he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time it was a great matter that was under discussion , connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets , stuffs of the levant , and cashmeres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made , and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous , there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the mention of monte cristo dants started with joy; he rose to conceal his emotion , and took a turn around the smoky tavern , where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter , it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond , being consulted , was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security , and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , at length , by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny , dants was about to secure the opportunity he wished for , by simple and natural means , and land on the island without incurring any suspicion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one night more and he would be on his way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the night was one of feverish distraction , and in its progress visions , good and evil , passed through dants  mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pearls fell drop by drop , as subterranean waters filter in their caves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all was useless , the treasure disappeared , and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day came at length , and was almost as feverish as the night had been , but it brought reason to the aid of imagination , and dants was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> night came , and with it the preparation for departure , and these preparations served to conceal dants  agitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always clear , distinct , and easy of execution , his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at seven o clock in the evening all was ready , and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sea was calm , and , with a fresh breeze from the south - east , they sailed beneath a bright blue sky , in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon lights , each of which is a world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants , cast from solitude into the world , frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude; and what solitude is more complete , or more poetical , than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night , in the silence of immensity , and under the eye of heaven? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts , the night lighted up by his illusions , and the silence animated by his anticipations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the patron awoke , the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set , and every sail full with the breeze . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were making nearly ten knots an hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond resigned the lugger to the master s care , and went and lay down in his hammock; but , in spite of a sleepless night , he could not close his eyes for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two hours afterwards he came on deck , as the boat was about to double the island of elba . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun , was seen against the azure sky . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants ordered the helmsman to put down his helm , in order to leave la pianosa to starboard , as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about five o clock in the evening the island was distinct , and everything on it was plainly perceptible , owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors , from the brightest pink to the deepest blue; and from time to time his cheeks flushed , his brow darkened , and a mist passed over his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never did a gamester , whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die , experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> night came , and at ten o clock they anchored . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> la jeune amlie was first at the rendezvous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in spite of his usual command over himself , dants could not restrain his impetuosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was the first to jump on shore; and had he dared , he would , like lucius brutus , have  - kissed his mother earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was dark , but at eleven o clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean , whose every wave she silvered , and then ,  - ascending high , played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second pelion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the island was familiar to the crew of la jeune amlie ,it was one of her regular haunts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he questioned jacopo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where shall we pass the night? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he inquired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , on board the tartan , replied the sailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , the grottoscaves of the island . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know of any grottos , replied jacopo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cold sweat sprang forth on dants  brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , are there no grottos at monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - none . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the point was , then , to discover the hidden entrance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was useless to search at night , and dants therefore delayed all investigation until the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , a signal made half a league out at sea , and to which la jeune amlie replied by a similar signal , indicated that the moment for business had come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boat that now arrived , assured by the answering signal that all was well , soon came in sight , white and silent as a phantom , and cast anchor within a cable s length of shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants reflected , as he worked , on the shout of joy which , with a single word , he could evoke from all these men , if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart; but , far from disclosing this precious secret , he almost feared that he had already said too much , and by his restlessness and continual questions , his minute observations and evident preoccupation , aroused suspicions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fortunately , as regarded this circumstance at least , his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness , and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one had the slightest suspicion; and when next day , taking a fowling - piece , powder , and shot , dants declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock , his wish was construed into a love of sport , or a desire for solitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , jacopo insisted on following him , and dants did not oppose this , fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this and some dried fruits and a flask of monte pulciano , was the bill of fare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants went on , looking from time to time behind and around about him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having reached the summit of a rock , he saw , a thousand feet beneath him , his companions , whom jacopo had rejoined , and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmond s skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment hope makes me despise their riches , which seem to me contemptible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me , that i shall , on compulsion , consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed edmond ,  - that will not be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wise , unerring faria could not be mistaken in this one thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus dants , who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough , and panted for wealth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile , by a cleft between two walls of rock , following a path worn by a torrent , and which , in all human probability , human foot had never before trod , dants approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle , which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms , or beneath parasitical lichen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide - marks were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only , might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed , however , to edmond , who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground , that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a large round rock , placed solidly on its base , was the only spot to which they seemed to lead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning , and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast , had got some water from a spring , spread out the fruit and bread , and cooked the kid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit , they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock , and they fired the signal agreed upon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sportsman instantly changed his direction , and ran quickly towards them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but even while they watched his daring progress , edmond s foot slipped , and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they all rushed towards him , for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority; yet jacopo reached him first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond opened his eyes , complained of great pain in his knee , a feeling of heaviness in his head , and severe pains in his loins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they wished to carry him to the shore; but when they touched him , although under jacopo s directions , he declared , with heavy groans , that he could not bear to be moved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for himself , he declared that he had only need of a little rest , and that when they returned he should be easier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sailors did not require much urging . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were hungry , and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory , and your tars are not very ceremonious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an hour afterwards they returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss - grown rock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond made great exertions in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back , moaning and turning pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has broken his ribs , said the commander , in a low voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no matter; he is an excellent fellow , and we must not leave him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will try and carry him on board the tartan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants declared , however , that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the patron ,  - let what may happen , it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will not go till evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise , or even delay in its execution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leave me a small supply of biscuit , a gun , powder , and balls , to kill the kids or defend myself at need , and a pickaxe , that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you ll die of hunger , said the patron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would rather do so , was edmond s reply ,  - than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the patron turned towards his vessel , which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor , and , with sails partly set , would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what are we to do , maltese? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we cannot leave you here so , and yet we cannot stay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go , go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we shall be absent at least a week , said the patron ,  - and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , said dants ,  - if in two or three days you hail any fishing - boat , desire them to come here to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you do not come across one , return for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the patron shook his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and give up your share of the venture , said edmond ,  - to remain with me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said jacopo ,  - and without any hesitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are a good fellow and a kind - hearted messmate , replied edmond ,  - and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions; but i do not wish anyone to stay with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a peculiar smile passed over dants  lips; he squeezed jacopo s hand warmly , but nothing could shake his determination to remainand remain alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail , but not without turning about several times , and each time making signs of a cordial farewell , to which edmond replied with his hand only , as if he could not move the rest of his body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , when they had disappeared , he said with a smile , -  tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock , from which he had a full view of the sea , and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing , weigh anchor , and , balancing herself as gracefully as a water - fowl ere it takes to the wing , set sail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now , he exclaimed , remembering the tale of the arabian fisherman , which faria had related to him ,  - now , open sesame! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sun had nearly reached the meridian , and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks , which seemed themselves sensible of the heat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thousands of grasshoppers , hidden in the bushes , chirped with a monotonous and dull note; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at every step that edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald; afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dreadthat dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was not upon corsica , the very houses of which he could distinguish; or on sardinia; or on the island of elba , with its historical associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud , and leghorn the commercial , that he gazed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw that he was on the highest point of the island ,a statue on this vast pedestal of granite , nothing human appearing in sight , while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island , and covered it with a fringe of foam . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he descended with cautious and slow step , for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants , as we have said , had traced the marks along the rocks , and he had noticed that they led to a small creek , which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth , and deep in the centre , to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class , which would be perfectly concealed from observation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then following the clew that , in the hands of the abb faria , had been so skilfully used to guide him through the ddalian labyrinth of probabilities , he thought that the cardinal spada , anxious not to be watched , had entered the creek , concealed his little barque , followed the line marked by the notches in the rock , and at the end of it had buried his treasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was this idea that had brought dants back to the circular rock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one thing only perplexed edmond , and destroyed his theory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how could this rock , which weighed several tons , have been lifted to this spot , without the aid of many men? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly an idea flashed across his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of raising it , thought he , they have lowered it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he soon perceived that a slope had been formed , and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the rock was too heavy , and too firmly wedged , to be moved by anyone man , were he hercules himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants saw that he must attack the wedge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but how? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cast his eyes around , and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he smiled; the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he lighted it and retired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the explosion soon followed; the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder; the lower one flew into pieces; thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dants had previously formed , and a huge snake , like the guardian demon of the treasure , rolled himself along in darkening coils , and disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the intrepid treasure - seeker walked round it , and , selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack , placed his lever in one of the crevices , and strained every nerve to move the mass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants redoubled his efforts; he seemed like one of the ancient titans , who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the spot it had occupied was a circular space , exposing an iron ring let into a square flag - stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would fain have continued , but his knees trembled , and his heart beat so violently , and his sight became so dim , that he was forced to pause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this feeling lasted but for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength; the flag - stone yielded , and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what , then , would be the use of all i have suffered? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the heart breaks when , after having been elated by flattering hopes , it sees all its illusions destroyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> faria has dreamed this; the cardinal spada buried no treasure here; perhaps he never came here , or if he did , csar borgia , the intrepid adventurer , the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer , has followed him , discovered his traces , pursued them as i have done , raised the stone , and descending before me , has left me nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained motionless and pensive , his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now that i expect nothing , now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes , the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he remained again motionless and thoughtful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , borgia has been here , a torch in one hand , a sword in the other , and within twenty paces , at the foot of this rock , perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea , while their master descended , as i am about to descend , dispelling the darkness before his awe - inspiring progress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked dants of himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the fate , replied he , smiling ,  - of those who buried alaric , and were interred with the corpse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yet , had he come , thought dants ,  - he would have found the treasure , and borgia , he who compared italy to an artichoke , which he could devour leaf by leaf , knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will go down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he descended , a smile on his lips , and murmuring that last word of human philosophy ,  - perhaps! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but instead of the darkness , and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find , dants saw a dim and bluish light , which , as well as the air , entered , not merely by the aperture he had just formed , but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without , and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks , and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after having stood a few minutes in the cavern , the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp , dants  eye , habituated as it was to darkness , could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern , which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he called to mind the words of the will , which he knew by heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the farthest angle of the second opening , said the cardinal s will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had only found the first grotto; he had now to seek the second . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants continued his search . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dants  forehead large drops of perspiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he again struck it , and with greater force . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he struck the wall , pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off , and fell to the ground in flakes , exposing a large white stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones , then this stucco had been applied , and painted to imitate granite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe , which entered someway between the interstices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but by some strange play of emotion , in proportion as the proofs that faria , had not been deceived became stronger , so did his heart give way , and a feeling of discouragement stole over him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants had tasted nothing , but he thought not of hunger at such a moment; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum , and again entered the cavern . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented , but had been merely placed one upon the other , and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of his pickaxe , and using the handle as a lever , with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges , and fall at his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had nothing more to do now , but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere , and then went on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to dants  eye there was no darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he glanced around this second grotto; it was , like the first , empty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the treasure , if it existed , was buried in this corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the time had at length arrived; two feet of earth removed , and dants  fate would be decided . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he advanced towards the angle , and summoning all his resolution , attacked the ground with the pickaxe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had dants found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he again struck his pickaxe into the earth , and encountered the same resistance , but not the same sound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening; dants seized his gun , sprang through the opening , and mounted the stair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave , and was feeding at a little distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner; but dants feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thought a moment , cut a branch of a resinous tree , lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast , and descended with this torch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he approached the hole he had dug , and now , with the aid of the torch , saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared , and dants could see an oaken coffer , bound with cut steel; in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate , which was still untarnished , the arms of the spada familyviz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , a sword , en pale , on an oval shield , like all the italian armorial bearings , and surmounted by a cardinal s hat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no longer any doubt: the treasure was thereno one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sought to open it; lock and padlock were fastened; these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid , and pressing with all his force on the handle , burst open the fastenings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hinges yielded in their turn and fell , still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood , and the chest was open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond was seized with vertigo; he cocked his gun and laid it beside him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament; then he re - opened them , and stood motionless with amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three compartments divided the coffer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first , blazed piles of golden coin; in the second , were ranged bars of unpolished gold , which possessed nothing attractive save their value; in the third , edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds , pearls , and rubies , which , as they fell on one another , sounded like hail against glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after having touched , felt , examined these treasures , edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy; he leaped on a rock , from whence he could behold the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was alonealone with these countless , these unheard - of treasures! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was he awake , or was it but a dream? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it a transient vision , or was he face to face with reality? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would fain have gazed upon his gold , and yet he had not strength enough; for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him , and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo , terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea - fowls with his wild cries and gestures; then he returned , and , still unable to believe the evidence of his senses , rushed into the grotto , and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time he fell on his knees , and , clasping his hands convulsively , uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he soon became calmer and more happy , for only now did he begin to realize his felicity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then set himself to work to count his fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were a thousand ingots of gold , each weighing from two to three pounds; then he piled up twenty - five thousand crowns , each worth about eighty francs of our money , and bearing the effigies of alexander vi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and his predecessors; and he saw that the complement was not half empty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls , diamonds , and other gems , many of which , mounted by the most famous workmen , were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants saw the light gradually disappear , and fearing to be surprised in the cavern , left it , his gun in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper , and he snatched a few hours  sleep , lying over the mouth of the cave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> descending into the grotto , he lifted the stone , filled his pockets with gems , put the box together as well and securely as he could , sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken , and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance; then , quitting the grotto , he replaced the stone , heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite , filling the interstices with earth , into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants , such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn , then carefully watering these new plantations , he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps , leaving the approach to the cavern as savage - looking and untrodden as he had found it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this done , he impatiently awaited the return of his companions . </s> </s>

<s> <s> upon the whole , however , the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned; while the crew , and particularly jacopo , expressed great regrets that dants had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits , which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> arrived at leghorn , he repaired to the house of a jew , a dealer in precious stones , to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present , which dants hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family , who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune , left him by an uncle , whose sole heir he was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the superior education of dants gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to jacopo to doubt its accuracy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on board la jeune amlie having expired , dants took leave of the captain , who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew , but having been told the history of the legacy , he ceased to importune him further . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the following morning jacopo set sail for marseilles , with directions from dants to join him at the island of monte cristo . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay; this yacht had been built by order of an englishman , who , having heard that the genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the mediterranean in the construction of fast - sailing vessels , was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between the englishman and the genoese builder was forty thousand francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants , struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel , applied to its owner to transfer it to him , offering sixty thousand francs , upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the proposal was too advantageous to be refused , the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland , and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month , by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a bargain was therefore struck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor , and upon their return the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel , but this dants declined with many thanks , saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone , and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed s head , the closet to contain three divisions , so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the builder cheerfully undertook the commission , and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day , dants furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two hours afterward dants sailed from the port of genoa , under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dants handled the helm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some insisted she was making for corsica , others the island of elba; bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain; while africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course; but no one thought of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet thither it was that dants guided his vessel , and at monte cristo he arrived at the close of the second day; his boat had proved herself a first - class sailor , and had come the distance from genoa in thirty - five hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore , and , instead of landing at the usual place , he dropped anchor in the little creek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the island was utterly deserted , and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away; his treasure was just as he had left it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches , and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a week passed by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants employed it in manuvring his yacht round the island , studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service , till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the former dants proposed to augment , the latter to remedy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching monte cristo . </s> </s>

<s> <s> his signal was returned , and in two hours afterwards the new - comer lay at anchor beside the yacht . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> old dants was dead , and mercds had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dants listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness; but , leaping lightly ashore , he signified his desire to be quite alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a couple of hours he returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two of the men from jacopo s boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it , and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles . </s> </s>

<s> <s> still dants could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore; but with that perfect self - possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with faria , dants coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn , and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded , he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first person to attract the attention of dants , as he landed on the canebire , was one of the crew belonging to the pharaon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellowwho had been one of his own sailorsas a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> going straight towards him , he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects , carefully watching the man s countenance as he did so; but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility , dants proceeded onwards; but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i see that i have made a trifling mistake , as you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon , that you may drink to my health , and be able to ask your messmates to join you . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles , from whence a full view of the alles de meilhan was obtained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this spot , so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances , his heart beat almost to bursting , his knees tottered under him , a mist floated over his sight , and had he not clung for support to one of the trees , he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there . </s> </s>

<s> <s> though answered in the negative , he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor , that , in despite of the oft - repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied , dants succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants , and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week; and seeing them , dants sighed heavily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dants; the very paper was different , while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmond s time had all disappeared; the four walls alone remained as he had left them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and , in spite of his efforts to prevent it , the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last , vainly calling for his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor s emotion , and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features; but they felt the sacredness of his grief , and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause , while , with instinctive delicacy , they left him to indulge his sorrow alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections , they both accompanied him downstairs , reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased , and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor , he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there; but he received for reply , that the person in question had got into difficulties , and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the alles de meilhan belonged , dants next proceeded thither , and , under the name of lord wilmore ( the name and title inscribed on his passport ) , purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty - five thousand francs , at least ten thousand more than it was worth; but had its owner asked half a million , it would unhesitatingly have been given . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house , now become the property of dants , were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds , etc . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house , without the least augmentation of rent , upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what raised public astonishment to a climax , and set all conjecture at defiance , was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the alles de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans , and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman s hut , and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present , consisting of an entirely new fishing - boat , with two seines and a tender . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor , but they had seen him , upon quitting the hut , merely give some orders to a sailor , and then springing lightly on horseback , leave marseilles by the porte d aix . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this modern place of entertainment stood on the left - hand side of the post road , and backed upon the rhne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden , consisting of a small plot of ground , on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few dingy olives and stunted fig - trees struggled hard for existence , but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic , tomatoes , and eschalots; while , lone and solitary , like a forgotten sentinel , a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot , and displayed its flexible stem and fan - shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub - tropical sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the surrounding plain , which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground , were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat , the effect , no doubt , of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper , which regaled the passers - by through this egyptian scene with its strident , monotonous note . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and , as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper , whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing , it was situated between the rhne from which it had its source and the post - road it had depleted , not a hundred steps from the inn , of which we have given a brief but faithful description . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty - five years of age , tall , strong , and bony , a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes; he had dark , sparkling , and deep - set eyes , hooked nose , and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair , like his beard , which he wore under his chin , was thick and curly , and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door , on the lookout for guests who seldom came , yet there he stood , day after day , exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun , with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it , after the manner of the spanish muleteers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man was our old acquaintance , gaspard caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> born in the neighborhood of arles , she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she remained nearly always in her second - floor chamber , shivering in her chair , or stretched languid and feeble on her bed , while her husband kept his daily watch at the doora duty he performed with so much the greater willingness , as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate , who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate; to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply , in these philosophic words: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is god s pleasure that things should be so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village , so called , situated between salon and lambesc; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation , her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine , which , in all probability , his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence , the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits , and the daily infliction of his peevish partner s murmurs and lamentations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the days of his prosperity , not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , by degrees , watch - chains , necklaces , parti - colored scarves , embroidered bodices , velvet vests , elegantly worked stockings , striped gaiters , and silver buckles for the shoes , all disappeared; and gaspard caderousse , unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor , had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities , both for himself and wife , although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung , more for the shelter than the profit it afforded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand , with its sides bordered by tall , meagre trees , altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance , that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller , at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying , would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the horse was of hungarian breed , and ambled along at an easy pace . </s> </s>

<s> <s> availing himself of a handle that projected from a half - fallen door , he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief , from his pocket , wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow , then , advancing to the door , struck thrice with the end of his iron - shod stick . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor , and , with many bows and courteous smiles , the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter . </s> </s>

<s> <s> what refreshment can i offer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all i have is at his service . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes ,christian and surname are the same . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes; let me have a bottle of your best wine , and then , with your permission , we will resume our conversation from where we left off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as you please , sir , said caderousse , who , anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession , hastily raised a trap - door in the floor of the apartment they were in , which served both as parlor and kitchen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes , he found the abb seated upon a wooden stool , leaning his elbow on a table , while margotin , whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments , had crept up to him , and had established himself very comfortably between his knees , his long , skinny neck resting on his lap , while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller s face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the guest , as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - quite , quite alone , replied the man - or , at least , practically so , for my poor wife , who is the only person in the house besides myself , is laid up with illness , and unable to render me the least assistance , poor thing! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are married , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , sir , said caderousse with a sigh ,  - it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - such words as those belong to your profession , answered caderousse ,  - and you do well to repeat them; but , added he , with a bitter expression of countenance ,  - one is free to believe them or not , as one pleases . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what mean you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the first place , i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search of . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - dants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed caderousse , whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abb fixed on him , while the clear , calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you remind me , said the priest ,  - that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - said to bear the name! </s> </s>

<s> <s> is he alive and at liberty? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse , who turned away , and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor fellow , poor fellow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , there , sir , is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth , and that none but the wicked prosper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , continued caderousse , speaking in the highly colored language of the south ,  - the world grows worse and worse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why does not god , if he really hates the wicked , as he is said to do , send down brimstone and fire , and consume them altogether? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i swear to you , sir , i swear to you , by everything a man holds dear , i have , since then , deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a brief silence , during which the fixed , searching eye of the abb was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you knew the poor lad , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continued caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was called to see him on his dying bed , that i might administer to him the consolations of religion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and of what did he die? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked caderousse in a choking voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of what , think you , do young and strong men die in prison , when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year , unless it be of imprisonment? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how should he have been otherwise? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , sir , the poor fellow told you the truth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and here the look of the abb , becoming more and more fixed , seemed to rest with ill - concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a rich englishman , continued the abb ,  - who had been his companion in misfortune , but had been released from prison during the second restoration , was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he bestowed on dants upon himself quitting the prison , as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dants had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers , who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor , dants carefully preserved it , that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live , for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , everything is relative , answered the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to one in edmond s position the diamond certainly was of great value . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was estimated at fifty thousand francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bless me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed caderousse ,  - fifty thousand francs! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sharp gaze of caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest s garments , as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen , the abb opened it , and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained , set in a ring of admirable workmanship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that diamond , cried caderousse , almost breathless with eager admiration ,  - you say , is worth fifty thousand francs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is , without the setting , which is also valuable , replied the abb , as he closed the box , and returned it to his pocket , while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did edmond make you his heir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i once possessed four dear and faithful friends , besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed  he said; and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the name of one of the four friends is caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - another of the number ,  continued the abb , without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse ,  - is called danglars; and the third , in spite of being my rival , entertained a very sincere affection for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mercds , said caderousse eagerly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , said the abb , with a stifled sigh ,  - mercds it was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on , urged caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bring me a carafe of water , said the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse quickly performed the stranger s bidding; and after pouring some into a glass , and slowly swallowing its contents , the abb , resuming his usual placidity of manner , said , as he placed his empty glass on the table: </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - because the fifth is dead , as i hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - too true , too true! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ejaculated caderousse , almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him ,  - the poor old man did die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i learned so much at marseilles , replied the abb , making a strong effort to appear indifferent;  - but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder dants , i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can you enlighten me on that point? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know who could if i could not , said caderousse . </s> </s>

<s> <s> ah , yes , about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of what did he die? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , the doctors called his complaint gastro - enteritis , i believe; his acquaintances say he died of grief; but i , who saw him in his dying moments , i say he died of<s> <s> caderousse paused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the priest , anxiously and eagerly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - starvation! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the abb , springing from his seat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man , a christian , should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians , is too horrible for belief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , it is impossible! utterly impossible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what i have said , i have said , answered caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you are a fool for having said anything about it , said a voice from the top of the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why should you meddle with what does not concern you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mind your own business , wife , replied caderousse sharply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this gentleman asks me for information , which common politeness will not permit me to refuse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - politeness , you simpleton! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> retorted la carconte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what have you to do with politeness , i should like to know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> better study a little common prudence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , that s all very fine , retorted the woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear; but when poor , silly folks , like my husband there , have been persuaded to tell all they know , the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it , behold trouble and misery , and all sorts of persecutions , are heaped on the unfortunate wretches , who cannot even see whence all their afflictions come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , nay , my good woman , make yourself perfectly easy , i beg of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whatever evils may befall you , they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality , that i solemnly promise you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again the abb had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had sufficiently recovered himself , he said ,  - it appears , then , that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> surely , had not such been the case , he would not have perished by so dreadful a death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gaspard , gaspard! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured the woman , from her seat on the stairs ,  - mind what you are saying! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse made no reply to these words , though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption , but , addressing the abb , said ,  - can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but dants was so honorable and true in his own nature , that he believed everybody s professions of friendship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor edmond , he was cruelly deceived; but it was fortunate that he never knew , or he might have found it more difficult , when on his deathbed , to pardon his enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , whatever people may say , continued caderousse , in his native language , which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry ,  - i cannot help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - imbecile! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you , then , know in what manner fernand injured dants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gaspard! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried la carconte ,  - do as you will; you are masterbut if you take my advice you ll hold your tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , wife , replied caderousse ,  - i don t know but what you re right! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so you will say nothing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if the poor lad were living , and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends , why , perhaps , i should not hesitate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but you tell me he is no more , and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge , so let all such feeling be buried with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is true enough , returned caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are these persons , then , so rich and powerful? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray relate it to me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my first business will be to dispose of this diamond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , the abb again drew the small box from his pocket , opened it , and contrived to hold it in such a light , that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wife , wife! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed la carconte , rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step;  - what diamond are you talking about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , did you not hear all we said? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , what a magnificent jewel! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the astonished woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then , does it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it does , replied the abb;  - with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dants , which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery , perhaps crime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and danglars , in order that i may execute edmond s last wishes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the agitation of caderousse became extreme , and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , you see , wife , said the former ,  - this splendid diamond might all be ours , if we chose! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for my part , i wash my hands of the affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber , her body convulsed with chills , and her teeth rattling in her head , in spite of the intense heat of the weather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> arrived at the top stair , she turned round , and called out , in a warning tone , to her husband ,  - gaspard , consider well what you are about to do! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have both reflected and decided , answered he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , asked the abb , as he returned to the apartment below ,  - what have you made up your mind to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to tell you all i know , was the reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope it may be so , replied caderousse , his face flushed with cupidity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am all attention , said the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stop a minute , answered caderousse;  - we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story , which would be a pity; and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during this time the abb had chosen his place for listening at his ease . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he removed his seat into a corner of the room , where he himself would be in deep shadow , while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator; then , with head bent down and hands clasped , or rather clenched together , he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse , who seated himself on the little stool , exactly opposite to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - enough , enough! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied caderousse;  - say no more about it; i will take all the consequences upon myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he began his story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first , sir , said caderousse ,  - you must make me a promise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , if you ever make use of the details i am about to give you , that you will never let anyone know that it was i who supplied them; for the persons of whom i am about to talk are rich and powerful , and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me , i should break to pieces like glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - make yourself easy , my friend , replied the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am a priest , and confessions die in my breast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> recollect , our only desire is to carry out , in a fitting manner , the last wishes of our friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> speak , then , without reserve , as without hatred; tell the truth , the whole truth; i do not know , never may know , the persons of whom you are about to speak; besides , i am an italian , and not a frenchman , and belong to god , and not to man , and i shall shortly retire to my convent , which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the abb;  - edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the history is a sad one , sir , said caderousse , shaking his head;  - perhaps you know all the earlier part of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> answered the abb;  - edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending; a police commissary , followed by four soldiers , entered , and dants was arrested . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , and up to this point i know all , said the priest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the next day mercds came to implore the protection of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort; she did not obtain it , however , and went to visit the old man; when she saw him so miserable and heart - broken , having passed a sleepless night , and not touched food since the previous day , she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him; but the old man would not consent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , sir , replied caderousse ,  - we cannot console those who will not be consoled , and he was one of these; besides , i know not why , but he seemed to dislike seeing me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one night , however , i heard his sobs , and i could not resist my desire to go up to him , but when i reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot now repeat to you , sir , all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it was more than piety , it was more than grief , and i , who am no canter , and hate the jesuits , said then to myself , it is really well , and i am very glad that i have not any children; for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does , and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying , i should throw myself into the sea at once , for i could not bear it . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - poor father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from day to day he lived on alone , and more and more solitary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel and mercds came to see him , but his door was closed; and , although i was certain he was at home , he would not make any answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day , when , contrary to his custom , he had admitted mercds , and the poor girl , in spite of her own grief and despair , endeavored to console him , he said to her ,be assured , my dear daughter , he is dead; and instead of expecting him , it is he who is awaiting us; i am quite happy , for i am the oldest , and of course shall see him first . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - however well disposed a person may be , why , you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow , they make one melancholy; and so at last old dants was left all to himself , and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide; but i guessed what these bundles were , and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know this , because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for the first three days i heard him walking about as usual , but , on the fourth i heard nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i then resolved to go up to him at all risks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door was closed , but i looked through the keyhole , and saw him so pale and haggard , that believing him very ill , i went and told m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they both came immediately , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel bringing a doctor , and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels , and ordered him a limited diet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was there , too , and i never shall forget the old man s smile at this prescription . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from that time he received all who came; he had an excuse for not eating any more; the doctor had put him on a diet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the story interests you , does it not , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the abb ,  - it is very affecting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mercds came again , and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel went away , making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney - piece; but , availing himself of the doctor s order , the old man would not take any sustenance; at length ( after nine days of despair and fasting ) , the old man died , cursing those who had caused his misery , and saying to mercds , if you ever see my edmond again , tell him i die blessing him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you believe he died<s> <s>  - of hunger , sir , of hunger , said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am as certain of it as that we two are christians . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this was , indeed , a horrid event , said he in a hoarse voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the more so , sir , as it was men s and not god s doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me of those men , said the abb ,  - and remember too , he added in an almost menacing tone ,  - you have promised to tell me everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , therefore , who are these men who killed the son with despair , and the father with famine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> speak on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which of the two denounced him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> which was the real delinquent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - both , sir; one with a letter , and the other put it in the post . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and where was this letter written? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at la rserve , the day before the betrothal feast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , faria , faria , how well did you judge men and things! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand , that his writing might not be recognized , and fernand who put it in the post . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , exclaimed the abb suddenly ,  - you were there yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb saw he had overshot the mark , and he added quickly , - no one; but in order to have known everything so well , you must have been an eye - witness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , true! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse in a choking voice ,  - i was there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and did you not remonstrate against such infamy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the abb;  - if not , you were an accomplice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - next daynext day , sir , you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing , yet you said nothing , though you were present when dants was arrested . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , i was there , and very anxious to speak; but danglars restrained me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he should really be guilty ,  said he , and did really put in to the island of elba; if he is really charged with a letter for the bonapartist committee at paris , and if they find this letter upon him , those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was cowardly , i confess , but it was not criminal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , answered caderousse;  - and remorse preys on me night and day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i often ask pardon of god , i swear to you , because this action , the only one with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my life , is no doubt the cause of my abject condition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am expiating a moment of selfishness , and so i always say to la carconte , when she complains , hold your tongue , woman; it is the will of god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , sir , said the abb ,  - you have spoken unreservedly; and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unfortunately , edmond is dead , and has not pardoned me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a brief silence; the abb rose and paced up and down pensively , and then resumed his seat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have two or three times mentioned a m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the owner of the pharaon and patron of dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what part did he play in this sad drama? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the part of an honest man , full of courage and real regard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twenty times he interceded for edmond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the emperor returned , he wrote , implored , threatened , and so energetically , that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in that case , replied the abb ,  - he should be a man blessed of god , rich , happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse smiled bitterly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel unhappy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is reduced almost to the last extremitynay , he is almost at the point of dishonor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , continued caderousse ,  - so it is; after five - and - twenty years of labor , after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of marseilles , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships in two years , has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses , and his only hope now is in that very pharaon which poor dants commanded , and which is expected from the indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if this ship founders , like the others , he is a ruined man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and has the unfortunate man wife or children? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains , and there would be an end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - horrible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ejaculated the priest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see , i , who never did a bad action but that i have told you ofam in destitution , with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes , and i unable to do anything in the world for her; i shall die of hunger , as old dants did , while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because their deeds have brought them good fortune , while honest men have been reduced to misery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what has become of danglars , the instigator , and therefore the most guilty? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what has become of him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , he left marseilles , and was taken , on the recommendation of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , who did not know his crime , as cashier into a spanish bank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de servieux , the king s chamberlain , who is in high favor at court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is a millionaire , and they have made him a baron , and now he is the baron danglars , with a fine residence in the rue du mont - blanc , with ten horses in his stables , six footmen in his antechamber , and i know not how many millions in his strongbox . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the abb , in a peculiar tone ,  - he is happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - happy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and fernand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , much the same story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but how could a poor catalan fisher - boy , without education or resources , make a fortune? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and it has staggered everybody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , then , by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - both , sirhe has both fortune and positionboth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this must be impossible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it would seem so; but listen , and you will understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some days before the return of the emperor , fernand was drafted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans , but napoleon returned , a special levy was made , and fernand was compelled to join . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i went too; but as i was older than fernand , and had just married my poor wife , i was only sent to the coast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that same night the general was to go over to the english . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand was a spaniard , and being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow - countrymen , found danglars there , got on very intimate terms with him , won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces , received promises and made pledges on his own part , guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists , and , in fact , rendered such services in this brief campaign that , after the taking of trocadero , he was made colonel , and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - destiny! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> destiny! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the war with spain being ended , fernand s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout europe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> greece only had risen against turkey , and had begun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards athensit was the fashion to pity and support the greeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the french government , without protecting them openly , as you know , gave countenance to volunteer assistance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali pasha was killed , as you know , but before he died he recompensed the services of fernand by leaving him a considerable sum , with which he returned to france , when he was gazetted lieutenant - general . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so that now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so that now , continued caderousse ,  - he owns a magnificent houseno . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 27 , rue du helder , paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb opened his mouth , hesitated for a moment , then , making an effort at self - control , he said ,  - and mercdsthey tell me that she has disappeared? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - disappeared , said caderousse ,  - yes , as the sun disappears , to rise the next day with still more splendor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the abb , with an ironical smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mercds is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in paris , replied caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i have seen things so extraordinary , that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have told you of her attempts to propitiate m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , her devotion to the elder dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the midst of her despair , a new affliction overtook her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was the departure of fernandof fernand , whose crime she did not know , and whom she regarded as her brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand went , and mercds remained alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one evening , after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to marseilles from the catalans , she returned to her home more depressed than ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly she heard a step she knew , turned anxiously around , the door opened , and fernand , dressed in the uniform of a sub - lieutenant , stood before her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was not the one she wished for most , but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , it must be confessed , fernand had never been hatedhe was only not precisely loved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another possessed all mercds  heart; that other was absent , had disappeared , perhaps was dead . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the old man died , as i have told you; had he lived , mercds , perchance , had not become the wife of another , for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand saw this , and when he learned of the old man s death he returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was now a lieutenant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at his first coming he had not said a word of love to mercds; at the second he reminded her that he loved her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he murmured the words of the english poet ,  - frailty , thy name is woman . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - six months afterwards , continued caderousse ,  - the marriage took place in the church of accoules . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the very church in which she was to have married edmond , murmured the priest;  - there was only a change of bridegrooms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fernand , more happy , but not more at his easefor i saw at this time he was in constant dread of edmond s returnfernand was very anxious to get his wife away , and to depart himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you ever see mercds again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , during the spanish war , at perpignan , where fernand had left her; she was attending to the education of her son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb started . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - her son? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied caderousse ,  - little albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , then , to be able to instruct her child , continued the abb ,  - she must have received an education herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman , beautiful but uneducated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , replied caderousse ,  - did he know so little of his lovely betrothed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds might have been a queen , sir , if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she learned drawing , musiceverything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , i believe , between ourselves , she did this in order to distract her mind , that she might forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now her position in life is assured , continued caderousse;  - no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her; she is rich , a countess , and yet<s> <s> caderousse paused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and yet what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what makes you believe this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , when i found myself utterly destitute , i thought my old friends would , perhaps , assist me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i called on fernand , who sent me a hundred francs by his valet - de - chambre . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you did not see either of them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , but madame de morcerf saw me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how was that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as i went away a purse fell at my feetit contained five - and - twenty louis; i raised my head quickly , and saw mercds , who at once shut the blind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , he never was a friend of mine , i did not know him , and i had nothing to ask of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you not know what became of him , and the share he had in edmond s misfortunes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; i only know that some time after edmond s arrest , he married mademoiselle de saint - mran , and soon after left marseilles; no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest; no doubt he is as rich as danglars , as high in station as fernand . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as he spoke , the abb took the diamond from his pocket , and giving it to caderousse , said ,  - here , my friend , take this diamond , it is yours . </s> </s>

<s> <s> cried caderousse ,  - ah , sir , do not jest with me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this diamond was to have been shared among his friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond had one friend only , and thus it cannot be divided . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , sir , said caderousse , putting out one hand timidly , and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow , - oh , sir , do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know what happiness and what despair are , and i never make a jest of such feelings . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - in exchange , he continued ,  - give me the red silk purse that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel left on old dants  chimney - piece , and which you tell me is still in your hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse , more and more astonished , went toward a large oaken cupboard , opened it , and gave the abb a long purse of faded red silk , round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you are a man of god , sir , cried caderousse;  - for no one knew that edmond had given you this diamond , and you might have kept it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which , said the abb to himself ,  - you would have done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb rose , took his hat and gloves . </s> </s>

<s> <s> adieu; i go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of caderousse , opened the door himself , got out and mounted his horse , once more saluted the innkeeper , who kept uttering his loud farewells , and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - is , then , all that i have heard really true? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she inquired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - false! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to get your secret without paying for it , you blockhead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in what way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , the fair is on at beaucaire , there are always jewellers from paris there , and i will show it to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fifty thousand francs! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> muttered la carconte when left alone;  - it is a large sum of money , but it is not a fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said he ,  - i am chief clerk of the house of thomson & french , of rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are , and have been these ten years , connected with the house of morrel & son , of marseilles . </s> </s>

<s> <s> 15 , rue de nouailles; he has , i believe , two hundred thousand francs in morrel s hands , and if there be any grounds for apprehension , as this is a greater amount than mine , you will most probably find him better informed than myself . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it looks more like bankruptcy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville despairingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the englishman appeared to reflect a moment , and then said ,  - from which it would appear , sir , that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , i will buy it of you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - no , for two hundred thousand francs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> a ray of joy passed across m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , i ought to tell you that , in all probability , you will not realize six per cent of this sum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s no affair of mine , replied the englishman ,  - that is the affair of the house of thomson & french , in whose name i act . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but all i know , sir , is , that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i only ask a brokerage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the commission is usually one and a half; will you have twothreefive per cent , or even more? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whatever you say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , replied the englishman , laughing ,  - i am like my house , and do not do such thingsno , the commission i ask is quite different . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i have been so these fourteen years . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there are special reports on every prisoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what was his name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , he was , decidedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he pretended to know of an immense treasure , and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor devil! and he is dead? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , five or six months ago , last february . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have a good memory , sir , to recollect dates so well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i recollect this , because the poor devil s death was accompanied by a singular incident . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may i ask what that was? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh dear , yes , sir; the abb s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of bonaparte s emissaries ,one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815 , a very resolute and very dangerous man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the englishman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it appears , sir , that this edmond dants had procured tools , or made them , for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners , the abb faria had an attack of catalepsy , and died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for the dead man , yes , replied m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville ,  - but not for the survivor; on the contrary , this dants saw a means of accelerating his escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was a bold step , and one that showed some courage , remarked the englishman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as i have already told you , sir , he was a very dangerous man; and , fortunately , by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how was that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you not comprehend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , they fastened a thirty - six - pound ball to his feet , and threw him into the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , continued the inspector of prisons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that would have been difficult . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no matter , replied de boville , in supreme good - humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs , - no matter , i can fancy it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he shouted with laughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and so , continued the englishman who first gained his composure ,  - he was drowned? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unquestionably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - precisely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the englishman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , the mortuary deposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you understand , dants  relations , if he had any , might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so that now , if there were anything to inherit from him , they may do so with easy conscience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is dead , and no mistake about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so be it , said the englishman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but to return to these registers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , this story has diverted our attention from them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the story? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by no means; it really seems to me very curious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , you will much oblige me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go into my study here , and i will show it to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville s study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything was here arranged in perfect order; each register had its number , each file of papers its place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair , and placed before him the register and documents relative to the chteau d if , giving him all the time he desired for the examination , while de boville seated himself in a corner , and began to read his newspaper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abb faria; but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly , for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there he found everything arranged in due order ,the accusation , examination , morrel s petition , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort s marginal notes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note , placed in a bracket against his name: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an inveterate bonapartist; took an active part in the return from the island of elba . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to be kept in strict solitary confinement , and to be closely watched and guarded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beneath these lines was written in another hand:  - see note abovenothing can be done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrel s petition , and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificatethat is to say , was in villefort s handwriting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to the note which accompanied this , the englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in dants  situation , but who had , from the remarks we have quoted , found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la rserve , and which had the postmark ,  - marseilles , 27th february , delivery 6 o clock , p . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it must be said that if he had seen it , he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper , and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs , that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do , however irregular it might be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thanks , said the latter , closing the register with a slam ,  - i have all i want; now it is for me to perform my promise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville , who took it without ceremony , and quickly drew up the required assignment , while the englishman counted out the bank - notes on the other side of the desk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anyone who had quitted marseilles a few years previously , well acquainted with the interior of morrel s warehouse , and had returned at this date , would have found a great change . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of that air of life , of comfort , and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishmentinstead of merry faces at the windows , busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridorsinstead of the court filled with bales of goods , re - echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters , one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office , but two remained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one was a young man of three or four - and - twenty , who was in love with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel s daughter , and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw; the other was an old one - eyed cashier , called  - cocles , or  - cock - eye , a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee - hive , and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not , in all probability , have replied to anyone who addressed him by it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel s service , and a most singular change had taken place in his position; he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier , and sunk to the rank of a servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel; and strong in the multiplication - table , which he had at his fingers  ends , no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this did not arise from a want of affection; on the contrary , from a firm conviction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor , so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything was as we have said , a question of arithmetic to cocles , and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude , that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment , as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles  belief; the last month s payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude; cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash , and the same evening he had brought them to m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> morrel had passed many an anxious hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in order to meet the payments then due; he had collected all his resources , and , fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity , he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wife s and daughter s jewels and a portion of his plate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by this means the end of the month was passed , but his resources were now exhausted . </s> </s>

<s> <s> de boville , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel had , in reality , no hope but the return of the pharaon , of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time , and which had already arrived in harbor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this vessel which , like the pharaon , came from calcutta , had been in for a fortnight , while no intelligence had been received of the pharaon . </s> </s>

<s> <s> morrel in person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> emmanuel sighed , and summoned cocles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cocles appeared , and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel s apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cocles went first , and the stranger followed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen , who looked with anxiety at the stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel is in his room , is he not , mademoiselle julie? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; i think so , at least , said the young girl hesitatingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go and see , cocles , and if my father is there , announce this gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it will be useless to announce me , mademoiselle , returned the englishman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel does not know my name; this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson & french of rome , with whom your father does business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the englishman entered , and found morrel seated at a table , turning over the formidable columns of his ledger , which contained the list of his liabilities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel closed the ledger , arose , and offered a seat to the stranger; and when he had seen him seated , resumed his own chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant , who , in his thirty - sixth year at the opening of this history , was now in his fiftieth; his hair had turned white , time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow , and his look , once so firm and penetrating , was now irresolute and wandering , as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur , said morrel , whose uneasiness was increased by this examination ,  - you wish to speak to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , monsieur; you are aware from whom i come? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the house of thomson & french; at least , so my cashier tells me . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the house of thomson & french had 300 ,000 or 400 ,000 francs to pay this month in france; and , knowing your strict punctuality , have collected all the bills bearing your signature , and charged me as they became due to present them , and to employ the money otherwise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , and for a considerable sum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the amount? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel with a voice he strove to render firm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville , the inspector of prisons , to whom they are due . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when are you to pay? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - half the 15th of this month , half the 15th of next . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just so; and now here are 32 ,500 francs payable shortly; they are all signed by you , and assigned to our house by the holders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is this all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is impossible to describe what morrel suffered during this enumeration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - two hundred and eighty - seven thousand five hundred francs , repeated he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , replied the englishman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will not , continued he , after a moment s silence ,  - conceal from you , that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged , yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said he ,  - up to this timeand it is now more than four - and - twenty years since i received the direction of this house from my father , who had himself conducted it for five - and - thirty yearsnever has anything bearing the signature of morrel & son been dishonored . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know that , replied the englishman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but as a man of honor should answer another , tell me fairly , shall you pay these with the same punctuality? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the other ,  - if this last resource fail you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , returned morrel ,  - it is a cruel thing to be forced to say , but , already used to misfortune , i must habituate myself to shame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you no friends who could assist you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel smiled mournfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in business , sir , said he ,  - one has no friends , only correspondents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is true , murmured the englishman;  - then you have but one hope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so that if this fail<s> <s>  - i am ruined ,completely ruined! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as i was on my way here , a vessel was coming into port . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know it , sir; a young man , who still adheres to my fallen fortunes , passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house , in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me; he has informed me of the arrival of this ship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and it is not yours? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , she is a bordeaux vessel , la gironde; she comes from india also; but she is not mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall i tell you plainly one thing , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> uncertainty is still hope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then in a low voice morrel added , - this delay is not natural . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily , and half - stifled sobs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two men remained opposite one another , morrel trembling in every limb , the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the noise had ceased; but it seemed that morrel expected somethingsomething had occasioned the noise , and something must follow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs; and that the footsteps , which were those of several persons , stopped at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a key was inserted in the lock of the first door , and the creaking of hinges was audible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there are only two persons who have the key to that door , murmured morrel ,  - cocles and julie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this instant the second door opened , and the young girl , her eyes bathed with tears , appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel rose tremblingly , supporting himself by the arm of the chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would have spoken , but his voice failed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel again changed color . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> julie threw herself into his arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured she ,  - courage! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the pharaon has gone down , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morrel in a hoarse voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl did not speak; but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father s breast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and the crew? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - saved , said the girl;  - saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come in , come in , said morrel ,  - for i presume you are all at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely had he uttered those words when madame morrel entered weeping bitterly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> emmanuel followed her , and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half - naked sailors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step; then restrained himself , and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers , julie still lay with her head on his shoulder , emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between morrel s family and the sailors at the door . </s> </s>

<s> <s> take in two reefs in the top - sails ,  cried the captain; let go the bowlin s , haul the brace , lower the top - gallant sails , haul out the reef - tackles on the yards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his firm , sonorous , and unexpected voice made everyone start . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> penelon put his hand over his eyes , and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manuvres of his captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we did better than that , sir , said the old sailor respectfully;  - we put the helm up to run before the tempest; ten minutes after we struck our top - sails and scudded under bare poles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the vessel was very old to risk that , said the englishman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - eh , it was that that did the business; after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> penelon ,  said the captain , i think we are sinking , give me the helm , and go down into the hold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i gave him the helm , and descended; there was already three feet of water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all hands to the pumps!   i shouted; but it was too late , and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah ,  said i , after four hours  work , since we are sinking , let us sink; we can die but once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump ,  said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well done! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the englishman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons , continued the sailor;  - and during that time the wind had abated , and the sea gone down , but the water kept rising; not much , only two inches an hour , but still it rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel will have nothing to reproach us with , we have tried to save the ship , let us now save ourselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , a sailor is attached to his ship , but still more to his life , so we did not wait to be told twice; the more so , that the ship was sinking under us , and seemed to say , get alongsave yourselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  we soon launched the boat , and all eight of us got into it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the captain descended last , or rather , he did not descend , he would not quit the vessel; so i took him round the waist , and threw him into the boat , and then i jumped after him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was time , for just as i jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a man - of - war . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ten minutes after she pitched forward , then the other way , spun round and round , and then good - bye to the pharaon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for us , we were three days without anything to eat or drink , so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest , when we saw la gironde; we made signals of distress , she perceived us , made for us , and took us all on board . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there now , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , that s the whole truth , on the honor of a sailor; is not it true , you fellows there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes; i hope so , at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made a sign to cocles , who went first; the seamen followed him and emmanuel brought up the rear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said the owner to his wife and daughter ,  - leave me; i wish to speak with this gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten , and retired; but , as she left the apartment , julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance , to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see , returned the englishman ,  - that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you , and this only increases my desire to serve you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , sir! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me see , continued the stranger ,  - i am one of your largest creditors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you wish for time to pay? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how long a delay do you wish for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel reflected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - two months , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will give you three , replied the stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , asked morrel ,  - will the house of thomson & french consent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i take everything on myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> today is the 5th of june . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , renew these bills up to the 5th of september; and on the 5th of september at eleven o clock ( the hand of the clock pointed to eleven ) , i shall come to receive the money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall expect you , returned morrel;  - and i will pay youor i shall be dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bills were renewed , the old ones destroyed , and the poor ship - owner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger met julie on the stairs; she pretended to be descending , but in reality she was waiting for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , sirsaid she , clasping her hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  do exactly what the letter bids you , however strange it may appear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i swear to you i will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continue to be the good , sweet girl you are at present , and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you emmanuel for a husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger waved his hand , and continued to descend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the court he found penelon , who , with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand , seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come with me , my friend , said the englishman;  - i wish to speak to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the extension provided for by the agent of thomson & french , at the moment when morrel expected it least , was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same day he told his wife , emmanuel , and his daughter all that had occurred; and a ray of hope , if not of tranquillity , returned to the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unfortunately , however , morrel had not only engagements with the house of thomson & french , who had shown themselves so considerate towards him; and , as he had said , in business he had correspondents , and not friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he thought the matter over , he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson & french towards him; and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this:  - we had better help a man who owes us nearly 300 ,000 francs , and have those 300 ,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin , and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bills signed by morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude , and , thanks to the delay granted by the englishman , were paid by cocles with equal punctuality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville , and on the 30th the 32 ,500 francs of bills , for which , as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons , he had time granted , he must be a ruined man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the opinion of all the commercial men was that , under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel , it was impossible for him to remain solvent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still confidence was not restored to all minds , and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the month passed , and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fortunately , morrel had some funds coming in on which he could rely; and , as they reached him , he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of july came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three persons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to the sailors of the pharaon , they must have found snug berths elsewhere , for they also had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> captain gaumard , recovered from his illness , had returned from palma . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he delayed presenting himself at morrel s , but the owner , hearing of his arrival , went to see him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the worthy shipowner knew , from penelon s recital , of the captain s brave conduct during the storm , and tried to console him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he brought him also the amount of his wages , which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he descended the staircase , morrel met penelon , who was going up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> penelon had , it would seem , made good use of his money , for he was newly clad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel attributed penelon s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire; it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account; he was , no doubt , engaged on board some other vessel , and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having , if we may so express ourselves , worn mourning for the pharaon longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck , and to offer him employment from his new master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - worthy fellows! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morrel , as he went away ,  - may your new master love you as i loved you , and be more fortunate than i have been! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the 20th of august it was known at marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach , and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month , and that morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk emmanuel , and his cashier cocles , to meet the creditors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , contrary to all expectation , when the 31st of august came , the house opened as usual , and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter , examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny , and , from first to last , paid all with the usual precision . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel had fully anticipated , and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was said at this moment that danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs , and had unlimited credit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , then , without taking a crown from his pocket , could save morrel; he had but to pass his word for a loan , and morrel was saved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel had long thought of danglars , but had kept away from some instinctive motive , and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and morrel was right , for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet , on his arrival , morrel did not utter a complaint , or say one harsh word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said the two women to emmanuel ,  - we are indeed ruined . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was agreed in a brief council held among them , that julie should write to her brother , who was in garrison at nmes , to come to them as speedily as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , maximilian morrel , though hardly two - and - twenty , had great influence over his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a strong - minded , upright young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had at once declared for a military life , and had in consequence studied hard , passed brilliantly through the polytechnic school , and left it as sub - lieutenant of the 53rd of the line . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a year he had held this rank , and expected promotion on the first vacancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance , not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier , but also of the duties of a man; and he thus gained the name of  - the stoic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it , and did not even know what it meant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had not mistaken the gravity of this event , for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles , julie saw the latter leave it pale , trembling , and his features betraying the utmost consternation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she would have questioned him as he passed by her , but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation , and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , mademoiselle , mademoiselle , what a dreadful misfortune! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who could ever have believed it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers , a portfolio , and a bag of money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel examined the ledgers , opened the portfolio , and counted the money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not even the means for making a possible settlement on account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , when morrel went down to his dinner , he appeared very calm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the phocens , and read the semaphore; this day he did not leave the house , but returned to his office . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to cocles , he seemed completely bewildered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for part of the day he went into the courtyard , seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> emmanuel tried to comfort the women , but his eloquence faltered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> night came , the two women had watched , hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them , but they heard him pass before their door , and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they listened; he went into his sleeping - room , and fastened the door inside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame morrel sent her daughter to bed , and half an hour after julie had retired , she rose , took off her shoes , and went stealthily along the passage , to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the passage she saw a retreating shadow; it was julie , who , uneasy herself , had anticipated her mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young lady went towards madame morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is writing , she said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had understood each other without speaking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame morrel looked again through the keyhole , morrel was writing; but madame morrel remarked , what her daughter had not observed , that her husband was writing on stamped paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her; she shuddered , and yet had not strength to utter a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> julie trembled at this request , which seemed to her of bad omen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why did her father ask for this key which she always kept , and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl looked at morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what have i done wrong , father , she said ,  - that you should take this key from me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must have left it in my room , she said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she went out , but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult emmanuel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not give this key to your father , said he ,  - and tomorrow morning , if possible , do not quit him for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she questioned emmanuel , but he knew nothing , or would not say what he knew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was three o clock when he threw himself on the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mother and daughter passed the night together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had expected maximilian since the previous evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was calm; but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> julie , mindful of emmanuel s request , was following her father when he quitted the room , but he said to her quickly: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - remain with your mother , dearest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken , but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness , and julie did not dare to disobey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - maximilian , my dearest brother! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at these words madame morrel rose , and threw herself into her son s arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mother , said the young man , looking alternately at madame morrel and her daughter ,  - what has occurredwhat has happened? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - julie , said madame morrel , making a sign to the young man ,  - go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young lady rushed out of the apartment , but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not know you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - read this letter , he said , handing it to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl hastily took the letter from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she opened it quickly and read: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go this moment to the alles de meilhan , enter the house no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 15 , ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor , enter the apartment , take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk , and give it to your father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is important that he should receive it before eleven o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you promised to obey me implicitly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> remember your oath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sinbad the sailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl uttered a joyful cry , raised her eyes , looked round to question the messenger , but he had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time , and saw there was a postscript . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she read: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you go accompanied by any other person , or should anyone else go in your place , the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this postscript decreased greatly the young girl s happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was there nothing to fear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was there not some snare laid for her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but there is no need to know danger in order to fear it; indeed , it may be observed , that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet , through a singular impulse , it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied , but to emmanuel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of thomson & french had come to her father s , related the scene on the staircase , repeated the promise she had made , and showed him the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must go , then , mademoiselle , said emmanuel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; i will accompany you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will await you at the corner of the rue du muse , and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy , i will hasten to rejoin you , and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , emmanuel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the young girl with hesitation ,  - it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what danger threatens him , then , emmanuel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , he said;  - today is the 5th of september , is it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - today , then , at eleven o clock , your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , we know that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what will happen then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried she , hastening away with the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during this time , madame morrel had told her son everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man knew quite well that , after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father , great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping; but he did not know that matters had reached such a point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was thunderstruck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open , turned , and saw his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of going direct to his study , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel had returned to his bedchamber , which he was only this moment quitting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son , of whose arrival he was ignorant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained motionless on the spot , pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father , he exclaimed , turning pale as death ,  - what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , this is what i feared! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father , father , in heaven s name , exclaimed the young man ,  - what are these weapons for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , and i will explain to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel opened the door , and closed it behind his son; then , crossing the anteroom , went to his desk on which he placed the pistols , and pointed with his finger to an open ledger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this ledger was made out an exact balance - sheet of his affairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel had to pay , within half an hour , 287 ,500 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all he possessed was 15 ,257 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - read! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man was overwhelmed as he read . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel said not a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what could he say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and have you done all that is possible , father , to meet this disastrous result? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the young man , after a moment s pause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have no money coming in on which you can rely? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have exhausted every resource? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and in half an hour , said maximilian in a gloomy voice ,  - our name is dishonored! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - blood washes out dishonor , said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are right , father; i understand you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then extending his hand towards one of the pistols , he said ,  - there is one for you and one for methanks! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel caught his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your motheryour sister! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a shudder ran through the young man s frame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father , he said ,  - do you reflect that you are bidding me to live? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i do so bid you , answered morrel ,  - it is your duty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have a calm , strong mind , maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian , you are no ordinary man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man reflected for a moment , then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes , and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets , the insignia of his rank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be it so , then , my father , he said , extending his hand to morrel ,  - die in peace , my father; i will live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son , but maximilian caught him in his arms , and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian smiled . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and now there is no more to be said; go and rejoin your mother and sister . </s> </s>

<s> <s> go to work , labor , young man , struggle ardently and courageously; live , yourself , your mother and sister , with the most rigid economy , so that from day to day the property of those whom i leave in your hands may augment and fructify . </s> </s>

 <s> <s>  - my father , my father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the young man ,  - why should you not live? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i live , all would be changed; if i live , interest would be converted into doubt , pity into hostility; if i live i am only a man who has broken his word , failed in his engagementsin fact , only a bankrupt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if , on the contrary , i die , remember , maximilian , my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> living , you would feel shame at my name; dead , you may raise your head and say , i am the son of him you killed , because , for the first time , he has been compelled to break his word . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the young man uttered a groan , but appeared resigned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now , said morrel ,  - leave me alone , and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you not see my sister once more? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - go , leave me; i would be alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hear me , maximilian , said his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - suppose i were a soldier like you , and ordered to carry a certain redoubt , and you knew i must be killed in the assault , would you not say to me , as you said just now , go , father; for you are dishonored by delay , and death is preferable to shame!  <s> <s>  - yes , yes , said the young man ,  - yes; and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure , he said ,  - be it so , my father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when his son had left him , morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door; then putting forth his arm , he pulled the bell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a moment s interval , cocles appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was no longer the same manthe fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - my worthy cocles , said morrel in a tone impossible to describe ,  - do you remain in the antechamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the gentleman who came three months agothe agent of thomson & frencharrives , announce his arrival to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel fell back in his chair , his eyes fixed on the clock; there were seven minutes left , that was all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony cannot be told in words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was still comparatively young , he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family , but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning , illogical perhaps , yet certainly plausible , that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world , even life itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to form the slightest idea of his feelings , one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear - moistened eyes raised to heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the minute hand moved on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pistols were loaded; he stretched forth his hand , took one up , and murmured his daughter s name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he laid it down , seized his pen , and wrote a few words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took up the deadly weapon again , his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock , and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow , a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart - strings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hingesthe clock gave its warning to strike eleventhe door of his study opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly he heard a cryit was his daughter s voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned and saw julie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pistol fell from his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , savedsaved! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see , see! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the young girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel passed his hand over his brow; it seemed to him a dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment the clock struck eleven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - explain , my child , he said ,  - explain , my child , he said ,  - explainwhere did you find this purse? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 15 , on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , cried morrel ,  - this purse is not yours! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and did you go alone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur morrel! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed a voice on the stairs;  - monsieur morrel! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is his voice! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said julie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the pharaon! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried;  - the pharaon! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! what! the pharaon! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you mad , emmanuel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the pharaon , sirthey signal the pharaon! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pharaon is entering the harbor! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel fell back in his chair , his strength was failing him; his understanding weakened by such events , refused to comprehend such incredible , unheard - of , fabulous facts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father , cried maximilian ,  - how could you say the pharaon was lost? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lookout has signalled her , and they say she is now coming into port . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear friends , said morrel ,  - if this be so , it must be a miracle of heaven! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> impossible , impossible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand , the acceptance receiptedthe splendid diamond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , sir , exclaimed cocles ,  - what can it mean? the pharaon? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , dear ones , said morrel , rising from his seat ,  - let us go and see , and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a moment they were at the canebire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the pharaon! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pharaon! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , wonderful to see , in front of the tower of saint - jean , was a ship bearing on her stern these words , printed in white letters ,  - the pharaon , morrel & son , of marseilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she cast anchor , clued up sails , and on the deck was captain gaumard giving orders , and good old penelon making signals to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to doubt any longer was impossible; there was the evidence of the senses , and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be happy , noble heart , be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter , and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then a launch came to shore , took him on board , and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up , on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor; thence he once again looked towards morrel , who , weeping with joy , was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him , and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now , said the unknown ,  - farewell kindness , humanity , and gratitude! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at these words he gave a signal , and , as if only awaiting this signal , the yacht instantly put out to sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> towards the beginning of the year 1838 , two young men belonging to the first society of paris , the viscount albert de morcerf and the baron franz d pinay , were at florence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had agreed to see the carnival at rome that year , and that franz , who for the last three or four years had inhabited italy , should act as cicerone to albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> signor pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor , which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they accepted his offer; but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left , albert started for naples . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for franz , he remained at florence , and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the cascine , and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the florentine nobility , he took a fancy into his head ( having already visited corsica , the cradle of bonaparte ) to visit elba , the waiting - place of napoleon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn , wrapped himself in his coat and lay down , and said to the crew , - to the island of elba! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning franz disembarked at porto - ferrajo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he traversed the island , after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left , and re - embarked for marciana . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two hours after he again landed at pianosa , where he was assured that red partridges abounded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sport was bad; franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges , and , like every unsuccessful sportsman , he returned to the boat very much out of temper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , if your excellency chose , said the captain ,  - you might have capital sport . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you see that island? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continued the captain , pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency does not require a permit , for the island is uninhabited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks , and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to whom does this island belong? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to tuscany . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what game shall i find there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thousands of wild goats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who live upon the stones , i suppose , said franz with an incredulous smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on shore in the grottos , or on board in your cloak; besides , if your excellency pleases , we can leave as soon as you likewe can sail as well by night as by day , and if the wind drops we can use our oars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as franz had sufficient time , and his apartments at rome were not yet available , he accepted the proposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon his answer in the affirmative , the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is there any difficulty in the way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied the captain ,  - but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the deuce! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that puts a different face on the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> six days! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but who will say your excellency has been to monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i shall not , cried franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nor i , nor i , chorused the sailors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then steer for monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the captain gave his orders , the helm was put up , and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz waited until all was in order , and when the sail was filled , and the four sailors had taken their placesthree forward , and one at the helmhe resumed the conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gaetano , said he to the captain ,  - you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for pirates , who are , it seems to me , a very different kind of game from the goats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , your excellency , and it is true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i knew there were smugglers , but i thought that since the capture of algiers , and the destruction of the regency , pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency is mistaken; there are pirates , like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , and who yet , every day , rob travellers at the gates of rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has not your excellency heard that the french charg d affaires was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , i heard that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , if , like us , your excellency lived at leghorn , you would hear , from time to time , that a little merchant vessel , or an english yacht that was expected at bastia , at porto - ferrajo , or at civita vecchia , has not arrived; no one knows what has become of it , but , doubtless , it has struck on a rock and foundered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , asked franz , who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat ,  - why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french , sardinian , or tuscan governments? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , why? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because , in the first place , they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking , then they bind the crew hand and foot , they attach to everyone s neck a four - and - twenty - pound ball , a large hole is chopped in the vessel s bottom , and then they leave her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first one gun l goes under , then the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they lift and sink again , and both go under at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all at once there s a noise like a cannonthat s the air blowing up the deck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you understand now , said the captain ,  - why no complaints are made to the government , and why the vessel never reaches port? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition , franz would have hesitated , but now that they had started , he thought it would be cowardly to draw back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project , replied gaetano ,  - but you questioned me , and i have answered; that s all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , and your conversation is most interesting; and as i wish to enjoy it as long as possible , steer for monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea , and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another , like cannon balls in an arsenal , with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the sailors , although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert , and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing , and on which a few fishing - boats , with their white sails , were alone visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica , whose mountains appeared against the sky , showing their rugged peaks in bold relief; this mass of rock , like the giant adamastor , rose dead ahead , a formidable barrier , and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an hour had passed since the sun had set , when franz fancied he saw , at a quarter of a mile to the left , a dark mass , but he could not precisely make out what it was , and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land , he remained silent; suddenly a great light appeared on the strand; land might resemble a cloud , but the fire was not a meteor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the captain;  - it is a fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you told me the island was uninhabited? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and for pirates? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and for pirates , returned gaetano , repeating franz s words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island , for , as you see , the fire is behind us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continued franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , that goes for nothing , said gaetano . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness , you will see that the fire cannot be seen from the side or from pianosa , but only from the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you think , then , this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you shall see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gaetano consulted with his companions , and after five minutes  discussion a manuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about , they returned the way they had come , and in a few minutes the fire disappeared , hidden by an elevation of the land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gaetano lowered the sail , and the boat came to rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this was done in silence , and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for franz , he examined his arms with the utmost coolness; he had two double - barrelled guns and a rifle; he loaded them , looked at the priming , and waited quietly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this track soon disappeared; it was evident that he had touched the shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour , when the same luminous track was again observed , and the swimmer was soon on board . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they are spanish smugglers , said he;  - they have with them two corsican bandits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity ,  - we ought always to help one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this costs us nothing , and saves the life , or at least the liberty , of a fellow - creature , who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency , we must live somehow , returned the other , smiling impenetrably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you know the men who are now on monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , we sailors are like freemasons , and recognize each other by signs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing at all; smugglers are not thieves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said franz , calculating the chances of peril . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not their fault that they are bandits , but that of the authorities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because they are pursued for having made a stiff , as if it was not in a corsican s nature to revenge himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean by having made a stiff? having assassinated a man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i mean that they have killed an enemy , which is a very different thing , returned the captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the young man ,  - let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you think they will grant it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how many are they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - four , and the two bandits make six . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by all means , be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses; i do more than permit , i exhort you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - silence , then! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said gaetano . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone obeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know , and who had no reason to be devoted to him; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt , and who had often examined his weapons ,which were very beautiful ,if not with envy , at least with curiosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the other hand , he was about to land , without any other escort than these men , on an island which had , indeed , a very religious name , but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality , thanks to the smugglers and bandits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the history of the scuttled vessels , which had appeared improbable during the day , seemed very probable at night; placed as he was between two possible sources of danger , he kept his eye on the crew , and his gun in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sailors had again hoisted sail , and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> through the darkness franz , whose eyes were now more accustomed to it , could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing , and then , as they rounded a rocky point , he saw the fire more brilliant than ever , and about it five or six persons seated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gaetano skirted the light , carefully keeping the boat in the shadow; then , when they were opposite the fire , he steered to the centre of the circle , singing a fishing song , of which his companions sung the chorus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they soon appeared satisfied and returned ( with the exception of one , who remained at the shore ) to their fire , at which the carcass of a goat was roasting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore , the man on the beach , who carried a carbine , presented arms after the manner of a sentinel , and cried ,  - who comes there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz coolly cocked both barrels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand , but which evidently concerned him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my name must rest unknown , replied franz;  - merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer , the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire , who rose and disappeared among the rocks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not a word was spoken , everyone seemed occupied , franz with his disembarkment , the sailors with their sails , the smugglers with their goat; but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel , who , turning to the boat , said ,  - s accommodi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is like that turkish phrase of molire s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sailors did not wait for a second invitation; four strokes of the oar brought them to land; gaetano sprang to shore , exchanged a few words with the sentinel , then his comrades disembarked , and lastly came franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not that way , if you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gaetano faltered an excuse , and advanced to the opposite side , while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they advanced about thirty paces , and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks , in which seats had been cut , not unlike sentry - boxes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz lowered a torch , and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat , which was , doubtless , one of the halting - places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he mentioned this to gaetano , who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat , bread , wine , half a dozen partridges , and a good fire to roast them by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - besides , added he ,  - if the smell of their roast meat tempts you , i will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are a born diplomat , returned franz;  - go and try . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz waited impatiently , inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat , when the captain returned with a mysterious air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said franz ,  - anything new? do they refuse? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on the contrary , returned gaetano ,  - the chief , who was told you were a young frenchman , invites you to sup with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , observed franz ,  - this chief is very polite , and i see no objectionthe more so as i bring my share of the supper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , it is not that; he has plenty , and to spare , for supper; but he makes one condition , and rather a peculiar one , before he will receive you at his house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has he built one here , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , but he has a very comfortable one all the same , so they say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - favorably or otherwise? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the deuce! and what is this condition? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz looked at gaetano , to see , if possible , what he thought of this proposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , replied he , guessing franz s thought ,  - i know this is a serious matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i , who have nothing to lose ,i should go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you would accept? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is something very peculiar about this chief , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do they say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what nonsense! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said franz , reseating himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is no nonsense; it is quite true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cama , the pilot of the saint ferdinand , went in once , and he came back amazed , vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know , observed franz ,  - that with such stories you make me think of ali baba s enchanted cavern? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i tell you what i have been told . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you advise me to accept? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i don t say that; your excellency will do as you please; i should be sorry to advise you in the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz pondered the matter for a few moments , concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had , and seeing only the prospect of a good supper , accepted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gaetano departed with the reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz was prudent , and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned towards the sailor , who , during this dialogue , had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office , and asked him how these men had landed , as no vessel of any kind was visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never mind that , returned the sailor ,  - i know their vessel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would not wish for a better to sail round the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of what burden is she? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is what the english call a yacht . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where was she built? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know not; but my own opinion is she is a genoese . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; but gaetano did , i thought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance , he had not then spoken to anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and if this person be not a smuggler , who is he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a wealthy signor , who travels for his pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and where does he reside? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what country does he come from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you ever seen him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sometimes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what sort of a man is he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency will judge for yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where will he receive me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you never had the curiosity , when you have landed and found this island deserted , to seek for this enchanted palace? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - decidedly , muttered franz ,  - this is an arabian nights  adventure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his excellency waits for you , said a voice , which he recognized as that of the sentinel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket , and presented it to the man who had spoken to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without uttering a word , they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then his two guides took his arms , and he went on , guided by them , and preceded by the sentinel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after going about thirty paces , he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting , and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac; they then led him on about fifty paces farther , evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow gaetano to goa refusal he could now comprehend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently , by a change in the atmosphere , he knew that they were entering a cave; after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling , and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed , and became balmy and perfumed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet , and his guides let go their hold of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a moment s silence , and then a voice , in excellent french , although , with a foreign accent , said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - welcome , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it may be supposed , then , franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission , but took off the handkerchief , and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty - eight to forty years of age , dressed in a tunisian costume , that is to say , a red cap with a long blue silk tassel , a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold , pantaloons of deep red , large and full gaiters of the same color , embroidered with gold like the vest , and yellow slippers; he had a splendid cashmere round his waist , and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although of a paleness that was almost livid , this man had a remarkably handsome face; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling; his nose , quite straight , and projecting direct from the brow , was of the pure greek type , while his teeth , as white as pearls , were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his pallor was so peculiar , that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed , and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was not particularly tall , but extremely well made , and , like the men of the south , had small hands and feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what astonished franz , who had treated gaetano s description as a fable , was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade , worked with flowers of gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a recess was a kind of divan , surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards , and the handles resplendent with gems; from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass , of beautiful shape and color , while the feet rested on a turkey carpet , in which they sunk to the instep; tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered , and also in front of another door , leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise , and , moreover , returned look for look , not even taking his eyes off him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness , and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find herethat is to say , a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi , my dear sir , replied franz ,  - make no apologies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have always observed that they bandage people s eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces , for instance , those of raoul in the huguenots , and really i have nothing to complain of , for what i see makes me think of the wonders of the arabian nights . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i may say with lucullus , if i could have anticipated the honor of your visit , i would have prepared for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but such as is my hermitage , it is at your disposal; such as is my supper , it is yours to share , if you will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali , is the supper ready? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment the tapestry moved aside , and a nubian , black as ebony , and dressed in a plain white tunic , made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said the unknown to franz ,  - i do not know if you are of my opinion , but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i only request you to give me one by which i may have the pleasure of addressing you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - and i , replied franz ,  - will tell you , as i only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like aladdin , that i see no reason why at this moment i should not be called aladdin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , signor aladdin , replied the singular amphitryon ,  - you heard our repast announced , will you now take the trouble to enter the dining - room , your humble servant going first to show the way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at these words , moving aside the tapestry , sinbad preceded his guest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dining - room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left; it was entirely of marble , with antique bas - reliefs of priceless value; and at the four corners of this apartment , which was oblong , were four magnificent statues , having baskets in their hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds; a boar s ham with jelly , a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce , a glorious turbot , and a gigantic lobster . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dishes were of silver , and the plates of japanese china . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali alone was present to wait at table , and acquitted himself so admirably , that the guest complimented his host thereupon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - would it be impertinent , signor sinbad , said franz ,  - to ask you the particulars of this kindness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color , and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out , and his hand and head cut off; the tongue the first day , the hand the second , and the head the third . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i always had a desire to have a mute in my service , so learning the day his tongue was cut out , i went to the bey , and proposed to give him for ali a splendid double - barreled gun , which i knew he was very desirous of having . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when i added to the gun an english cutlass with which i had shivered his highness s yataghan to pieces , the bey yielded , and agreed to forgive the hand and head , but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in tunis . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed , he said , by way of changing the conversation ,  - you pass your life in travelling? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it , said the unknown with a singular smile;  - and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have suffered a great deal , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said franz inquiringly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sinbad started and looked fixedly at him , as he replied ,  - what makes you suppose so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i? i live the happiest life possible , the real life of a pasha . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am king of all creation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am pleased with one place , and stay there; i get tired of it , and leave it; i am free as a bird and have wings like one; my attendants obey my slightest wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then i have my mode of dispensing justice , silent and sure , without respite or appeal , which condemns or pardons , and which no one sees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , if you had tasted my life , you would not desire any other , and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - revenge , for instance! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> observed franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and why revenge? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because , replied franz ,  - you seem to me like a man who , persecuted by society , has a fearful account to settle with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> responded sinbad , laughing with his singular laugh , which displayed his white and sharp teeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have not guessed rightly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; it will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must seem to you by no means curious , but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so longit will happen one day or the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and do you propose to make this journey very shortly? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure , replied the host ,  - but , unfortunately , if i go there , it will be , in all probability , incognito . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz , for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franz s curiosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he replaced the lid , as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it , and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you cannot guess , said he ,  - what there is in that small vase , can you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i really cannot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , replied franz ,  - this ambrosia , no doubt , in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name; in vulgar phrase , what may you term this composition , for which , to tell the truth , i do not feel any particular desire? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you a man for the substantials , and is gold your god? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you a man of imaginationa poet? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> taste this , and in an hour you will be a king , not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of europe like france , spain , or england , but king of the world , king of the universe , king of creation; without bowing at the feet of satan , you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it not tempting what i offer you , and is it not an easy thing , since it is only to do thus? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded , took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat , raised it to his lips , and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat , but when he had finished , he inquired: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , then , is this precious stuff? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course i have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> into these pavilions he admitted the elect , and there , says marco polo , gave them to eat a certain herb , which transported them to paradise , in the midst of ever - blooming shrubs , ever - ripe fruit , and ever - lovely virgins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know thatby name at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know , said franz ,  - i have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - judge for yourself , signor aladdinjudge , but do not confine yourself to one trial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a struggle in nature against this divine substance ,in nature which is not made for joy and clings to pain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nature subdued must yield in the combat , the dream must succeed to reality , and then the dream reigns supreme , then the dream becomes life , and life becomes the dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence , that you would desire to live no longer , but to dream thus forever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> taste the hashish , guest of minetaste the hashish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation , about as much in quantity as his host had eaten , and lift it to his mouth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said , after having swallowed the divine preserve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe , but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , the first time you tasted oysters , tea , porter , truffles , and sundry other dainties which you now adore , did you like them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assaftida , and the chinese eat swallows  nests? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , it is the same with hashish; only eat for a week , and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor , which now appears to you flat and distasteful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us now go into the adjoining chamber , which is your apartment , and ali will bring us coffee and pipes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they both arose , and while he who called himself sinbadand whom we have occasionally named so , that we might , like his guest , have some title by which to distinguish himgave some orders to the servant , franz entered still another apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was simply yet richly furnished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was round , and a large divan completely encircled it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> divan , walls , ceiling , floor , were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets; there were heavy - maned lion - skins from atlas , striped tiger - skins from bengal; panther - skins from the cape , spotted beautifully , like those that appeared to dante; bear - skins from siberia , fox - skins from norway , and so on; and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other , so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf , or reclining on the most luxurious bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> both laid themselves down on the divan; chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach , and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each of them took one , which ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a moment s silence , during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly , even in the midst of his conversation; and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie , into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco , which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind , and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali brought in the coffee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how do you take it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the unknown;  - in the french or turkish style , strong or weak , sugar or none , cool or boiling? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as you please; it is ready in all ways . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will take it in the turkish style , replied franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , those orientals; they are the only men who know how to live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi , said franz ,  - it would be the easiest thing in the world; for i feel eagle s wings springing out at my shoulders , and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in four - and - twenty hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , unfurl your wings , and fly into superhuman regions; fear nothing , there is a watch over you; and if your wings , like those of icarus , melt before the sun , we are here to ease your fall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness , his perception brightened in a remarkable manner , his senses seemed to redouble their power , the horizon continued to expand; but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms , and which he had seen before he slept , but a blue , transparent , unbounded horizon , with all the blue of the ocean , all the spangles of the sun , all the perfumes of the summer breeze; then , in the midst of the songs of his sailors ,songs so clear and sonorous , that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down ,he saw the island of monte cristo , no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves , but as an oasis in the desert; then , as his boat drew nearer , the songs became louder , for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven , as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither , or amphion , the enchanter , intended there to build a city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length the boat touched the shore , but without effort , without shock , as lips touch lips; and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were phryne , cleopatra , messalina , those three celebrated courtesans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes , and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled; and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lips of stone turned to flame , breasts of ice became like heated lava , so that to franz , yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug , love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture , as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips , and he was held in cool serpent - like embraces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall , and at length , weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul , he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses , and the enchantment of his marvellous dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when franz returned to himself , he seemed still to be in a dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thought himself in a sepulchre , into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stretched forth his hand , and touched stone; he rose to his seat , and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather , very soft and odoriferous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the vision had fled; and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb , they had vanished at his waking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came , and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found that he was in a grotto , went towards the opening , and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature , specially after a fantastic dream; then gradually this view of the outer world , so calm , so pure , so grand , reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision , and once more awakened memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he recalled his arrival on the island , his presentation to a smuggler chief , a subterranean palace full of splendor , an excellent supper , and a spoonful of hashish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed , however , even in the very face of open day , that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed , so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream , and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors , seated on a rock , or undulating in the vessel , one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> otherwise , his head was perfectly clear , and his body refreshed; he was free from the slightest headache; on the contrary , he felt a certain degree of lightness , a faculty for absorbing the pure air , and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went gayly up to the sailors , who rose as soon as they perceived him; and the patron , accosting him , said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , then , gaetano , said franz ,  - this is , then , all reality; there exists a man who has received me in this island , entertained me right royally , and has departed while i was asleep? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread; and if you will use your glass , you will , in all probability , recognize your host in the midst of his crew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gaetano was not mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore , and holding a spy - glass in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was attired as he had been on the previous evening , and waved his pocket - handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a second , a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel , which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air , and then franz heard a slight report . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , do you hear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> observed gaetano;  - he is bidding you adieu . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air , but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what are your excellency s orders? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired gaetano . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the first place , light me a torch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes , i understand , replied the patron ,  - to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with much pleasure , your excellency , if it would amuse you; and i will get you the torch you ask for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giovanni , light a torch , he added ,  - and give it to his excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giovanni obeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz took the lamp , and entered the subterranean grotto , followed by gaetano . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw nothing , unless that , by traces of smoke , others had before him attempted the same thing , and , like him , in vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall , as impenetrable as futurity , without strict scrutiny; he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it , or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of this time he gave up his search , and gaetano smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when franz appeared again on the shore , the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats , which he had utterly forgotten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took his fowling - piece , and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty , rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these animals , though wild and agile as chamois , were too much like domestic goats , and franz could not consider them as game . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , other ideas , much more enthralling , occupied his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since , the evening before , he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the thousand and one nights , and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , in spite of the failure of his first search , he began a second , after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the second visit was a long one , and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper; and he saw the little yacht , now like a sea - gull on the wave , continuing her flight towards corsica . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , he remarked to gaetano ,  - you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga , while it seems he is in the direction of porto - vecchio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true; and he is going to land them , added franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - precisely so , replied gaetano . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , he is one who fears neither god nor satan , they say , and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy , said franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what cares he for that , replied gaetano with a laugh ,  - or any authorities? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he smiles at them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let them try to pursue him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , in the first place , his yacht is not a ship , but a bird , and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine; and if he were to throw himself on the coast , why , is he not certain of finding friends everywhere? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad , franz s host , had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the mediterranean , and so enjoyed exceptional privileges . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to franz , he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night; and then supper , sinbad , hashish , statues ,all became a dream for franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boat sailed on all day and all night , and next morning , when the sun rose , they had lost sight of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when franz had once again set foot on shore , he forgot , for the moment at least , the events which had just passed , while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence , and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion , who was awaiting him at rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an apartment , as we have said , had been retained beforehand , and thus he had but to go to signor pastrini s hotel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he sent his card to signor pastrini , and asked for albert de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two rooms looked on to the streeta fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese; but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very good , signor pastrini , said franz;  - but we must have some supper instantly , and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as to supper , replied the landlord ,  - you shall be served immediately; but as for the carriage<s> <s>  - what as to the carriage? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , replied the host ,  - we will do all in our power to procure you onethis is all i can say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tomorrow morning , answered the innkeeper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , the deuce! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then we shall pay the more , that s all , i see plainly enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then they must put horses to mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a little worse for the journey , but that s no matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there are no horses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said ,  - but can t we have post - horses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is supper ready , signor pastrini? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , your excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morcerf then , with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well - lined pocketbook , supped , went to bed , slept soundly , and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in a coach with six horses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning franz woke first , and instantly rang the bell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sound had not yet died away when signor pastrini himself entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is to say , excellency , replied pastrini , who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eyes of his guest ,  - that there are no carriages to be had from sunday to tuesday evening , but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , that is something , said albert;  - today is thursday , and who knows what may arrive between this and sunday? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive , replied franz ,  - which will make it still more difficult . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at least we can have a window? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , a window! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed signor pastrini , - utterly impossible; there was only one left on the fifth floor of the doria palace , and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said franz to albert ,  - do you know what is the best thing we can do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , the devil , no , cried albert;  - i came to rome to see the carnival , and i will , though i see it on stilts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bravo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an excellent idea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the landes , and we shall have complete success . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - parbleu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and , as i am not a millionaire , like the gentleman in the next apartments , said franz ,  - i warn you , that as i have been four times before at rome , i know the prices of all the carriages; we will give you twelve piastres for today , tomorrow , and the day after , and then you will make a good profit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , excellencysaid pastrini , still striving to gain his point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now go , returned franz ,  - or i shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore , who is mine also; he is an old friend of mine , who has plundered me pretty well already , and , in the hope of making more out of me , he will take a less price than the one i offer you; you will lose the preference , and that will be your fault . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not give yourselves the trouble , excellency , returned signor pastrini , with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat;  - i will do all i can , and i hope you will be satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when do you wish the carriage to be here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in an hour it will be at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion , but , in spite of its humble exterior , the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excellency , cried the cicerone , seeing franz approach the window ,  - shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz was the  - excellency , the vehicle was the  - carriage , and the htel de londres was the  - palace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and albert descended , the carriage approached the palace; their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats; the cicerone sprang into the seat behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to saint peter s first , and then to the colosseum , returned albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peter s , and a month to study it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day was passed at saint peter s alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly the daylight began to fade away; franz took out his watchit was half - past four . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they returned to the hotel; at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight , as he had shown him saint peter s by daylight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we show a friend a city one has already visited , we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo , skirt the outer wall , and re - enter by the porta san giovanni; thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol , the forum , the arch of septimus severus , the temple of antoninus and faustina , and the via sacra . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they sat down to dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> signor pastrini had promised them a banquet; he gave them a tolerable repast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised , and began accordingly , but at the first words he was interrupted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excellency , said pastrini ,  - i am delighted to have your approbation , but it was not for that i came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer; at rome things can or cannot be done; when you are told anything cannot be done , there is an end of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is much more convenient at paris ,when anything cannot be done , you pay double , and it is done directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is what all the french say , returned signor pastrini , somewhat piqued;  - for that reason , i do not understand why they travel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said albert , emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs ,  - only madmen , or blockheads like us , ever do travel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder , their walk on the boulevard de gand , and the caf de paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said franz , in his turn interrupting his host s meditations ,  - you had some motive for coming here , may i beg to know what it was? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes; you have ordered your carriage at eight o clock precisely? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is the same thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo , to drive round the walls , and re - enter by the porta san giovanni? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , this route is impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - impossible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very dangerous , to say the least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dangerous! and why? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on account of the famous luigi vampa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pray , who may this famous luigi vampa be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you not know him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have not that honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have never heard his name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , he is a bandit , compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were mere children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now then , albert , cried franz ,  - here is a bandit for you at last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i forewarn you , signor pastrini , that i shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us; having told you this , begin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once upon a time  well , go on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> signor pastrini turned toward franz , who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two; we must do him justice ,he had had a great many frenchmen in his house , but had never been able to comprehend them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excellency , said he gravely , addressing franz ,  - if you look upon me as a liar , it is useless for me to say anything; it was for your interest i<s> <s>  - albert does not say you are a liar , signor pastrini , said franz ,  - but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us ,but i will believe all you say; so proceed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , sit down , and tell us all about this signor vampa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of mastrilla . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , what has this bandit to do with the order i have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo , and to re - enter by the porta san giovanni? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this , replied signor pastrini ,  - that you will go out by one , but i very much doubt your returning by the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because , after nightfall , you are not safe fifty yards from the gates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , returned signor pastrini , hurt at albert s repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions ,  - i do not say this to you , but to your companion , who knows rome , and knows , too , that these things are not to be laughed at . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear fellow , said albert , turning to franz ,  - here is an admirable adventure; we will fill our carriage with pistols , blunderbusses , and double - barrelled guns . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whilst albert proposed this scheme , signor pastrini s face assumed an expression impossible to describe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not out of my armory , for at terracina i was plundered even of my hunting - knife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shared the same fate at aquapendente . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising , for he only answered half the question , and then he spoke to franz , as the only one likely to listen with attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried albert , whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely ,  - not make any resistance! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit , ruin , or aqueduct , and level their pieces at you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the innkeeper turned to franz with an air that seemed to say ,  - your friend is decidedly mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma christi , which he sipped at intervals , muttering some unintelligible words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , signor pastrini , said franz ,  - now that my companion is quieted , and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are , tell me who is this luigi vampa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is he a shepherd or a nobleman? young or old? tall or short? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points , for i knew him when he was a child , and one day that i fell into his hands , going from ferentino to alatri , he , fortunately for me , recollected me , and set me free , not only without ransom , but made me a present of a very splendid watch , and related his history to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us see the watch , said albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> signor pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent brguet , bearing the name of its maker , of parisian manufacture , and a count s coronet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here it is , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - peste! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us hear the history , said franz , motioning signor pastrini to seat himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellencies permit it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the host . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the host sat down , after having made each of them a respectful bow , which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi vampa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you tell me , said franz , at the moment signor pastrini was about to open his mouth ,  - that you knew luigi vampa when he was a childhe is still a young man , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a young man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is only two - and - twenty;he will gain himself a reputation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , and at his age , alexander , csar , and napoleon , who have all made some noise in the world , were quite behind him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , continued franz ,  - the hero of this history is only two - and - twenty? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - scarcely so much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is he tall or short? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thanks for the comparison , said albert , with a bow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on , signor pastrini , continued franz , smiling at his friend s susceptibility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to what class of society does he belong? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he was a shepherd - boy attached to the farm of the count of san - felice , situated between palestrina and the lake of gabri; he was born at pampinara , and entered the count s service when he was five years old; his father was also a shepherd , who owned a small flock , and lived by the wool and the milk , which he sold at rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when quite a child , the little vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the child accepted joyfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of three months he had learned to read . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the priest had a writing teacher at rome make three alphabetsone large , one middling , and one small; and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a slate , and thus learn to write . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same evening , when the flock was safe at the farm , the little luigi hastened to the smith at palestrina , took a large nail , heated and sharpened it , and formed a sort of stylus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of three months he had learned to write . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this demanded new effort , but nothing compared to the first; at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curate related the incident to the count of san - felice , who sent for the little shepherd , made him read and write before him , ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics , and to give him two piastres a month . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this , luigi purchased books and pencils . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two children met , sat down near each other , let their flocks mingle together , played , laughed , and conversed together; in the evening they separated the count of san - felice s flock from those of baron cervetri , and the children returned to their respective farms , promising to meet the next morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vampa was twelve , and teresa eleven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet their natural disposition revealed itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> none of the lads of pampinara , palestrina , or valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his disposition ( always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them ) kept him aloof from all friendships . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san - felice s steward , and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome , were expended in ear - rings , necklaces , and gold hairpins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so that , thanks to her friend s generosity , teresa was the most beautiful and the best - attired peasant near rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , in all their dreams , their wishes , and their conversations , vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel , general of an army , or governor of a province . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> teresa saw herself rich , superbly attired , and attended by a train of liveried domestics . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air , they separated their flocks , and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the steward gave him a gun; this was what vampa longed for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this gun had an excellent barrel , made at brescia , and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle; but one day the count broke the stock , and had then cast the gun aside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , however , was nothing to a sculptor like vampa; he examined the broken stock , calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder , and made a fresh stock , so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres , had he chosen to sell it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but nothing could be farther from his thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for a long time a gun had been the young man s greatest ambition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in every country where independence has taken the place of liberty , the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon , which at once renders him capable of defence or attack , and , by rendering its owner terrible , often makes him feared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> proud of this exploit , vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders , and carried him to the farm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these exploits had gained luigi considerable reputation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man of superior abilities always finds admirers , go where he will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet the two young people had never declared their affection; they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled , whose branches intertwined , and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only their wish to see each other had become a necessity , and they would have preferred death to a day s separation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - teresa was sixteen , and vampa seventeen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about this time , a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes a chief is wanted , but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the celebrated cucumetto , pursued in the abruzzo , driven out of the kingdom of naples , where he had carried on a regular war , had crossed the garigliano , like manfred , and had taken refuge on the banks of the amasine between sonnino and juperno . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he strove to collect a band of followers , and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone , whom he hoped to surpass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many young men of palestrina , frascati , and pampinara had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their disappearance at first caused much disquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after some time cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one day he carried off a young girl , the daughter of a surveyor of frosinone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom , a messenger is sent to negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger; should the ransom be refused , the prisoner is irrevocably lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she recognized her lover , the poor girl extended her arms to him , and believed herself safe; but carlini felt his heart sink , for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , as he was a favorite with cucumetto , as he had for three years faithfully served him , and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down , he hoped the chief would have pity on him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took cucumetto one side , while the young girl , seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest , made a veil of her picturesque head - dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cucumetto had been there , however , by accident , as he said , and had carried the maiden off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> carlini besought his chief to make an exception in rita s favor , as her father was rich , and could pay a large ransom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - carlini flew joyfully to rita , telling her she was saved , and bidding her write to her father , to inform him what had occurred , and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twelve hours  delay was all that was grantedthat is , until nine the next morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the instant the letter was written , carlini seized it , and hastened to the plain to find a messenger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found the troop in the glade , supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants; but his eye vainly sought rita and cucumetto among them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he inquired where they were , and was answered by a burst of laughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a cold perspiration burst from every pore , and his hair stood on end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he found rita senseless in the arms of cucumetto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the sight of carlini , cucumetto rose , a pistol in each hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two brigands looked at each other for a momentthe one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips , the other with the pallor of death on his brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent; but by degrees carlini s features relaxed , his hand , which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt , fell to his side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rita lay between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moon lighted the group . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at nine o clock tomorrow rita s father will be here with the money . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - it is well; in the meantime , we will have a merry night; this young girl is charming , and does credit to your taste . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - you have determined , then , to abandon her to the common law?   said carlini . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why should an exception be made in her favor?  <s> <s>  - i thought that my entreaties <s> <s>  - what right have you , any more than the rest , to ask for an exception?  <s> <s>  - it is true . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - but never mind ,  continued cucumetto , laughing , sooner or later your turn will come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , then ,  said cucumetto , advancing towards the other bandits , are you coming?  <s> <s>  - i follow you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - cucumetto departed , without losing sight of carlini , for , doubtless , he feared lest he should strike him unawares; but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlini s part . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was standing , his arms folded , near rita , who was still insensible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly; but this mattered little to him now rita had been his; and as for the money , three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - their demand was fair , and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand , and the red light of the fire made them look like demons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the names of all , including carlini , were placed in a hat , and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket; the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was the man who had proposed to carlini the health of their chief , and to whom carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a large wound , extending from the temple to the mouth , was bleeding profusely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - captain ,  said he , just now carlini would not drink your health when i proposed it to him; propose mine to him , and let us see if he will be more condescending to you than to me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - everyone expected an explosion on carlini s part; but to their great surprise , he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other , and filling it ,<s> <s>  - your health , diavolaccio ,  said he calmly , and he drank it off , without his hand trembling in the least . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - well done , carlini!   cried the brigands; that is acting like a good fellow;  and they all formed a circle round the fire , while diavolaccio disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her head hung back , and her long hair swept the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they entered the circle , the bandits could perceive , by the firelight , the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of diavolaccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this apparition was so strange and so solemn , that everyone rose , with the exception of carlini , who remained seated , and ate and drank calmly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence , and laid rita at the captain s feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a knife was plunged up to the hilt in rita s left breast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone looked at carlini; the sheath at his belt was empty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , ah ,  said the chief , i now understand why carlini stayed behind . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - all savage natures appreciate a desperate deed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , then ,  cried carlini , rising in his turn , and approaching the corpse , his hand on the butt of one of his pistols , does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me?  <s> <s>  - no ,  returned the chief , she is thine . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - carlini raised her in his arms , and carried her out of the circle of firelight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night , and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks , and lay down before the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm , and in an instant all were on the alert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here ,  said he , to cucumetto , here are three hundred piastres; give me back my child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man obeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they both advanced beneath the trees , through whose branches streamed the moonlight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cucumetto stopped at last , and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there ,  said he , demand thy child of carlini; he will tell thee what has become of her;  and he returned to his companions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length he advanced toward the group , the meaning of which he could not comprehend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he approached , carlini raised his head , and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man s eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a woman lay on the ground , her head resting on the knees of a man , who was seated by her; as he raised his head , the woman s face became visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i expected thee ,  said the bandit to rita s father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a ray of moonlight poured through the trees , and lighted up the face of the dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - cucumetto had violated thy daughter ,  said the bandit; i loved her , therefore i slew her; for she would have served as the sport of the whole band . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now ,  continued carlini , if i have done wrongly , avenge her;  and withdrawing the knife from the wound in rita s bosom , he held it out to the old man with one hand , while with the other he tore open his vest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thou hast done well!   returned the old man in a hoarse voice; embrace me , my son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now ,  said the old man , aid me to bury my child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the grave was formed , the father embraced her first , and then the lover; afterwards , one taking the head , the other the feet , they placed her in the grave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they knelt on each side of the grave , and said the prayers of the dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , when they had finished , they cast the earth over the corpse , until the grave was filled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , extending his hand , the old man said; i thank you , my son; and now leave me alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - leave me , i command you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - carlini obeyed , rejoined his comrades , folded himself in his cloak , and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it had been resolved the night before to change their encampment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but carlini would not quit the forest , without knowing what had become of rita s father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went toward the place where he had left him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he was unable to complete this oath , for two days afterwards , in an encounter with the roman carbineers , carlini was killed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was some surprise , however , that , as he was with his face to the enemy , he should have received a ball between his shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in carlini s rear when he fell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they told ten other stories of this bandit chief , each more singular than the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , from fondi to perusia , everyone trembles at the name of cucumetto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories; but vampa reassured her with a smile , tapping the butt of his good fowling - piece , which threw its ball so well; and if that did not restore her courage , he pointed to a crow , perched on some dead branch , took aim , touched the trigger , and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were both orphans , and had only their employers  leave to ask , which had been already sought and obtained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day when they were talking over their plans for the future , they heard two or three reports of firearms , and then suddenly a man came out of the wood , near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks , and hurried towards them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he came within hearing , he exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am pursued; can you conceal me?  <s> <s>  - they knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit; but there is an innate sympathy between the roman brigand and the roman peasant and the latter is always ready to aid the former . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instantly afterwards four carbineers , on horseback , appeared on the edge of the wood; three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive , while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the three carbineers looked about carefully on every side , saw the young peasants , and galloping up , began to question them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had seen no one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is very annoying ,  said the brigadier; for the man we are looking for is the chief . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - cucumetto?   cried luigi and teresa at the same moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the two young persons exchanged looks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the brigadier had a moment s hope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> five hundred roman crowns are three thousand lire , and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , it is very annoying ,  said vampa; but we have not seen him . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions , but in vain; then , after a time , they disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vampa then removed the stone , and cucumetto came out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers , and guessed the subject of their parley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had read in the countenances of luigi and teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him , and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold , which he offered to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but vampa raised his head proudly; as to teresa , her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the time of the carnival was at hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count of san - felice announced a grand masked ball , to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> teresa had a great desire to see this ball . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> luigi asked permission of his protector , the steward , that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was granted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ball was given by the count for the particular pleasure of his daughter carmela , whom he adored . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> carmela was precisely the age and figure of teresa , and teresa was as handsome as carmela . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the evening of the ball teresa was attired in her best , her most brilliant ornaments in her hair , and gayest glass beads ,she was in the costume of the women of frascati . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at each cross - path was an orchestra , and tables spread with refreshments; the guests stopped , formed quadrilles , and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> carmela was attired like a woman of sonnino . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her cap was embroidered with pearls , the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds , her girdle was of turkey silk , with large embroidered flowers , her bodice and skirt were of cashmere , her apron of indian muslin , and the buttons of her corset were of jewels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two of her companions were dressed , the one as a woman of nettuno , and the other as a woman of la riccia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were attired as peasants of albano , velletri , civita - castellana , and sora . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we need hardly add that these peasant costumes , like those of the young women , were brilliant with gold and jewels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> carmela looked all around her , but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own , or those of her companions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count of san - felice pointed out teresa , who was hanging on luigi s arm in a group of peasants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly ,  replied the count , are we not in carnival time?  <s> <s>  - carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her , and saying a few words to him , pointed with her finger to teresa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man looked , bowed in obedience , and then went to teresa , and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the count s daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> teresa felt a flush pass over her face; she looked at luigi , who could not refuse his assent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her cavalier; when their hands touched , he felt as though he should swoon; every pulse beat with violence , and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they spoke , although teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier , as luigi could read in the ardent looks of the good - looking young man that his language was that of praise , it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him , and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him , he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning , and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt , and which , unwittingly , he drew from the scabbard from time to time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - luigi was jealous! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the young peasant girl , at first timid and scared , soon recovered herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have said that teresa was handsome , but this is not all; teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had almost all the honors of the quadrille , and if she were envious of the count of san - felice s daughter , we will not undertake to say that carmela was not jealous of her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover s arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the quadrille had been most perfect , and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition , carmela alone objecting to it , but the count of san - felice besought his daughter so earnestly , that she acceded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa , without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed , but the young girl had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> teresa had yielded in spite of herself , but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man , she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she herself was not exempt from internal emotion , and without having done anything wrong , yet fully comprehended that luigi was right in reproaching her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , she did not know , but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - teresa , what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young countess of san - felice?  <s> <s>  - i thought ,  replied the young girl , with all the frankness of her nature , that i would give half my life for a costume such as she wore . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - and what said your cavalier to you?  <s> <s>  - he said it only depended on myself to have it , and i had only one word to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you desire it as ardently as you say?  <s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could , and when he had quite disappeared , she went into the house with a sigh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that night a memorable event occurred , due , no doubt , to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then returned to her room , calling for help as loudly as she could , when suddenly her window , which was twenty feet from the ground , was opened , a young peasant jumped into the chamber , seized her in his arms , and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass - plot , where she fainted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the servants surrounded her , offering her assistance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an entire wing of the villa was burnt down; but what of that , as long as carmela was safe and uninjured? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - her preserver was everywhere sought for , but he did not appear; he was inquired after , but no one had seen him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as the count was immensely rich , excepting the danger carmela had run ,and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped , made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real misfortune ,the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the next day , at the usual hour , the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> luigi arrived first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he came toward teresa in high spirits , and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - luigi took her arm beneath his own , and led her to the door of the grotto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he paused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl , perceiving that there was something extraordinary , looked at him steadfastly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - teresa ,  said luigi , yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the count s daughter . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - yes ,  replied the young girl , whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi , but of course your reply was only to please me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i have promised no more than i have given you , teresa ,  said luigi proudly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go into the grotto and dress yourself . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - at these words he drew away the stone , and showed teresa the grotto , lighted up by two wax lights , which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror; on a rustic table , made by luigi , were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins , and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he saw luigi , he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - luigi was not mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - luigi threw his cloak on the ground , placed his carbine on his shoulder , and freed from his heavy covering , preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer , which a horse can scarcely keep up with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on arriving there , with an air as majestic as that of an emperor , he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - well ,  replied the traveller , who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer , if you refuse wages , you will , perhaps , accept a gift . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - ah , yes , that is another thing . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - then ,  said the traveller , take these two venetian sequins and give them to your bride , to make herself a pair of earrings . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i accept it ,  answered the traveller , but then the obligation will be on my side , for this poniard is worth more than two sequins . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - for a dealer perhaps; but for me , who engraved it myself , it is hardly worth a piastre . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - what is your name?   inquired the traveller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - luigi vampa ,  replied the shepherd , with the same air as he would have replied , alexander , king of macedon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yours?  <s> <s>  - i ,  said the traveller , am called sinbad the sailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sinbad the sailor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the narrator;  - that was the name which the traveller gave to vampa as his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired albert;  - it is a very pretty name , and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth , i must confess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz said no more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the name of sinbad the sailor , as may well be supposed , awakened in him a world of recollections , as had the name of the count of monte cristo on the previous evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he to the host . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto , he thought he heard a cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he listened to know whence this sound could proceed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the cry proceeded from the grotto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he bounded like a chamois , cocking his carbine as he went , and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off teresa , as nessus , the centaur , carried deianira . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this man , who was hastening towards the wood , was already three - quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vampa measured the distance; the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him , and there was not a chance of overtaking him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young shepherd stopped , as if his feet had been rooted to the ground; then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder , took aim at the ravisher , followed him for a second in his track , and then fired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl rose instantly , but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vampa then rushed towards teresa; for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her , and she had dropped on her knees , so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy , had also wounded his betrothed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fortunately , she was unscathed , and it was fright alone that had overcome teresa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed , he turned towards the wounded man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had just expired , with clenched hands , his mouth in a spasm of agony , and his hair on end in the sweat of death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his eyes remained open and menacing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants , he had been enamoured of teresa , and had sworn she should be his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from that time he had watched them , and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone , had carried her off , and believed he at length had her in his power , when the ball , directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman , had pierced his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion; while , on the contrary , teresa , shuddering in every limb , dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees , and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly vampa turned toward his mistress: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah ,  said hegood , good! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are dressed; it is now my turn to dress myself . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san - felice s daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would , no doubt , have believed that he had returned to the times of florian , and would have declared , on reaching paris , that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the sabine hill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at the end of a quarter of an hour vampa quitted the grotto; his costume was no less elegant than that of teresa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - teresa uttered a cry of admiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vampa in this attire resembled a painting by lopold robert or schnetz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now ,  he said to teresa , are you ready to share my fortune , whatever it may be?  <s> <s>  - oh , yes!   exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and follow me wherever i go?  <s> <s>  - to the world s end . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her , for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome , proud , and powerful as a god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they went towards the forest , and soon entered it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa; he therefore went forward without a moment s hesitation , although there was no beaten track , but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes , and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a torrent , whose bed was dry , led into a deep gorge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vampa took this wild road , which , enclosed between two ridges , and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines , seemed , but for the difficulties of its descent , that path to avernus of which virgil speaks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her , and pressed closely against her guide , not uttering a syllable; but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance , she endeavored to repress her emotion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - suddenly , about ten paces from them , a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at vampa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not another step ,  he said , or you are a dead man . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - what , then ,  said vampa , raising his hand with a gesture of disdain , while teresa , no longer able to restrain her alarm , clung closely to him , do wolves rend each other?  <s> <s>  - who are you?   inquired the sentinel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am luigi vampa , shepherd of the san - felice farm . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - what do you want?  <s> <s>  - i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca bianca . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit , went before teresa , and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow; a croak answered this signal . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - luigi and teresa again set forward; as they went on teresa clung tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of carbines through the trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what has he to say?   inquired the young man who was in command in the chief s absence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherd s life ,  was vampa s reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , but i came to ask something more than to be your companion . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - and what may that be?   inquired the bandits with astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i come to ask to be your captain ,  said the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what have you done to aspire to this honor?   demanded the lieutenant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have killed your chief , cucumetto , whose dress i now wear; and i set fire to the villa san - felice to procure a wedding - dress for my betrothed . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - an hour afterwards luigi vampa was chosen captain , vice cucumetto , deceased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , my dear albert , said franz , turning towards his friend;  - what think you of citizen luigi vampa? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what may a myth be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired pastrini . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the explanation would be too long , my dear landlord , replied franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and how does he behave towards travellers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his plan is very simple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it depends on the distance he may be from the city , whether he gives eight hours , twelve hours , or a day wherein to pay their ransom; and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour s grace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the sixtieth minute of this hour , if the money is not forthcoming , he blows out the prisoner s brains with a pistol - shot , or plants his dagger in his heart , and that settles the account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , albert , inquired franz of his companion ,  - are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer wall? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the clock struck nine as the door opened , and a coachman appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , said franz ,  - let us to the colosseum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the streets , morbleu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the streets! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , the two young men went down the staircase , and got into the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this itinerary possessed another great advantage ,that of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrini s story , in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage , he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to , and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without , however , arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one fact more than the rest brought his friend  - sinbad the sailor back to his recollection , and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors; and pastrini s account of vampa s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen , reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht , which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto - vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the usual guide from the hotel having followed them , they had paid two conductors , nor is it possible , at rome , to avoid this abundant supply of guides; besides the ordinary cicerone , who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel , and never quits you while you remain in the city , there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monumentnay , almost to each part of a monument . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it may , therefore , be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum , that wonder of all ages , which martial thus eulogizes: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids , and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us; all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the csars , and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for albert and franz , they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants; and , indeed , it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage , as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum , while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian; and , to his credit be it spoken , his mind , even amid the glib loquacity of the guides , was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them , and more especially by moonlight , at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky , whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely , therefore , had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin , when , abandoning albert to the guides ( who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down , and as regularly followed by them , but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal , beginning , as a matter of course , with the  - lions  den , the  - hall of the gladiators and finishing with  - csar s podium ) , to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded , franz ascended a half - dilapidated staircase , and , leaving them to follow their monotonous round , seated himself at the foot of a column , and immediately opposite a large aperture , which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting - place , and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides , who , holding torches in their hands , had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum , and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins , resembling , as they glided along , some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot , and also that someone , who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard , was approaching the spot where he sat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it; but the hesitation with which he proceeded , stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took , convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were , the roof had given way , leaving a large round opening , through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven , thickly studded with stars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> around this opening , which had , possibly , for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile , grew a quantity of creeping plants , whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament , while large masses of thick , strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm , and hung floating to and fro , like so many waving strings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon , which , entering through the broken ceiling , shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather , over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i beg your excellency s pardon for keeping you waiting , said the man , in the roman dialect ,  - but i don t think i m many minutes after my time , ten o clock has just struck by the clock of saint john lateran . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking , said the man;  - i came here direct from the castle of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> angelo , and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who is beppo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are a provident person , i see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , you see , no one knows what may happen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps some of these days i may be entrapped , like poor peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net , and so help me out of prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - briefly , what did you learn? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two o clock , as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the culprits will be mazzolato;[3] he is an atrocious villain , who murdered the priest who brought him up , and deserves not the smallest pity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato;[4] and he , your excellency , is poor peppino . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the fact is , that you have inspired not only the pontifical government , but also the neighboring states , with such extreme fear , that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but peppino did not even belong to my band; he was merely a poor shepherd , whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but mark the distinction with which he is treated; instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you , he is simply sentenced to be guillotined , by which means , too , the amusements of the day are diversified , and there is a spectacle to please every spectator . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my good friend , said the man in the cloak ,  - excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain , and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what is your excellency s project? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and do you feel sure of succeeding? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pardieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what did your excellency say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i said , my good fellow , that i would do more single - handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos , pistols , carbines , and blunderbusses included . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - none whatever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - remember , the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow , and that you have but one day to work in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what of that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and how shall i know whether your excellency has succeeded or not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - send one of your men , disguised as a penitent friar , and i will give it to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency , said the man ,  - you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you , are you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , only fulfil your promise of rescuing peppino , and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion , but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let that day come sooner or later , your excellency will find me what i have found you in this my heavy trouble; and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing , you may regard it as done , for done it shall be , on the word and faith of<s> <s>  - hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> interrupted the stranger;  - i hear a noise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  tis some travellers , who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  twere better we should not be seen together; those guides are nothing but spies , and might possibly recognize you; and , however i may be honored by your friendship , my worthy friend , if once the extent of our intimacy were known , i am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , if you obtain the reprieve? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the middle window at the caf rospoli will be hung with white damask , bearing a red cross . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and if you fail? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then all three windows will have yellow draperies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then , my good fellow , use your daggers in any way you please , and i further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> adieu , your excellency; depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> saying these words , the transteverin disappeared down the staircase , while his companion , muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle , passed almost close to franz , and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in ten minutes after the strangers had departed , franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna , listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert , after the manner of pliny and calpurnius , touching the iron - pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz let him proceed without interruption , and , in fact , did not hear what was said; he longed to be alone , and free to ponder over all that had occurred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the two men , whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed , was an entire stranger to him , but not so the other; and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features , from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow , the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them , hear them when or where he might . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting , half bitter , that franz s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous , yet well - pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo , and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the more he thought , the more entire was his conviction , that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer ,  - sinbad the sailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> under any other circumstances , franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage , and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance; but in the present instance , the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him , with propriety , judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as we have seen , therefore , he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition , but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> slumber refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of monte cristo; and the more he thought , the firmer grew his opinion on the subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> worn out at length , he fell asleep at daybreak , and did not awake till late . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at five o clock albert returned , delighted with his day s work; he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction , and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept; besides this , he had seen ( as he called it ) all the remarkable sights at rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina , and also what performers appeared in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young men , therefore , had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of lucia di lammermoor , supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres , with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see , and the absence of balconies , or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes , and had shared a lower box at the opera . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success; but internally he was deeply wounded , and his self - love immensely piqued , to think that albert de morcerf , the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day , should thus be passed over , and merely have his labor for his pains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas , poor albert! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy , as elsewhere , there might be an exception to the general rule . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert , besides being an elegant , well - looking young man , was also possessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover , he was a viscounta recently created one , certainly , but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent , and a genealogical tree is equally estimated , whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815; but to crown all these advantages , albert de morcerf commanded an income of 50 ,000 livres , a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert , however , hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival , knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated , rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives , and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carnival was to commence on the morrow; therefore albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes , expectations , and claims to notice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the box taken by albert was in the first circle; although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic , and is , for this reason , generally styled the  - nobility s boxes , and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons , it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another motive had influenced albert s selection of his seat ,who knew but that , thus advantageously placed , he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman , and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage , or a place in a princely balcony , from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the truth was , that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival , with the  - holy week that was to succeed it , so filled every fair breast , as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of; at certain conventional moments , the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation , or rouse themselves from their musings , to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani s , a well - executed recitative by coselli , or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia; but that momentary excitement over , they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> towards the close of the first act , the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened; a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris , where indeed , he had imagined she still was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know the woman who has just entered that box? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; what do you think of her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and such magnificent hair! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is she french? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; a venetian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , i know her by name! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall i assist you in repairing your negligence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life; but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at that instant , the countess perceived franz , and graciously waved her hand to him , to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , said albert ,  - you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are mistaken in thinking so , returned franz calmly;  - but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders ,i mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions; believe me , nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countessnothing more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is there , indeed , my good fellow? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray tell me , is it sympathy of heart? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; of taste , continued franz gravely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you were with her , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , cried albert ,  - you must have been a very entertaining companion alone , or all but alone , with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum , and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all i can say is , if ever i should get such a chance , the living should be my theme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you will probably find your theme ill - chosen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said albert , breaking in upon his discourse ,  - never mind the past; let us only remember the present . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , directly the curtain falls on the stage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a confounded long time this first act lasts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i believe , on my soul , that they never mean to finish it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , they will; only listen to that charming finale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what an awkward , inelegant fellow he is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , what do you say to la specchia? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , you know , my dear fellow , when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag , such singers as these don t make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at least , you must admire moriani s style and execution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my good friend , said franz , turning to him , while albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre ,  - you seem determined not to approve; you are really too difficult to please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curtain at length fell on the performances , to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of morcerf , who seized his hat , rapidly passed his fingers through his hair , arranged his cravat and wristbands , and signified to franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz , who had mutely interrogated the countess , and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome , sought not to retard the gratification of albert s eager impatience , but began at once the tour of the house , closely followed by albert , who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar , and to arrange the lappets of his coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess s box . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day , both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents; nor did he say more than the truth , for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved , he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the countess , in reply , bowed gracefully to albert , and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz; then , inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her , she recommended franz to take the next best , if he wished to view the ballet , and pointed to the one behind her own chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters , speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz perceived how completely he was in his element; and , unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt , took up albert s glass , and began in his turn to survey the audience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind her , but in deep shadow , was the outline of a masculine figure; but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert , to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite , since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all i can tell about her , replied the countess ,  - is , that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season; for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season , and since then she has never missed a performance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her , and at others she is merely attended by a black servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what do you think of her personal appearance? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i consider her perfectly lovelyshe is just my idea of what medora must have been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and the countess exchanged a smile , and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert , while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curtain rose on the ballet , which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school , admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri , who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic artone of those masterly productions of grace , method , and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet , from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary , are all engaged on the stage at the same time; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude , or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement , that would lead you to suppose that but one mind , one act of volition , influenced the moving mass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ballet at length came to a close , and the curtain fell amid the loud , unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet , the pauses between the performances are very short , the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume , when necessary , while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the overture to the second act began; and , at the first sound of the leader s bow across his violin , franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl , who turned around to say a few words to him , and then , leaning forward again on the railing of her box , she became as absorbed as before in what was going on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade , that , though franz tried his utmost , he could not distinguish a single feature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curtain rose , and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors; and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this duet is one of the most beautiful , expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz now listened to it for the third time; yet its notes , so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions , thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> excited beyond his usual calm demeanor , franz rose with the audience , and was about to join the loud , enthusiastic applause that followed; but suddenly his purpose was arrested , his hands fell by his sides , and the half - uttered  - bravos expired on his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed; for he left his seat to stand up in front , so that , his countenance being fully revealed , franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo , and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum , and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of franz s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features; for the countess , after gazing with a puzzled look at his face , burst into a fit of laughter , and begged to know what had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - countess , returned franz , totally unheeding her raillery ,  - i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite; i must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , answered the countess ,  - i know no more of him than yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps you never before noticed him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a questionso truly french! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , replied franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all i can say is , continued the countess , taking up the lorgnette , and directing it toward the box in question ,  - that the gentleman , whose history i am unable to furnish , seems to me as though he had just been dug up; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave - digger to quit his tomb for a while , and revisit this earth of ours , than anything human . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , he is always as colorless as you now see him , said franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you know him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , pray do , for heaven s sake , tell us all aboutis he a vampire , or a resuscitated corpse , or what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i can well understand , said the countess , shrugging up her beautiful shoulders , as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins ,  - that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself; another , and wholly uninterested person , felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this fresh allusion to byron[5] drew a smile to franz s countenance; although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires , it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must positively find out who and what he is , said franz , rising from his seat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , cried the countess;  - you must not leave me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i depend upon you to escort me home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it possible , whispered franz ,  - that you entertain any fear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll tell you , answered the countess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires , and even assured me that he had seen them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the coal - black hair , large bright , glittering eyes , in which a wild , unearthly fire seems burning ,the same ghastly paleness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then observe , too , that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is a foreignera stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nobody knows who she is , or where she comes from . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does , and is , like himself , a dealer in magical arts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i entreat of you not to go near himat least tonight; and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great , pursue your researches if you will; but tonight you neither can nor shall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day , for many reasons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen to me , said the countess ,  - and do not be so very headstrong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am going home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , i cannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat , open the door of the box , and offer the countess his arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was quite evident , by her manner , that her uneasiness was not feigned; and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dreadso much the stronger in him , as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections , while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief , originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon arriving at her hotel , franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company; on the contrary , her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excuse my little subterfuge , said the countess , in reply to her companion s half - reproachful observation on the subject;  - but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable , and i longed to be alone , that i might compose my startled mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz essayed to smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , said she ,  - do not smile; it ill accords with the expression of your countenance , and i am sure it does not spring from your heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , promise me one thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - promise me , i say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will do anything you desire , except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where he comes from i am ignorant; but i can readily tell you where he is going to , and that is down below , without the least doubt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make , said franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel , and make no attempt to follow this man tonight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for heaven s sake , do not serve as a conductor between that man and me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now , good - night; go to your rooms , and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , the countess quitted franz , leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense , or whether her fears and agitations were genuine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear fellow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried he , springing up ,  - is it really you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , i did not expect to see you before tomorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear albert , replied franz ,  - i am glad of this opportunity to tell you , once and forever , that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my soul , these women would puzzle the very devil to read them aright . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , herethey give you their handthey press yours in returnthey keep up a whispering conversationpermit you to accompany them home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention , her reputation would be gone forever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely greek girl? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , for my part , i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece; and hang me , if i can guess where you took your notions of the other world from . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine - looking fellowadmirably dressed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , i feel quite sure , from the cut of his clothes , they are made by a first - rate paris tailorprobably blin or humann . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz smiled; for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did he speak in your hearing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did; but they were uttered in the romaic dialect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i knew that from the mixture of greek words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i don t know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was ratherrather strong in greek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he spoke the romaic language , did he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that settles it , murmured franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  tis he , past all doubt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing , nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but tell me , what were you thinking about when i came in? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly; and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , then , in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i tell you what , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz , cried albert ,  - you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , hearken to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you agree , do you not , that obtaining a carriage is out of the question? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - neither can we procure horses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , now , what do you say to a cart? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i dare say such a thing might be had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and a pair of oxen? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as easily found as the cart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you see , my good fellow , with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cart must be tastefully ornamented; and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers , we may get up a striking tableau , after the manner of that splendid picture by lopold robert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and quite a national one , too , replied albert with gratified pride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha , ha , ye romans! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you thought to make us , unhappy strangers , trot at the heels of your processions , like so many lazzaroni , because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - only to our host . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon my return home i sent for him , and i then explained to him what i wished to procure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one thing i was sorry for; when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded , he told me there would not be time , as it would require three days to do that; so you see we must do without this little superfluity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and where is he now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who? </s> </s>

<s> <s> asked franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - speak out , there s a worthy fellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellencies are aware , responded the landlord , swelling with importance ,  - that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should think we did know it , exclaimed albert ,  - since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms , like two poor students in the back streets of paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when , then , the count of monte cristo , hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed , has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but do you think , asked albert ,  - that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked franz of his host . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a very great nobleman , but whether maltese or sicilian i cannot exactly say; but this i know , that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems to me , said franz , speaking in an undertone to albert ,  - that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord , he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel , and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would have writtenor<s> <s> at this instant someone knocked at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come in , said franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a servant , wearing a livery of considerable style and richness , appeared at the threshold , and , placing two cards in the landlord s hands , who forthwith presented them to the two young men , he said: </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - that is what i call an elegant mode of attack , said albert ,  - you were quite correct in what you said , signor pastrini . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count of monte cristo is unquestionably a man of first - rate breeding and knowledge of the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you accept his offer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the host . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course we do , replied albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and were it not for the windows at the palazzo rospoli , by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme , i don t know but what i should have held on by my original plan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what say you , franz? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the truth was , that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin , in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal; and if this muffled - up individual proved ( as franz felt sure he would ) the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina , then he should be able to establish his identity , and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor , and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day must clear up every doubt; and unless his near neighbor and would - be friend , the count of monte cristo , possessed the ring of gyges , and by its power was able to render himself invisible , it was very certain he could not escape this time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eight o clock found franz up and dressed , while albert , who had not the same motives for early rising , was still soundly asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first act of franz was to summon his landlord , who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , your excellency; but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from , you are much too late . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , answered franz ,  - i had no such intention; and even if i had felt a wish to witness the spectacle , i might have done so from monte pincio; could i not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed mine host ,  - i did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill , which , indeed , they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very possibly i may not go , answered franz;  - but in case i feel disposed , give me some particulars of today s executions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what particulars would your excellency like to hear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , the number of persons condemned to suffer , their names , and description of the death they are to die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that happens just lucky , your excellency! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the reason for so publicly announcing all this is , that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits , and , above all , beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful , are they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked franz somewhat incredulously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , dear , no , your excellency! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , your excellency , returned the landlord , chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency ,  - i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see that plainly enough , my most excellent host , and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile , oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency s wish , said the landlord , opening the door of the chamber;  - i have caused one to be placed on the landing , close by your apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , taking the tablet from the wall , he handed it to franz , who read as follows: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the public is informed that on wednesday , february 23rd , being the first day of the carnival , executions will take place in the piazza del popolo , by order of the tribunal of the rota , of two persons , named andrea rondolo , and peppino , otherwise called rocca priori; the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest , named don csar torlini , canon of the church of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> john lateran; and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit , luigi vampa , and his band . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first - named malefactor will be mazzolato , the second culprit decapitato . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men , that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt , and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no part of the programme differed ,the names of the condemned persons , their crimes , and mode of punishment , all agreed with his previous information . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in all probability , therefore , the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself , and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as  - sinbad the sailor , but who , no doubt , was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome , as he had already done at porto - vecchio and tunis . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> time was getting on , however , and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert; but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber , his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - most assuredly , replied he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count of monte cristo is always an early riser; and i can answer for his having been up these two hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i am quite sure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , if it be so , are you ready , albert? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perfectly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , let us do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i signori francesi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they passed through two rooms , furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected to see under the roof of signor pastrini , and were shown into an elegantly fitted - up drawing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the richest turkey carpets covered the floor , and the softest and most inviting couches , easy - chairs , and sofas , offered their high - piled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refreshment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls , intermingled with magnificent trophies of war , while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if your excellencies will please to be seated , said the man ,  - i will let the count know that you are here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portires . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the door opened , the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young men , but was almost immediately lost , for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other , then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , upon my soul , my dear fellow , it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock - jobber who has speculated in the fall of the spanish funds , or some prince travelling incog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied franz;  - we shall ascertain who and what he ishe comes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert instantly rose to meet him , but franz remained , in a manner , spellbound on his chair; for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum , and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina , but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , returned the count , motioning the two young men to sit down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was the fault of that blockhead pastrini , that i did not sooner assist you in your distress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you , i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two young men bowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz had , as yet , found nothing to say; he had come to no determination , and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him , he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past , or wait until he had more proof; besides , although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening , he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he resolved , therefore , to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , he had this advantage , he was master of the count s secret , while the count had no hold on franz , who had nothing to conceal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , said he ,  - you have offered us places in your carriage , and at your windows in the rospoli palace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said the count negligently , looking attentively at morcerf ,  - is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stay , i think i told my steward yesterday to attend to this; perhaps i can render you this slight service also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he extended his hand , and rang the bell thrice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you ever occupy yourself , said he to franz ,  - with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here he is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man of about forty - five or fifty entered , exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced franz into the cavern; but he did not appear to recognize him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was evident he had his orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur bertuccio , said the count ,  - you have procured me windows looking on the piazza del popolo , as i ordered you yesterday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , excellency , returned the steward;  - but it was very late . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and your excellency has one , which was let to prince lobanieff; but i was obliged to pay a hundred<s> <s>  - that will dothat will do , monsieur bertuccio; spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give orders to the coachman; and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the steward bowed , and was about to quit the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is no need to do that , said franz , taking out his tablets;  - for i saw the account , and copied it down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well , you can retire , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us know when breakfast is ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not at all; on the contrary , you will give me great pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will , one or other of you , perhaps both , return it to me at paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we announce ,  he read , in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper , that today , the 23rd of february , will be executed andrea rondolo , guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don csar torlini , canon of the church of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> john lateran , and peppino , called rocca priori , convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit luigi vampa , and the men of his band . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - hum! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  yes , continued the count ,  - it was at first arranged in this way; but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for andrea rondolo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , added the count , in a contemptuous tone ,  - do not tell me of european punishments , they are in the infancy , or rather the old age , of cruelty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really , count , replied franz ,  - one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my first sentiment was horror , the second indifference , the third curiosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - curiositythat is a terrible word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for myself , i can assure you of one thing ,the more men you see die , the easier it becomes to die yourself; and in my opinion , death may be a torture , but it is not an expiation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , said the count , and deep hatred mounted to his face , as the blood would to the face of any other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if a man had by unheard - of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father , your mother , your betrothed ,a being who , when torn from you , left a desolation , a wound that never closes , in your breast ,do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer , and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will put another case to you , continued the count;  - that where society , attacked by the death of a person , avenges death by death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> answer me , do not these crimes exist? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , answered franz;  - and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , duelling , cried the count;  - a pleasant manner , upon my soul , of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man has carried off your mistress , a man has seduced your wife , a man has dishonored your daughter; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures , an existence of misery and infamy; and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head , or pass a sword through the breast , of that man who has planted madness in your brain , and despair in your heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and remember , moreover , that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife , absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you disapprove of duelling? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , replied the count;  - understand me , i would fight a duel for a trifle , for an insult , for a blow; and the more so that , thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises , and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired , i should be almost certain to kill my man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , i would fight for such a cause; but in return for a slow , profound , eternal torture , i would give back the same , were it possible; an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , as the orientalists say ,our masters in everything ,those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said franz to the count ,  - with this theory , which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause , it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hatred is blind , rage carries you away; and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what matters this punishment , as long as he is avenged? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on my word , i almost regret that in all probability this miserable peppino will not be beheaded , as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts , and whether it is worth even mentioning; but , really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival , gentlemen; how did it arise? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two young men arose and entered the breakfast - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the meal , which was excellent , and admirably served , franz looked repeatedly at albert , in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer; but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him , whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him , or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone , he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them , but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookerythat is , the worst in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this brought back to franz , in spite of himself , the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g , and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the count ,  - what are you doing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we have no masks , and it is absolutely necessary to procure them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - before or after , whichever you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - opposite the scaffold? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the scaffold forms part of the fte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , i have reflected on the matter , said franz ,  - i thank you for your courtesy , but i shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace , and i leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del popolo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i warn you , you will lose a very curious sight , returned the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will describe it to me , replied franz ,  - and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if i had witnessed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have more than once intended witnessing an execution , but i have never been able to make up my mind; and you , albert? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i , replied the viscount , - i saw castaing executed , but i think i was rather intoxicated that day , for i had quitted college the same morning , and we had passed the previous night at a tavern . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> think what a figure you will make when you are asked , how do they execute at rome?   and you reply , i do not know!   and , besides , they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel , who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> diable! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when a churchman is killed , it should be with a different weapon than a log , especially when he has behaved like a father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you went to spain , would you not see the bull - fights? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , suppose it is a bull - fight you are going to see? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> recollect the ancient romans of the circus , and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators , the sage matrons who took their daughters , and the charming vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said , come , despatch the dying . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - shall you go , then , albert? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi , yes; like you , i hesitated , but the count s eloquence decides me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it important that you should go that way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , there is something i wish to see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo , by the via del babuino , for i shall be glad to pass , myself , through the corso , to see if some orders i have given have been executed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , returned the count ,  - i know who he is , gentlemen; will you return to the salon? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will be with you directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert , who was a great smoker , and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the caf de paris , approached the table , and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , asked franz ,  - what think you of the count of monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do i think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such was albert s opinion of the count , and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection , he made no attempt to change it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how attentively he looked at you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert reflected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first opportunity you have , undeceive him , i beg , and tell him i am nothing of the kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz smiled; an instant after the count entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo , and we will go another; and , if you please , by the corso . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take some more of these cigars , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , we have not any time to lose , it is half - past twelvelet us set off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all three descended; the coachman received his master s orders , and drove down the via del babuino . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which are your windows? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the three last , returned he , with a negligence evidently unaffected , for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin , and there could now be no doubt that he was the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the three windows were still untenanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> preparations were making on every side; chairs were placed , scaffolds were raised , and windows were hung with flags . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz , albert , and the count continued to descend the corso . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they approached the piazza del popolo , the crowd became more dense , and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible: the obelisk , surmounted by a cross , which marks the centre of the square , and in front of the obelisk , at the point where the three streets , del babuino , del corso , and di ripetta , meet , the two uprights of the scaffold , between which glittered the curved knife of the mandaa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the window , let at an exorbitant price , which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests , was on the second floor of the great palace , situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it consisted , as we have said , of a small dressing - room , opening into a bedroom , and , when the door of communication was shut , the inmates were quite alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as you left the choice of your costumes to me , said the count to the two friends ,  - i have had these brought , as they will be the most worn this year; and they are most suitable , on account of the confetti ( sweetmeats ) , as they do not show the flour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[7] the knife , which is shaped like a crescent , that cuts with the convex side , falls from a less height , and that is all the difference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these two men were the executioner s assistants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a double line of carbineers , placed on each side of the door of the church , reached to the scaffold , and formed a circle around it , leaving a path about ten feet wide , and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators; the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed; the steps even seemed a parti - colored sea , that was impelled towards the portico; every niche in the wall held its living statue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what the count said was truethe most curious spectacle in life is that of death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was evident that the execution was , in the eyes of the people , only the commencement of the carnival . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly the tumult ceased , as if by magic , and the doors of the church opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a brotherhood of penitents , clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth , with holes for the eyes , and holding in their hands lighted tapers , appeared first; the chief marched at the head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was naked , with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath , and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge - hammer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man was the executioner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had , moreover , sandals bound on his feet by cords . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind the executioner came , in the order in which they were to die , first peppino and then andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea was supported by two priests . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each of them , from time to time , kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he looked at alberthe was as white as his shirt , and mechanically cast away his cigar , although he had not half smoked it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count alone seemed unmovednay , more , a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey , and his lips , half opened , disclosed his white teeth , small and sharp like those of a jackal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness , such as franz had never before witnessed in them; his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino was a handsome young man of four or five - and - twenty , bronzed by the sun; he carried his head erect , and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea was short and fat; his visage , marked with brutal cruelty , did not indicate age; he might be thirty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thought , said franz to the count ,  - that you told me there would be but one execution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i told you true , replied he coldly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and yet here are two culprits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but only one of these two is about to die; the other has many years to live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and see , here it is , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the mandaa , a priest arrived in some haste , forced his way through the soldiers , and , advancing to the chief of the brotherhood , gave him a folded paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the chief took the paper , unfolded it , and , raising his hand ,  - heaven be praised , and his holiness also , said he in a loud voice;  - here is a pardon for one of the prisoners! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this cry andrea raised his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pardon for whom? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino remained breathless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a pardon for peppino , called rocca priori , said the principal friar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers , who read and returned it to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for peppino! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried andrea , who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why for him and not for me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we ought to die together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have no right to put me to death alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will not die alonei will not! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast , and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the executioner made a sign , and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is going on? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked franz of the count; for , as all the talk was in the roman dialect , he had not perfectly understood it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you not see? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , were he able , he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , man , manrace of crocodiles , cried the count , extending his clenched hands towards the crowd ,  - how well do i recognize you there , and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground , and he kept exclaiming ,  - he ought to die! he shall die! i will not die alone! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look , look , cried the count , seizing the young men s hands;  - look , for on my soul it is curious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate , who was going to the scaffold to dielike a coward , it is true , but he was about to die without resistance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you know what gave him strength? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you know what consoled him? </s> </s>

<s> <s> the two assistants had borne andrea to the scaffold , and there , in spite of his struggles , his bites , and his cries , had forced him to his knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during this time the executioner had raised his mace , and signed to them to get out of the way; the criminal strove to rise , but , ere he had time , the mace fell on his left temple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a dull and heavy sound was heard , and the man dropped like an ox on his face , and then turned over on his back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert , with his eyes closed , was standing grasping the window - curtains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count was erect and triumphant , like the avenging angel! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when franz recovered his senses , he saw albert drinking a glass of water , of which , to judge from his pallor , he stood in great need; and the count , who was assuming his masquerade costume . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he glanced mechanically towards the piazzathe scene was wholly changed; scaffold , executioners , victims , all had disappeared; only the people remained , full of noise and excitement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bell of monte citorio , which only sounds on the pope s decease and the opening of the carnival , was ringing a joyous peal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing , replied the count;  - only , as you see , the carnival has commenced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make haste and dress yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is but a dream , a nightmare , that has disturbed you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , that i have suffered; but the culprit? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is a dream also; only he has remained asleep , while you have awakened; and who knows which of you is the most fortunate? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - peppino is a lad of sense , who , unlike most men , who are happy in proportion as they are noticed , was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - but i am really glad to have seen such a sight; and i understand what the count saidthat when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle , it is the only one that causes you any emotion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character , said the count;  - on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life , and the real visage is disclosed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it must be allowed that andrea was not very handsome , the hideous scoundrel! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions  example . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he assumed his costume , and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their toilet finished , they descended; the carriage awaited them at the door , filled with sweetmeats and bouquets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they fell into the line of carriages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death , the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry . </s> </s>

<s> <s> they saw , or rather continued to see , the image of what they had witnessed; but little by little the general vertigo seized them , and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage , and which , while it covered morcerf and his two companions with dust , pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins , incited him to join in the general combat , in which all the masks around him were engaged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he rose in his turn , and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats , with which the carriage was filled , cast them with all the force and skill he was master of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the strife had fairly begun , and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men s minds , so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the count of monte cristo , he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lovely women , yielding to the influence of the scene , bend over their balconies , or lean from their windows , and shower down confetti , which are returned by bouquets; the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumesgigantic cabbages walk gravely about , buffaloes  heads bellow from men s shoulders , dogs walk on their hind legs; in the midst of all this a mask is lifted , and , as in callot s temptation of st . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this will give a faint idea of the carnival at rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the second turn , the count stopped the carriage , and requested permission to withdraw , leaving the vehicle at their disposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentlemen , said the count , springing out ,  - when you are tired of being actors , and wish to become spectators of this scene , you know you have places at my windows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the meantime , dispose of my coachman , my carriage , and my servants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have forgotten to mention , that the count s coachman was attired in a bear - skin , exactly resembling odry s in the bear and the pasha; and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys , with spring masks , with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz thanked the count for his attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for albert , he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there ,that calash filled with roman peasants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , in spite of albert s hope , the day passed unmarked by any incident , excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at one of these encounters , accidentally or purposely , albert s mask fell off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert seized it , and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him , he suffered albert to retain it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert placed it in his button - hole , and the carriage went triumphantly on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said franz to him;  - there is the beginning of an adventure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - laugh if you pleasei really think so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jest , however , soon appeared to become earnest; for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini , the one who had thrown the violets to albert , clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button - hole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall i leave you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps you would prefer being alone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied he;  - i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock , as they say at the opera - balls . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further , we shall find her , or rather , she will find us tomorrow; then she will give me some sign or other , and i shall know what i have to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on my word , said franz ,  - you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses , and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert was right; the fair unknown had resolved , doubtless , to carry the intrigue no farther; for although the young men made several more turns , they did not again see the calash , which had turned up one of the neighboring streets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the file on the corso broke the line , and in a second all the carriages had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and albert were opposite the via delle muratte; the coachman , without saying a word , drove up it , passed along the piazza di spagna and the rospoli palace and stopped at the door of the hotel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> signor pastrini came to the door to receive his guests . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count had , moreover , charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz questioned albert as to his intentions; but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre; and instead of making any answer , he inquired if signor pastrini could procure him a tailor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a tailor , said the host;  - and for what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the host shook his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ask your excellencies  pardon , but this is quite a french demand; for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i must give up the idea? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; we have them ready - made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leave all to me; and tomorrow , when you awake , you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear albert , said franz ,  - leave all to our host; he has already proved himself full of resources; let us dine quietly , and afterwards go and see l italienne  alger! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - agreed , returned albert;  - but remember , signor pastrini , that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the host again assured them they might rely on him , and that their wishes should be attended to; upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments , and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert , as he took off his dress , carefully preserved the bunch of violets; it was his token reserved for the morrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two friends sat down to table; but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristo s table and that of signor pastrini . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> truth compelled franz , in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count , to confess that the advantage was not on pastrini s side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert and franz looked at each other , fearing really to abuse the count s kindness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servant understood them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his excellency the count of monte cristo had , he said ,  - given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships  orders all day , and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they resolved to profit by the count s courtesy , and ordered the horses to be harnessed , while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on , and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the first act , the countess g entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening , so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely had they entered , when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert , in his turn , sat behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said she , hardly giving franz time to sit down ,  - it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven , and you are already the best friends in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a long story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell it to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at least wait until the story has a conclusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did anyone introduce you to him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; it was he who introduced himself to us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - last night , after we left you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the very prosaic one of our landlord . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not only in the same hotel , but on the same floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is not a family name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , it is the name of the island he has purchased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a tuscan count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what sort of a man is he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ask the vicomte de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you hear , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf , i am referred to you , said the countess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a friend of ten years  standing could not have done more for us , or with a more perfect courtesy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , observed the countess , smiling ,  - i see my vampire is only some millionaire , who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de rothschild; and you have seen her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; we heard , i think , the sound of her guzla , but she remained perfectly invisible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when you say invisible , interrupted albert ,  - it is only to keep up the mystery; for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where was this window with white hangings? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the countess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at the rospoli palace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count had three windows at the rospoli palace? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you pass through the corso? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask , and one with white damask with a red cross? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , he must be a nabob . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you know what those three windows were worth? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - two or three hundred roman crowns? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - two or three thousand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - does his island produce him such a revenue? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then why did he purchase it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for a whim . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is an original , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in reality , observed albert ,  - he seemed to me somewhat eccentric; were he at paris , and a frequenter of the theatres , i should say he was a poor devil literally mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this circumstance had , moreover , the effect of changing the conversation; an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow; and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning , at nine o clock , he entered franz s room , followed by a tailor , who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm; they selected two exactly alike , and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon , and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fte days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes , but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin , and their red caps , which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz complimented albert , who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were thus engaged when the count of monte cristo entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentlemen , said he ,  - although a companion is agreeable , perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i come to say that today , and for the remainder of the carnival , i leave the carriage entirely at your disposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the host will tell you i have three or four more , so that you will not inconvenience me in any way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make use of it , i pray you , for your pleasure or your business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count of monte cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them , conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a glance at the walls of his salon proved to franz and albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences , and he seemed much occupied with chemistry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them; it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor pastrini . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they told him so frankly , and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button - hole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the second turn , a bunch of fresh violets , thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins , indicated to albert that , like himself and his friend , the peasants had changed their costume also; and whether it was the result of chance , or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both , while he had donned their costume , they had assumed his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day was as gay as the preceding one , perhaps even more animated and noisy; the count appeared for an instant at his window , but when they again passed he had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the evening , on his return , franz found a letter from the embassy , informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at each previous visit he had made to rome , he had solicited and obtained the same favor; and incited as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude , he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not then think of the carnival , for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness , one cannot incline one s self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called gregory xvi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on his return from the vatican , franz carefully avoided the corso; he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts , to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at ten minutes past five albert entered overjoyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the harlequin had reassumed her peasant s costume , and as she passed she raised her mask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was charming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz congratulated albert , who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs , that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz remarked , while he gave these details , that albert seemed to have something to ask of him , but that he was unwilling to ask it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he insisted upon it , declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required , and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert attributed to franz s absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened; and as , during three years that he had travelled all over italy , a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share , franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he therefore promised albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the windows of the rospoli palace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning he saw albert pass and repass , holding an enormous bouquet , which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet ( conspicuous by a circle of white camellias ) in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose - colored satin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the evening was no longer joy , but delirium . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him , and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert was not deceived , for the next evening franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she has answered you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - read . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz took the letter , and read: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tuesday evening , at seven o clock , descend from your carriage opposite the via dei pontefici , and follow the roman peasant who snatches your torch from you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you arrive at the first step of the church of san giacomo , be sure to fasten a knot of rose - colored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume , in order that you may be recognized . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> until then you will not see me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> constancy and discretion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think so , also , replied albert;  - and i very much fear you will go alone to the duke of bracciano s ball . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all the nobility of rome will be present , and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society , she must go there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whether she goes there or not , my opinion is still the same , returned albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ( this is the name of the lower class . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look at the writing , and find if you can , any blemish in the language or orthography . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the writing was , in reality , charming , and the orthography irreproachable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are born to good fortune , said franz , as he returned the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - laugh as much as you will , replied albert ,  - i am in love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of bracciano s , but also return to florence alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful , said albert ,  - i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks , at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i adore rome , and i have always had a great taste for archology . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert s love had not taken away his appetite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after dinner , the count of monte cristo was announced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had not seen him for two days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> signor pastrini informed them that business had called him to civita vecchia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was charming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether he kept a watch over himself , or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched , he was tonight like everybody else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count must feel sure that franz recognized him; and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on his side , however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview , the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre , and were told they were all let . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and albert made some difficulty , alleging their fear of depriving him of it; but the count replied that , as he was going to the palli theatre , the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this assurance determined the two friends to accept it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features , the only defect , or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> truly , a byronic hero! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz could not , we will not say see him , but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfred s shoulders , or beneath lara s helmet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet , the count seemed to have the power of fascination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz was less enthusiastic; but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris; and he had no doubt but that , with his eccentric character , his characteristic face , and his colossal fortune , he would produce a great effect there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres; that is , not in listening to the music , but in paying visits and conversing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy , if we may credit travellers , the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity , but congratulated albert on his success . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they promised , upon separating , to meet at the duke of bracciano s ball , to which all rome was invited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the heroine of the bouquet kept her word; she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length tuesday came , the last and most tumultuous day of the carnival . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on tuesday , the theatres open at ten o clock in the morning , as lent begins after eight at night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from two o clock till five franz and albert followed in the fte , exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians , who crowded amongst the horses  feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident , a single dispute , or a single fight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the author of this history , who has resided five or six years in italy , does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a knot of rose - colored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the day advanced , the tumult became greater . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a human storm , made up of a thunder of cries , and a hail of sweetmeats , flowers , eggs , oranges , and nosegays . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at three o clock the sound of fireworks , let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia ( heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion ) announced that the races were about to begin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the races , like the moccoli , are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks , and retired by the adjacent streets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity , without the police interfering in the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls; then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a detachment of carbineers , fifteen abreast , galloped up the corso in order to clear it for the barberi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia , a second volley of fireworks was discharged , to announce that the street was clear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> immediately , without any other signal , the carriages moved on , flowing on towards the corso , down all the streets , like torrents pent up for a while , which again flow into the parent river; and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moccoli , or moccoletti , are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight , and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple with ,first , how to keep his own moccoletto alight; and secondly , how to extinguish the moccoletti of others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moccoletto is like life: man has found but one means of transmitting it , and that one comes from god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors , two or three stars began to burn among the crowd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered , descending from the palazzo di venezia to the piazza del popolo , and mounting from the piazza del popolo to the palazzo di venezia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth; the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had old olus appeared at this moment , he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli , and aquilo the heir - presumptive to the throne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this battle of folly and flame continued for two hours; the corso was light as day; the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert sprang out , bearing his moccoletto in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz was too far off to hear what they said; but , without doubt , nothing hostile passed , for he saw albert disappear arm - in - arm with the peasant girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he watched them pass through the crowd for some time , but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded , and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home; nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carnival was over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by a chance , which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness , the moon , which was on the wane , did not rise until eleven o clock , and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> signor pastrini , who had been accustomed to see them dine together , inquired into the cause of his absence , but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at eleven o clock albert had not come back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz dressed himself , and went out , telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of bracciano s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the house of the duke of bracciano is one of the most delightful in rome , the duchess , one of the last heiresses of the colonnas , does its honors with the most consummate grace , and thus their ftes have a european celebrity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and albert had brought to rome letters of introduction to them , and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli , and that he had lost sight of him in the via macello . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i waited for him until this hour , replied franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and do you know whither he went? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , not precisely; however , i think it was something very like a rendezvous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - diavolo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the duke ,  - this is a bad day , or rather a bad night , to be out late; is it not , countess? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think , on the contrary , that it is a charming night , replied the countess ,  - and those who are here will complain of but one thing , that of its too rapid flight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , asked the countess ,  - who is out in the streets of rome at this hour , unless it be to go to a ball? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and don t you know where he is? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is he armed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is in masquerade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you should not have allowed him to go , said the duke to franz;  - you , who know rome better than he does . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who can tell? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the night is gloomy , and the tiber is very near the via macello . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i informed them at the hotel that i had the honor of passing the night here , duke , said franz ,  - and desired them to come and inform me of his return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency , he said ,  - the master of the htel de londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the viscount of morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a letter from the viscount! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who is the man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why did he not bring it to me here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said the countess to franz ,  - go with all speedpoor young man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps some accident has happened to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall we see you again to give us any information? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the countess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , if it is not any serious affair , otherwise i cannot answer as to what i may do myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray be assured of that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz took his hat and went away in haste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he came near the hotel , franz saw a man in the middle of the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had no doubt that it was the messenger from albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went up to him , but , to his extreme astonishment , the stranger first addressed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what wants your excellency of me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the man , retreating a step or two , as if to keep on his guard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are not you the person who brought me a letter , inquired franz ,  - from the viscount of morcerf? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency s name<s> <s>  - is the baron franz d pinay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired franz , taking the letter from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yesyour friend at least hopes so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come upstairs with me , and i will give it to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i prefer waiting here , said the messenger , with a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall i find you here , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz entered the hotel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the landlord . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> responded franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i have seen him , he replied ,  - and he has handed this letter to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed , and this had only made him the more anxious to read albert s letter; and so he went instantly towards the waxlight , and unfolded it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was written and signed by albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was thus worded: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> run to torlonia , draw from him instantly four thousand piastres , and give them to the bearer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is urgent that i should have this money without delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your friend ,<s> <s>  - albert de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>i now believe in italian banditti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani , alla sette il conte alberto avr cessato di vivere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - luigi vampa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands , by seven o clock the count albert will have ceased to live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no time to lose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he hastened to open the secrtaire , and found the pocket - book in the drawer , and in it the letter of credit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to franz , he had no letter of credit , as he lived at florence , and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight days; he had brought but a hundred louis , and of these he had not more than fifty left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> true , he might in such a case rely on the kindness of signor torlonia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was , therefore , about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time , when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remembered the count of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz was about to ring for signor pastrini , when that worthy presented himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , your excellency; he has this moment returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then ring at his door , if you please , and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> signor pastrini did as he was desired , and returning five minutes after , he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count awaits your excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz went along the corridor , and a servant introduced him to the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen , and which was surrounded with divans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count came towards him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , what good wind blows you hither at this hour? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he;  - have you come to sup with me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are we alone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the count , going to the door , and returning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz gave him albert s letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - read that , he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you see the postscript? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani , alla sette il conte alberto avr cessato di vivere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - luigi vampa . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - what think you of that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count went to his secrtaire , opened it , and pulling out a drawer filled with gold , said to franz ,  - i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see , on the contrary , i come to you first and instantly , replied franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i thank you; have what you will; and he made a sign to franz to take what he pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it absolutely necessary , then , to send the money to luigi vampa? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the young man , looking fixedly in his turn at the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - judge for yourself , replied he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the postscript is explicit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting , you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation , said franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if we were to go together to luigi vampa , i am sure he would not refuse you albert s freedom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you not saved peppino s life? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well , said the count ,  - who told you that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no matter; i know it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count knit his brows , and remained silent an instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and if i went to seek vampa , would you accompany me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if my society would not be disagreeable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be it so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall i take any arms? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - any money? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is useless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will summon him hither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to your apartments , perhaps; but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street , and whistled in a peculiar manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man in the mantle quitted the wall , and advanced into the middle of the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count , in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation , but rather with alacrity , and , mounting the steps at a bound , entered the hotel; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , it is you , peppino , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said the count ,  - you have , then , not forgotten that i saved your life; that is strange , for it is a week ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , excellency; and never shall i forget it , returned peppino , with an accent of profound gratitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is a long time; but it is something that you believe so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rise and answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you may speak before his excellency , said he;  - he is one of my friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you allow me to give you this title? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continued the count in french ,  - it is necessary to excite this man s confidence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you can speak before me , said franz;  - i am a friend of the count s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how did the viscount albert fall into luigi s hands? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the chief s mistress? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the frenchman threw her a bouquet; teresa returned itall this with the consent of the chief , who was in the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried franz ,  - was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was he who drove , disguised as the coachman , replied peppino . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , the frenchman took off his mask; teresa , with the chief s consent , did the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the frenchman asked for a rendezvous; teresa gave him oneonly , instead of teresa , it was beppo who was on the steps of the church of san giacomo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived; beppo has taken in plenty of others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exactly so; a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beppo got in , inviting the frenchman to follow him , and he did not wait to be asked twice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo; and when they were two hundred yards outside , as the frenchman became somewhat too forward , beppo put a brace of pistols to his head , the coachman pulled up and did the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time , four of the band , who were concealed on the banks of the almo , surrounded the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the frenchman made some resistance , and nearly strangled beppo; but he could not resist five armed men , and was forced to yield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they made him get out , walk along the banks of the river , and then brought him to teresa and luigi , who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sebastian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do you say to it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , that i should think it very amusing , replied franz ,  - if it had happened to anyone but poor albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and , in truth , if you had not found me here , said the count ,  - it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear; but now , be assured , his alarm will be the only serious consequence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and shall we go and find him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , decidedly , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was never in them; but i have often resolved to visit them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , here is an opportunity made to your hand , and it would be difficult to contrive a better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is of no consequence; i always have one ready , day and night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - always ready? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count rang , and a footman appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - order out the carriage , he said ,  - and remove the pistols which are in the holsters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a very short time the noise of wheels was heard , and the carriage stopped at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count took out his watch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you still resolved to accompany me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - more determined than ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , come along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and the count went downstairs , accompanied by peppino . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the door they found the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali was on the box , in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and the count got into the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino placed himself beside ali , and they set off at a rapid pace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sebastian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the porter raised some difficulties , but the count of monte cristo produced a permit from the governor of rome , allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night; the portcullis was therefore raised , the porter had a louis for his trouble , and they went on their way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient appian way , and bordered with tombs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from time to time , by the light of the moon , which began to rise , franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins , and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped , peppino opened the door , and the count and franz alighted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in ten minutes , said the count to his companion ,  - we shall be there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then took peppino aside , gave him an order in a low voice , and peppino went away , taking with him a torch , brought with them in the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said the count ,  - let us follow him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ought we to go on? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked franz of the count;  - or should we pause? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the two men was peppino , and the other a bandit on the lookout . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and the count advanced , and the bandit saluted them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency , said peppino , addressing the count ,  - if you will follow me , the opening of the catacombs is close at hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks , by which a man could scarcely pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino glided first into this crevice; after they got along a few paces the passage widened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino passed , lighted his torch , and turned to see if they came after him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the passageway sloped in a gentle descent , enlarging as they proceeded; still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture , and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way , and then were stopped by ,  - who comes there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a friend! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> responded peppino; and , advancing alone towards the sentry , he said a few words to him in a low tone; and then he , like the first , saluted the nocturnal visitors , making a sign that they might proceed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and the count descended these , and found themselves in a mortuary chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he inquired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come with me , then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino , put out the torch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino obeyed , and franz and the count were in utter darkness , except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare , more evident since peppino had put out his torch , was visible along the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three arcades were before them , and the middle one was used as a door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the midst of this chamber were four stones , which had formerly served as an altar , as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column , and was reading with his back turned to the arcades , through the openings of which the new - comers contemplated him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> around him , and in groups , according to their fancy , lying in their mantles , or with their backs against a sort of stone bench , which went all round the columbarium , were to be seen twenty brigands or more , each having his carbine within reach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the other end , silent , scarcely visible , and like a shadow , was a sentinel , who was walking up and down before a grotto , which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau , he raised his finger to his lips , to warn him to be silent , and , ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium , entered the chamber by the middle arcade , and advanced towards vampa , who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who comes there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the sentinel , who was less abstracted , and who saw by the lamp - light a shadow approaching his chief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this challenge , vampa rose quickly , drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems that your memory is equally short in everything , vampa , said the count ,  - and that not only do you forget people s faces , but also the conditions you make with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what conditions have i forgotten , your excellency? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the bandit , with the air of a man who , having committed an error , is anxious to repair it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the viscount albert de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why did you not tell me all thisyou? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count , who has all our lives in his hands? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency , i would blow his brains out with my own hand! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you not alone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed , and to whom i desired to prove that luigi vampa was a man of his word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz approached , the chief advancing several steps to meet him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - welcome among us , your excellency , he said to him;  - you heard what the count just said , and also my reply; let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your friend s ransom , that this had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing has happened to him , i hope , said the count frowningly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the prisoner is there , replied vampa , pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard ,  - and i will go myself and tell him he is free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as albert s prison , and franz and the count followed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired vampa of the sentinel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi , captain , replied the sentry ,  - i do not know; for the last hour i have not heard him stir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come in , your excellency , said vampa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count and franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief , who drew back a bolt and opened a door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , by the gleam of a lamp , similar to that which lighted the columbarium , albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him , lying in a corner in profound slumber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said the count , smiling with his own peculiar smile ,  - not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven o clock tomorrow morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vampa looked at albert with a kind of admiration; he was not insensible to such a proof of courage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are right , your excellency , he said;  - this must be one of your friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then going to albert , he touched him on the shoulder , saying ,  - will your excellency please to awaken? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said he ,  - is it you , captain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you should have allowed me to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had such a delightful dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he drew his watch from his pocket , that he might see how time sped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to tell you that you are free , your excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , then , they have paid my ransom? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , your excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , how am i free? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come hither? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then that person is a most amiable person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert looked around and perceived franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , said he ,  - is it you , my dear franz , whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , not i , replied franz ,  - but our neighbor , the count of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my dear count , said albert gayly , arranging his cravat and wristbands ,  - you are really most kind , and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you , in the first place for the carriage , and in the next for this visit , and he put out his hand to the count , who shuddered as he gave his own , but who nevertheless did give it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement; he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him , and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered; as for franz , he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear albert , he said ,  - if you will make haste , we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonia s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are decidedly right , and we may reach the palazzo by two o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> signor luigi , continued albert ,  - is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - peppino , said the brigand chief ,  - give me the torch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will show you the way back myself , said the captain;  - that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman , he preceded his guests , not as a servant who performs an act of civility , but like a king who precedes ambassadors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on reaching the door , he bowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now , your excellency , added he ,  - allow me to repeat my apologies , and i hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , my dear vampa , replied the count;  - besides , you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way , that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentlemen , added the chief , turning towards the young men ,  - perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you; but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit , wherever i may be , you shall be welcome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and albert bowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz paused for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - has your excellency anything to ask me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said vampa with a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - csar s commentaries , said the bandit ,  - it is my favorite work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , are you coming? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , your pardon , said albert , turning round;  - will you allow me , captain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he lighted his cigar at vampa s torch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am enormously anxious to finish my night at the duke of bracciano s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they found the carriage where they had left it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count said a word in arabic to ali , and the horses went on at great speed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame , said the viscount of morcerf , advancing towards the countess ,  - yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop; i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise , but here is my friend , whose character for veracity you well know , and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been , in some sort , forced to give his hand to albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first words that albert uttered to his friend , on the following morning , contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit to the count; true , the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz , who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count , in which terror was strangely mingled , felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him , and therefore made no objection to albert s request , but at once accompanied him to the desired spot , and , after a short delay , the count joined them in the salon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear count , said albert , advancing to meet him ,  - permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night , and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory; believe me , as long as i live , i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me; and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my very good friend and excellent neighbor , replied the count , with a smile ,  - you really exaggerate my trifling exertions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , said albert ,  - i deserve no credit for what i could not help , namely , a determination to take everything as i found it , and to let those bandits see , that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world , there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that , however , has nothing to do with my obligations to you , and i now come to ask you whether , in my own person , my family , or connections , i can in any way serve you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father , the comte de morcerf , although of spanish origin , possesses considerable influence , both at the court of france and madrid , and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself , and all to whom my life is dear , at your disposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur de morcerf , replied the count ,  - your offer , far from surprising me , is precisely what i expected from you , and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;nay , i will go still further , and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , pray name it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can scarcely credit it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so distinguished an individual as yourself , cried albert ,  - could scarcely have required an introduction . </s> </s>

<s> <s> de morcerf ( these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile ) ,  - whether you undertake , upon my arrival in france , to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin - china? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , that i do , and with infinite pleasure , answered albert;  - and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris , in consequence of a treaty of marriage ( my dear franz , do not smile , i beg of you ) with a family of high standing , and connected with the very cream of parisian society . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - connected by marriage , you mean , said franz , laughingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , never mind how it is , answered albert ,  - it comes to the same thing in the end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps by the time you return to paris , i shall be quite a sober , staid father of a family! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a most edifying representative i shall make of all the domestic virtuesdon t you think so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then it is settled , said the count ,  - and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo , and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely , hoping to read something of his purpose in his face , but his countenance was inscrutable especially when , as in the present case , it was veiled in a sphinx - like smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but tell me now , count , exclaimed albert , delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo;  - tell me truly whether you are in earnest , or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives , but which , like a house built on the sand , is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i pledge you my honor , returned the count ,  - that i mean to do as i have said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - day for day , hour for hour , said albert;  - that will suit me to a dot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so be it , then , replied the count , and extending his hand towards a calendar , suspended near the chimney - piece , he said ,  - today is the 21st of february; and drawing out his watch , added ,  - it is exactly half - past ten o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now promise me to remember this , and expect me the 21st of may at the same hour in the forenoon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - capital! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where do you live? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i reside in my father s house , but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard , entirely separated from the main building . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - quite sufficient , replied the count , as , taking out his tablets , he wrote down  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 27 , rue du helder , 21st may , half - past ten in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall i see you again ere my departure? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that depends; when do you leave? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in that case i must say adieu to you , as i am compelled to go to naples , and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for france? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i fear i shall not have that honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , since we must part , said the count , holding out a hand to each of the young men ,  - allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him , and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch , for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the 21st of may , at half - past ten in the morning , rue du helder , no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 27 , replied the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young men then rose , and bowing to the count , quitted the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear fellow , exclaimed albert ,  - what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , you must have lost your senses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you anything particular against him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - possibly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you ever meet him previously to coming hither? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and where? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what i am about to tell you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i promise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon your honor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then listen to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there , and the two corsican bandits with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count , and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he recounted , with circumstantial exactitude , all the particulars of the supper , the hashish , the statues , the dream , and how , at his awakening , there remained no proof or trace of all these events , save the small yacht , seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto - vecchio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum , between the count and vampa , in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino ,an engagement which , as our readers are aware , he most faithfully fulfilled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night , and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required , and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert listened with the most profound attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said he , when franz had concluded ,  - what do you find to object to in all you have related? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count is fond of travelling , and , being rich , possesses a vessel of his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go but to portsmouth or southampton , and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the english as can afford the expense , and have the same liking for this amusement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , by way of having a resting - place during his excursions , avoiding the wretched cookerywhich has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months , while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years ,and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber , monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him; but , to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace , and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital , he has wisely enough purchased the island , and taken its name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just ask yourself , my good fellow , whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said franz ,  - the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , really the thing seems to me simple enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves , but purely and simply fugitives , driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village , and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma; for my own part , i protest that , should i ever go to corsica , my first visit , ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect , should be to the bandits of colomba , if i could only manage to find them; for , on my conscience , they are a race of men i admire greatly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - still , persisted franz ,  - i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains , who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - talking of countries , replied franz ,  - of what country is the count , what is his native tongue , whence does he derive his immense fortune , and what were those events of his early lifea life as marvellous as unknownthat have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  was not that nearly what you said? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , did he ask you , who is m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how does he come by his namehis fortune? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are his means of existence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is his birthplace? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of what country is he a native?   tell me , did he put all these questions to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i confess he asked me none . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , in spite of all , you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is a philanthropist , answered the other;  - and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize , given , as you are aware , to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now , my dear franz , let us talk of something else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , shall we take our luncheon , and then pay a last visit to st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peter s? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz silently assented; and the following afternoon , at half - past five o clock , the young men parted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , ere he entered his travelling carriage , albert , fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into , placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo , on which , beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf , he had written in pencil: </s> </s>

m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert de morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court , and directly opposite another building , in which were the servants  apartments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> between the court and the garden , built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture , was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a small door , close to the lodge of the concierge , gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother , unwilling to part from her son , and yet aware that a young man of the viscount s age required the full exercise of his liberty , had chosen this habitation for albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were not lacking , however , evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent , careless life of an only son , and who lives as it were in a gilded cage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by means of the two windows looking into the street , albert could see all that passed; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men , who always want to see the world traverse their horizon , even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , should anything appear to merit a more minute examination , albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate , similar to that close to the concierge s door , and which merits a particular description . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built , so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but the well - oiled hinges and locks told quite another story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this door was a mockery to the concierge , from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free , and , like that famous portal in the arabian nights , opening at the  - sesame of ali baba , it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of a long corridor , with which the door communicated , and which formed the antechamber , was , on the right , albert s breakfast - room , looking into the court , and on the left the salon , looking into the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows , and hid from the garden and court these two apartments , the only rooms into which , as they were on the ground floor , the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the floor above were similar rooms , with the addition of a third , formed out of the antechamber; these three rooms were a salon , a boudoir , and a bedroom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> above this floor was a large atelier , which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitionsa pandemonium , in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre - eminence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were collected and piled up all albert s successive caprices , hunting - horns , bass - viols , flutesa whole orchestra , for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music; easels , palettes , brushes , pencilsfor music had been succeeded by painting; foils , boxing - gloves , broadswords , and single - sticksfor , following the example of the fashionable young men of the time , albert de morcerf cultivated , with far more perseverance than music and drawing , the three arts that complete a dandy s education , i . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this was albert s favorite lounging place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert glanced carelessly at the different missives , selected two written in a small and delicate hand , and enclosed in scented envelopes , opened them and perused their contents with some attention . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets , mine is incomplete; and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three o clock , and that i request permission to introduce someone to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert threw himself on the divan , tore off the cover of two or three of the papers , looked at the theatre announcements , made a face seeing they gave an opera , and not a ballet; hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth - powder of which he had heard , and threw down , one after the other , the three leading papers of paris , muttering ,<s> <s>  - these papers become more and more stupid every day . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - well , since we are not to sit down to table , said debray ,  - take a glass of sherry , and tell us all about it . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , and for a most curious one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we know that , said beauchamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there are no bandits , cried debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes there are , and most hideous , or rather most admirable ones , for i found them ugly enough to frighten me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , my dear albert , said debray ,  - confess that your cook is behindhand , that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or marennes , and that , like madame de maintenon , you are going to replace the dish by a story . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - just so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , his name is the count of monte cristo . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he comes possibly from the holy land , and one of his ancestors possessed calvary , as the mortemarts did the dead sea . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - well , he of whom i speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand , of this atom; he has purchased the title of count somewhere in tuscany . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is rich , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i believe so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but that ought to be visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is what deceives you , debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not understand you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you read the arabian nights? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a question! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor , if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which means? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has even a name taken from the book , since he calls himself sinbad the sailor , and has a cave filled with gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you have seen this cavern , morcerf? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked beauchamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , but franz has; for heaven s sake , not a word of this before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz went in with his eyes blindfolded , and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two young men looked at morcerf as if to say , - are you mad , or are you laughing at us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i also , said morrel thoughtfully ,  - have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , cried albert ,  - it is very lucky that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel comes to aid me; you are vexed , are you not , that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who travel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will send you to constantinople . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you say very true , responded debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said albert ,  - but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pardieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone exists . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doubtless , but not in the same way; everyone has not black slaves , a princely retinue , an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress , horses that cost six thousand francs apiece , and greek mistresses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you seen the greek mistress? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw her at the theatre , and heard her one morning when i breakfasted with the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he eats , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he must be a vampire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for a man not connected with newspapers , here is the pendant to the famous sea - serpent of the constitutionnel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just so , lucien , returned morcerf;  - you have described him feature for feature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , keen and cutting politeness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man has often made me shudder; and one day when we were viewing an execution , i thought i should faint , more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture , than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - or , having delivered you , make you sign a flaming parchment , surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth - right? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when i look at you parisians , idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne , and think of this man , it seems to me we are not of the same race . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am highly flattered , returned beauchamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at the same time , added chteau - renaud ,  - your count of monte cristo is a very fine fellow , always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there are no italian banditti , said debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is half - past ten striking , albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - confess you have dreamed this , and let us sit down to breakfast , continued beauchamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced ,  - his excellency the count of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerf s narrative had impressed them , and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not heard a carriage stop in the street , or steps in the antechamber; the door had itself opened noiselessly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every article of dresshat , coat , gloves , and bootswas from the first makers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count advanced , smiling , into the centre of the room , and approached albert , who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - punctuality , said monte cristo ,  - is the politeness of kings , according to one of your sovereigns , i think; but it is not the same with travellers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear count , replied albert ,  - i was announcing your visit to some of my friends , whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make , and whom i now present to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are the count of chteau - renaud , whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers , and whose ancestors had a place at the round table; m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lucien debray , private secretary to the minister of the interior; m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp , an editor of a paper , and the terror of the french government , but of whom , in spite of his national celebrity , you perhaps have not heard in italy , since his paper is prohibited there; and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this name the count , who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy , but at the same time with coldness and formality , stepped a pace forward , and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors , monsieur , said he;  - it is a handsome uniform . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one could have said what caused the count s voice to vibrate so deeply , and what made his eye flash , which was in general so clear , lustrous , and limpid when he pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf , interrupted morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me go on , captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and we have just heard , continued albert ,  - of a new deed of his , and so heroic a one , that , although i have seen him today for the first time , i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look , changing color , and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , you have a noble heart , said the count;  - so much the better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this exclamation , which corresponded to the count s own thought rather than to what albert was saying , surprised everybody , and especially morrel , who looked at monte cristo with wonder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , at the same time , the intonation was so soft that , however strange the speech might seem , it was impossible to be offended at it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what say you , morrel! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi , he has an open look about him that pleases me , in spite of the singular remark he has made about me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentlemen , said albert ,  - germain informs me that breakfast is ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear count , allow me to show you the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they passed silently into the breakfast - room , and everyone took his place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am a stranger , and a stranger to such a degree , that this is the first time i have ever been at paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the french way of living is utterly unknown to me , and up to the present time i have followed the eastern customs , which are entirely in contrast to the parisian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i beg you , therefore , to excuse if you find anything in me too turkish , too italian , or too arabian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with what an air he says all this , muttered beauchamp;  - decidedly he is a great man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a great man in his own country , added debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a great man in every country , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , said chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert remarked this , expressing his fears lest , at the outset , the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear count , said he ,  - i fear one thing , and that is , that the fare of the rue du helder is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di spagna . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ought to have consulted you on the point , and have had some dishes prepared expressly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you know me better , returned the count , smiling ,  - you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself , who has successively lived on macaroni at naples , polenta at milan , olla podrida at valencia , pilau at constantinople , curry in india , and swallows  nests in china . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i eat everywhere , and of everything , only i eat but little; and today , that you reproach me with my want of appetite , is my day of appetite , for i have not eaten since yesterday morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , cried all the guests ,  - you have not eaten for four - and - twenty hours? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you ate in your carriage? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i slept , as i generally do when i am weary without having the courage to amuse myself , or when i am hungry without feeling inclined to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you can sleep when you please , monsieur? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have a recipe for it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an infallible one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that would be invaluable to us in africa , who have not always any food to eat , and rarely anything to drink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , returned monte cristo;  - i make no secret of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a mixture of excellent opium , which i fetched myself from canton in order to have it pure , and the best hashish which grows in the eastthat is , between the tigris and the euphrates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ten minutes after one is taken , the effect is produced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ask baron franz d pinay; i think he tasted them one day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied morcerf ,  - he said something about it to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - always . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continued beauchamp , hoping to take him at a disadvantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , monsieur , returned the count; and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket , formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were four or five more in the emerald , which would contain about a dozen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and is it your cook who prepares these pills? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked beauchamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , monsieur , replied monte cristo;  - i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is a magnificent emerald , and the largest i have ever seen , said chteau - renaud ,  - although my mother has some remarkable family jewels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i had three similar ones , returned monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the sultan , the liberty of a woman , replied the count;  - the pope , the life of a man; so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and it was peppino you saved , was it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried morcerf;  - it was for him that you obtained pardon? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps , returned the count , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear count , you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus , said morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the arabian nights , a wizard of the middle ages; but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths , when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for example , here is debray who reads , and beauchamp who prints , every day , a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard;  four persons have been assassinated in the rue st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> denis  or the faubourg st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> germain;  ten , fifteen , or twenty thieves , have been arrested in a caf on the boulevard du temple , or in the thermes de julien , and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma , the campagna di romana , or the pontine marshes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sebastian , instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the rue du helder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said monte cristo  - you promised me never to mention that circumstance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was not i who made that promise , cried morcerf;  - it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner , and whom you have forgotten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems to me , returned the count , smiling ,  - that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , you promise me , if i tell all i know , to relate , in your turn , all that i do not know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is but fair , replied monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sebastian , where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing csar s commentaries , and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me , that unless the next morning , before six o clock , four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker s , at a quarter past six i should have ceased to exist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the letter is still to be seen , for it is in franz d pinay s possession , signed by me , and with a postscript of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is all i know , but i know not , count , how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i assure you , franz and i were lost in admiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing more simple , returned the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i had known the famous vampa for more than ten years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in after years , whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents , which ought to have cemented our friendship , or whether he did not recollect me , he sought to take me , but , on the contrary , it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see they kept their promise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , monsieur , returned monte cristo  - upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you , who are socialists , and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor , but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me , and which i will even say , generally occupies itself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem , and preserving a neutrality towards them , it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bravo , count , bravo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is frank , at least , said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de chteau - renaud , leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when albert found himself alone with monte cristo ,  - my dear count , said he ,  - allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you a specimen of a bachelor s apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as we pass from one room to another , i will open the windows to let you breathe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo had already seen the breakfast - room and the salon on the ground floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert led him first to his atelier , which was , as we have said , his favorite apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo quickly appreciated all that albert had collected hereold cabinets , japanese porcelain , oriental stuffs , venetian glass , arms from all parts of the worldeverything was familiar to him; and at the first glance he recognized their date , their country , and their origin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this portrait attracted the count of monte cristo s attention , for he made three rapid steps in the chamber , and stopped suddenly before it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six - and - twenty , with a dark complexion , and light and lustrous eyes , veiled beneath long lashes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen , a red and black bodice , and golden pins in her hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count s visage , or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have there a most charming mistress , viscount , said the count in a perfectly calm tone;  - and this costumea ball costume , doubtlessbecomes her admirably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , monsieur , returned albert ,  - i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you do not know my mother; she it is whom you see here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this costume is a fancy one , it appears , and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my mother the same as she was in 1830 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise; but , strange to say , this portrait seemed to displease my father , and the value of the picture , which is , as you see , one of the best works of lopold robert , could not overcome his dislike to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true , between ourselves , that m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess , who are still as much united , although married more than twenty years , as on the first day of their wedding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert , as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words , but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> consider yourself as in your own house , and to put yourself still more at your ease , pray accompany me to the apartments of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf , he whom i wrote from rome an account of the services you rendered me , and to whom i announced your promised visit , and i may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are somewhat blas i know , and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor , who has seen so many others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian lifea life of politeness , visiting , and introductions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo bowed without making any answer; he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret , as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert summoned his servant , and ordered him to acquaint m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - azure seven merlets , or , placed bender , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - these are , doubtless , your family arms? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stephen , and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , you must have something on the panels of your carriage , to escape being searched by the custom - house officers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> excuse my putting such a question to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not indiscreet , returned morcerf , with the simplicity of conviction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have guessed rightly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these are our arms , that is , those of my father , but they are , as you see , joined to another shield , which has gules , a silver tower , which are my mother s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by her side i am spanish , but the family of morcerf is french , and , i have heard , one of the oldest of the south of france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied monte cristo  - these blazons prove that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arms either a cross , in honor of their mission , or birds of passage , in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake , and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of your ancestors had joined the crusades , and supposing it to be only that of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is possible , said morcerf;  - my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that , and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified d hozier and jaucourt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at present i no longer think of it , and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that i have noticed on your monuments , and which have no heraldic meaning whatever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , you are at once from provence and spain; that explains , if the portrait you showed me be like , the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would have required the penetration of dipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words , apparently uttered with the greatest politeness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morcerf thanked him with a smile , and pushed open the door above which were his arms , and which , as we have said , opened into the salon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was that of a man , from five to eight - and - thirty , in the uniform of a general officer , wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion , that indicates superior rank , the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck , which showed he was a commander , and on the right breast , the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour , and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain , or , what was just the same thing as regarded decorations , had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a man of forty to forty - five years , but he seemed at least fifty , and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair , which was cut short , in the military fashion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was dressed in plain clothes , and wore at his button - hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he entered with a tolerably dignified step , and some little haste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground , and his eyes on the count of morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father , said the young man ,  - i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo , the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are most welcome , monsieur , said the count of morcerf , saluting monte cristo with a smile ,  - and monsieur has rendered our house , in preserving its only heir , a service which insures him our eternal gratitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he said these words , the count of morcerf pointed to a chair , while he seated himself in another opposite the window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo , in taking the seat morcerf offered him , placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains , and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the countess , said morcerf ,  - was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a great honor to me , returned monte cristo ,  - to be thus , on the first day of my arrival in paris , brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation , and to whom fortune has for once been equitable , but has she not still on the plains of mitidja , or in the mountains of atlas , a marshal s staff to offer you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , replied morcerf , reddening slightly ,  - i have left the service , monsieur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> made a peer at the restoration , i served through the first campaign under the orders of marshal bourmont . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have hung up my sword , and cast myself into politics . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have devoted myself to industry; i study the useful arts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the twenty years i served , i often wished to do so , but i had not the time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a gentleman of high birth , possessor of an ample fortune , you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier , step by stepthis is uncommon; then become general , peer of france , commander of the legion of honor , you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship , without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow - creatures; this , indeed , is praiseworthy ,nay , more , it is sublime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert looked on and listened with astonishment; he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , continued the stranger , doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerf s brow ,  - we do not act thus in italy; we grow according to our race and our species , and we pursue the same lines , and often the same uselessness , all our lives . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she treats her children ill , but she always welcomes strangers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , father , said albert with a smile ,  - it is evident you do not know the count of monte cristo; he despises all honors , and contents himself with those written on his passport . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is the most just remark , replied the stranger ,  - i ever heard made concerning myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have been free to choose your career , observed the count of morcerf , with a sigh;  - and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - precisely , monsieur , replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i did not fear to fatigue you , said the general , evidently charmed with the count s manners ,  - i would have taken you to the chamber; there is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern senators . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall be most grateful , monsieur , if you will , at some future time , renew your offer , but i have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess , and i will therefore wait . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , here is my mother , cried the viscount . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo , turned round hastily , and saw madame de morcerf at the entrance of the salon , at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered , pale and motionless; when monte cristo turned round , she let fall her arm , which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded door - post . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had been there some moments , and had heard the last words of the visitor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter rose and bowed to the countess , who inclined herself without speaking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you ill , mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the viscount , springing towards her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monsieur , continued the countess , advancing with the majesty of a queen ,  - i owe to you the life of my son , and for this i bless you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , i thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you , from the bottom of my heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame , said he ,  - the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to save a man , to spare a father s feelings , or a mother s sensibility , is not to do a good action , but a simple deed of humanity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at these words , uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness , madame de morcerf replied: </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - believe me , madame , i feel most grateful for your kindness , but i got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning , and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris , which i scarcely know; this is but a trifling inquietude , i know , but one that may be appreciated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we shall have the pleasure another time , said the countess;  - you promise that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo inclined himself without answering , but the gesture might pass for assent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear count , said albert ,  - i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome , and place my coup at your disposal until your own be ready . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as soon as he appeared in the count of morcerf s antechamber , a footman , the same who at rome had brought the count s card to the two young men , and announced his visit , sprang into the vestibule , and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a coup of koller s building , and with horses and harness for which drake had , to the knowledge of all the lions of paris , refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur , said the count to albert ,  - i do not ask you to accompany me to my house , as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry , and i have , as you know , a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give me , therefore , one more day before i invite you; i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you ask me for a day , count , i know what to anticipate; it will not be a house i shall see , but a palace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke , he sprang into the vehicle , the door was closed , but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert could not see the face of the countess , as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head , and which fell over her features in misty folds , but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear mother , have you been ill during my absence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , albert , but you know these roses , tuberoses , and orange - flowers throw out at first , before one is used to them , such violent perfumes . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , i do remember , replied the countess . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing - room , said the viscount;  - they make the countess ill . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - what is this name of monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the countess , when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers ,  - is it a family name , or the name of the estate , or a simple title? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i do not ask you of his origin but what he is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you say<s> <s>  - i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean , without inhabitants or garrison , the resort of smugglers of all nations , and pirates of every flag . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is possible , said the countess , reflecting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never mind , continued the young man ,  - smuggler or not , you must agree , mother dear , as you have seen him , that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man , who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris . </s> </s>

<s> <s> inquired mercds , evidently attaching great importance to this question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is the truth , however . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three or four times he has said to me , and certainly without the slightest premeditation , at such a period i was five years old , at another ten years old , at another twelve ,  and i , induced by curiosity , which kept me alive to these details , have compared the dates , and never found him inaccurate . </s> </s>

<s> <s> each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father , added albert with a laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , after seeing her eyes closed , and hearing her breathe gently , he believed she had dropped asleep , and left the apartment on tiptoe , closing the door after him with the utmost precaution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - most decidedly , said he ,  - men are not equal , and i must beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the count had arrived at his house; it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance , but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves , to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20 ,000 francs apiece for his horses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the house ali had chosen , and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo , was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs - lyses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre , and masked a portion of the front; around this shrubbery two alleys , like two arms , extended right and left , and formed a carriage - drive from the iron gates to a double portico , on every step of which stood a porcelain vase , filled with flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even before the coachman had hailed the concierge , the massy gates rolled on their hingesthey had seen the count coming , and at paris , as everywhere else , he was served with the rapidity of lightning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the coachman entered and traversed the half - circle without slackening his speed , and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other bowed respectfully , and offered his arm to assist the count in descending . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thanks , m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as the steward had said , the notary awaited him in the small salon . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well; and where is this house that i purchase? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the count carelessly , addressing himself half to bertuccio , half to the notary . </s> </s>

<s> <s> said the count;  - but that is not in the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what made you choose a house at the gates of paris , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i , cried the steward with a strange expression . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if his excellency will recollectif he will think<s> <s>  - ah , true , observed monte cristo;  - i recollect now . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - oh , no , returned monte cristo negligently;  - since i have this , i will keep it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you are quite right , said the notary , who feared to lose his fee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a charming place , well supplied with spring - water and fine trees; a comfortable habitation , although abandoned for a long time , without reckoning the furniture , which , although old , is yet valuable , now that old things are so much sought after . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i suppose the count has the tastes of the day? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to be sure , returned monte cristo;  - it is very convenient , then? </s> </s>

<s> <s> the steward left the room with a faltering step , and returned with a bundle of bank - notes , which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - all , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you the keys? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they are in the hands of the concierge , who takes care of the house , but here is the order i have given him to install the count in his new possessions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well; and monte cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary , which said ,  - i have no further need of you; you may go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , observed the honest notary ,  - the count is , i think , mistaken; it is only fifty thousand francs , everything included . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and your fee? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is included in this sum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but have you not come from auteuil here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , certainly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble , said the count; and he made a gesture of polite dismissal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the notary left the room backwards , and bowing down to the ground; it was the first time he had ever met a similar client . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - see this gentleman out , said the count to bertuccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the steward followed the notary out of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely was the count alone , when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock , and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck , and which never left him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after having sought for a few minutes , he stopped at a leaf which had several notes , and compared them with the deed of sale , which lay on the table , and recalling his souvenirs<s> <s>  - auteuil , rue de la fontaine , no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , in an hour i shall know all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the steward appeared at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur bertuccio , said the count ,  - did you never tell me that you had travelled in france? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , excellency , no , returned the steward , with a sort of nervous trembling , which monte cristo , a connoisseur in all emotions , rightly attributed to great disquietude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to auteuil! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried bertuccio , whose copper complexion became livid - i go to auteuil? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , what is there surprising in that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monte cristo , in the same tone that louis xiv . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pronounced the famous ,  - i have been almost obliged to wait . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber , and cried in a hoarse voice: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his excellency s horses! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo wrote two or three notes , and , as he sealed the last , the steward appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , take your hat and gloves , returned monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - am i to accompany you , your excellency? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried bertuccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , you must give the orders , for i intend residing at the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo noticed , as they descended the staircase , that bertuccio signed himself in the corsican manner; that is , had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb , and as he seated himself in the carriage , muttered a short prayer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward s extraordinary repugnance for the count s projected drive without the walls; but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little journey . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine , no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 28 , said the count , fixing his eyes on the steward , to whom he gave this order . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio s forehead was covered with perspiration; however , he obeyed , and , leaning out of the window , he cried to the coachman , - rue de la fontaine , no . </s> </s>

<s> <s> no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the count ,  - you do not get out , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio sprang out , and offered his shoulder to the count , who , this time , leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio knocked , the door opened , and the concierge appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he held out to the concierge the notary s order . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the house is sold , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the marquis of saint - mran . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the marquis of saint - mran! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> returned the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he appeared to meditate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , who had been the king s attorney at nmes , and afterwards at versailles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo glanced at bertuccio , who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and is not this daughter dead? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded monte cristo;  - i fancy i have heard so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , monsieur , one - and - twenty years ago; and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give me a light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , it is unnecessary; bertuccio will show me a light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces , which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the steward obeyed in silence , but it was easy to see , from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled , how much it cost him to obey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they went over a tolerably large ground floor; a first floor consisted of a salon , a bathroom , and two bedrooms; near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> light me , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio , and go first; we will see where it leads to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur , replied bertuccio ,  - it leads to the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and , pray , how do you know that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it ought to do so , at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the outer door the steward paused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on , monsieur bertuccio , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he who was addressed stood there , stupefied , bewildered , stunned; his haggard eyes glanced around , as if in search of the traces of some terrible event , and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> insisted the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , cried bertuccio , setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , monsieur , it is impossible; i can go no farther . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what does this mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded the irresistible voice of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , why did i not tell you all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sure you would not have forced me to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hoped your house would have been some other one than this; as if there was not another house at auteuil than that of the assassination! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried monte cristo , stopping suddenly ,  - what words do you utter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> devil of a man , corsican that you arealways mysteries or superstitions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , take the lantern , and let us visit the garden; you are not afraid of ghosts with me , i hope? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio raised the lantern , and obeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door , as it opened , disclosed a gloomy sky , in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant , only to sink into obscurity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the steward wished to turn to the left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , monsieur , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here is a beautiful lawn; let us go on straight forwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow , but obeyed; however , he continued to take the left hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo , on the contrary , took the right hand; arrived near a clump of trees , he stopped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the steward could not restrain himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where he fell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear monsieur bertuccio , said monte cristo , laughing ,  - control yourself; we are not at sartne or at corte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is not a corsican maquis but an english garden; badly kept , i own , but still you must not calumniate it for that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur , i implore you do not stay there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think you are going mad , bertuccio , said the count coldly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> excellency , returned bertuccio , joining his hands , and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the count s laughter , had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him , and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio clasped his hands , and as , in all these evolutions , he did not let fall the lantern , the light showed his pale and altered countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , i shall write to the abb; i shall hold him responsible for his protg s misconduct , and i shall soon know all about this assassination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , do not do that , excellency; i have always served you faithfully , cried bertuccio , in despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have always been an honest man , and , as far as lay in my power , i have done good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a bad sign; a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks , and such fever in the hands of a man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but as he said you would make an excellent steward , i concluded you had stolenthat was all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , your excellency! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> returned bertuccio in deep contempt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - or , as you are a corsican , that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff ,  as you call it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , my good master , cried bertuccio , casting himself at the count s feet ,  - it was simply vengeancenothing else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , monsieur , it is very natural , returned bertuccio ,  - since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whose , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the marquis de saint - mran , i think , the concierge said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what had you to revenge on the marquis de saint - mran? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , it was not on him , monsieur; it was on another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is strange , returned monte cristo , seeming to yield to his reflections ,  - that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first , you purchase a house at auteuilthis house is the one where i have committed an assassination; you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended; you stop at the spot where he received the blow; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is not chance , for chance , in this case , is too much like providence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , amiable corsican , let us suppose it is providence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i always suppose anything people please , and , besides , you must concede something to diseased minds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , collect yourself , and tell me all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have related it but once , and that was to the abb busoni . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such things , continued bertuccio , shaking his head ,  - are only related under the seal of confession . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said the count ,  - i refer you to your confessor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> turn chartreux or trappist , and relate your secrets , but , as for me , i do not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms , and i do not choose that my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - ah , really , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you proof of this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i had it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you have lost it; how stupid! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but by careful search it might be recovered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio remained standing before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at what point shall i begin my story , your excellency? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked bertuccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where you please , returned monte cristo ,  - since i know nothing at all of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - some particulars , doubtless , but that is seven or eight years ago , and i have forgotten them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i can speak without fear of tiring your excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio; you will supply the want of the evening papers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said monte cristo ,  - 1815 is not yesterday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , monsieur , and yet i recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had a brother , an elder brother , who was in the service of the emperor; he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of corsicans . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - excuse me , excellency , but these details are necessary , and you promised to be patient . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on; i will keep my word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one day we received a letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this letter was from my brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he told us that the army was disbanded , and that he should return by chteauroux , clermont - ferrand , le puy , and nmes; and , if i had any money , he prayed me to leave it for him at nmes , with an innkeeper with whom i had dealings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the smuggling line? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - eh , your excellency? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone must live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly; go on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i possessed a thousand francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i left five hundred with assunta , my sister - in - law , and with the other five hundred i set off for nmes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was easy to do so , and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea , everything favored my project . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , after we had taken in our cargo , the wind became contrary , so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rhne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last , however , we succeeded , and worked up to arles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i left the boat between bellegarde and beaucaire , and took the road to nmes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we are getting to the story now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three brigands , called trestaillon , truphemy , and graffan , publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of bonapartism . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have doubtless heard of these massacres , your excellency? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - vaguely; i was far from france at that period . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as i entered nmes , i literally waded in blood; at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers , who killed , plundered , and burned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified , not for myselffor i , a simple corsican fisherman , had nothing to fear; on the contrary , that time was most favorable for us smugglersbut for my brother , a soldier of the empire , returning from the army of the loire , with his uniform and his epaulets , there was everything to apprehend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my brother had arrived the previous evening at nmes , and , at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality , he had been assassinated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did all in my power to discover the murderers , but no one durst tell me their names , so much were they dreaded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much , and which feared nothing , and i went to the king s attorney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his zeal had procured him advancement , and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur ,  i said , my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nmes , i know not by whom , but it is your duty to find out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are the representative of justice here , and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - who was your brother?   asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a lieutenant in the corsican battalion . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - a soldier of the usurper , then?  <s> <s>  - a soldier of the french army . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - well ,  replied he , he has smitten with the sword , and he has perished by the sword . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - you are mistaken , monsieur ,  i replied; he has perished by the poniard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have already told youavenge him . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - on whom?  <s> <s>  - on his murderers . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - how should i know who they are?  <s> <s>  - order them to be sought for . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - why , your brother has been involved in a quarrel , and killed in a duel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor , but which are not suffered now , for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - monsieur ,  i replied , it is not for myself that i entreat your interferencei should grieve for him or avenge him , but my poor brother had a wife , and were anything to happen to me , the poor creature would perish from want , for my brother s pay alone kept her . </s> </s>

<s> <s> fortunately , i was so well concealed that he could not find me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , as you know , a corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance , so his carriage , fast as it went , was never above half a day s journey before me , who followed him on foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the most important thing was , not to kill him onlyfor i had an opportunity of doing so a hundred timesbut to kill him without being discoveredat least , without being arrested . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i no longer belonged to myself , for i had my sister - in - law to protect and provide for . </s> </s>

 <s> <s>  - one evening , as i was looking over the wall , i saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden , which was not overlooked by any windows , and i guessed that she was awaiting m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features , i saw she was from eighteen to nineteen , tall and very fair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure , i saw she would ere long become a mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few moments after , the little door was opened and a man entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young woman hastened to meet him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they threw themselves into each other s arms , embraced tenderly , and returned together to the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort; i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and , asked the count ,  - did you ever know the name of this woman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , excellency , returned bertuccio;  - you will see that i had no time to learn it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that evening , continued bertuccio ,  - i could have killed the procureur , but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood , i was fearful of not killing him on the spot , and that if his cries were overheard i might be taken; so i put it off until the next occasion , and in order that nothing should escape me , i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three days after , about seven o clock in the evening , i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop , and take the road to svres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three hours later , the man returned covered with dust , his errand was performed , and two minutes after , another man on foot , muffled in a mantle , opened the little door of the garden , which he closed after him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i crossed the street , and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall , and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this time i did not content myself with looking , but i took my knife out of my pocket , felt that the point was sharp , and sprang over the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my first care was to run to the door; he had left the key in it , taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing , then , preventing my escape by this means , i examined the grounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in order to go from the door to the house , or from the house to the door , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was the end of september; the wind blew violently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take , and scarcely was i there when , amidst the gusts of wind , i fancied i heard groans; but you know , or rather you do not know , your excellency , that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two hours passed thus , during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the last stroke died away , i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door opened , and the man in the mantle reappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the terrible moment had come , but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i drew my knife from my pocket again , opened it , and made ready to strike . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man in the mantle advanced towards me , but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was afraid , not of a struggle , but of a failure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort had this spade in his hands , when he stopped close to the thicket where i was , glanced round , and began to dig a hole in the earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , i confess , curiosity mingled with hatred; i wished to see what villefort was going to do there , and i remained motionless , holding my breath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then an idea crossed my mind , which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box , two feet long , and six or eight inches deep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i let him place the box in the hole he had made , then , while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation , i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast , exclaiming: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am giovanni bertuccio; thy death for my brother s; thy treasure for his widow; thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i know not if he heard these words; i think he did not , for he fell without a cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i felt his blood gush over my face , but i was intoxicated , i was delirious , and the blood refreshed , instead of burning me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , your excellency , returned bertuccio;  - it was a vendetta followed by restitution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and was the sum a large one? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was not money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , i recollect , replied the count;  - did you not say something of an infant? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new - born child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> its purple visage , and its violet - colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation , but as it was not yet cold , i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart , and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia , i did what a doctor would have donei inflated the lungs by blowing air into them , and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour , it began to breathe , and cried feebly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in my turn i uttered a cry , but a cry of joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road , and i inquired where the asylum was; the box confirmed my statement , the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents , the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a fortnight after i was at rogliano , and i said to assunta: </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - she demanded what i meant , and when i had told her all ,giovanni ,  said she , you should have brought this child with you; we would have replaced the parents it has lost , have called it benedetto , and then , in consequence of this good action , god would have blessed us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  in reply i gave her the half of the linen i had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an h and an n , surmounted by a baron s coronet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio , you make use of heraldic terms; where did you study heraldry? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on , i am curious to know two things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what are they , your excellency? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no excellency , i do not recollect telling you that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thought you did; i must have been mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , you were not , for it was in reality a little boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the story will be very long , excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know i take but little sleep , and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio bowed , and resumed his story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the southern districts were ill - watched in particular , in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon , nmes , or uzs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since my brother s assassination in the streets of nmes , i had never entered the town; the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected , seeing that we would no longer come to him , was forced to come to us , and had established a branch to his inn , on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire , at the sign of the pont du gard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we had thus , at aigues - mortes , martigues , or bouc , a dozen places where we left our goods , and where , in case of necessity , we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and custom - house officers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> smuggling is a profitable trade , when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed; as for myself , brought up in the mountains , i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom - house officers , as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry , and an inquiry always looks back into the past . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars , or barrels of brandy without a permit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , preferring death to capture , i accomplished the most astonishing deeds , and which , more than once , showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision , and vigorous and determined execution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - philosophy , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio , interrupted the count;  - you have done a little of everything in your life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , excellency! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> assunta took care of all , and our little fortune increased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i questioned her , but in vain; she would tell me nothing , and i departed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our expedition lasted nearly six weeks; we had been to lucca to take in oil , to leghorn for english cottons , and we ran our cargo without opposition , and returned home full of joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i uttered a cry of joy; the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had profited by my absence , and furnished with the half of the linen , and having written down the day and hour at which i had deposited the child at the asylum , had set off for paris , and had reclaimed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no objection was raised , and the infant was given up to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , i confess , your excellency , when i saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle , i felt my eyes filled with tears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , assunta ,  cried i , you are an excellent woman , and heaven will bless you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - this , said monte cristo ,  - is less correct than your philosophy ,it is only faith . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unfortunately , there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the proverb was but too correct as regarded benedetto , and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this child , for whom my poor sister would go to the town , five or six leagues off , to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats , preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves , the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor s orchard , or the dried apples in his loft , when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one day , when benedetto was about five or six , our neighbor wasilio , who , according to the custom of the country , never locked up his purse or his valuablesfor , as your excellency knows , there are no thieves in corsicacomplained that he had lost a louis out of his purse; we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money , but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day , benedetto , who had been gone from the house since morning , to our great anxiety , did not return until late in the evening , dragging a monkey after him , which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for more than a month past , the mischievous child , who knew not what to wish for , had taken it into his head to have a monkey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees ,  said i; confess how you obtained this animal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said , and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i became angry; he began to laugh , i threatened to strike him , and he made two steps backwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you cannot beat me ,  said he; you have no right , for you are not my father . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret , which we had so carefully concealed from him; however , it was this answer , in which the child s whole character revealed itself , that almost terrified me , and my arm fell without touching him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the boy triumphed , and this victory rendered him so audacious , that all the money of assunta , whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it , was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against , and follies she had not the courage to prevent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he was only eleven , he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty , the worst characters in bastia , or , indeed , in corsica , and they had already , for some mischievous pranks , been several times threatened with a prosecution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i became alarmed , as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he heard me patiently , and when i had finished , burst out laughing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you mad , uncle?   ( he called me by this name when he was in good humor ); do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existencemy agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself , exposed to the bitter frost at night , and the scorching heat by day , compelled to conceal yourself , and when you are perceived , receive a volley of bullets , all to earn a paltry sum? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , i have as much money as i want; mother assunta always furnishes me when i ask for it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> benedetto rejoined his associates , and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sweet child , murmured monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , had he been my own son , replied bertuccio ,  - or even my nephew , i would have brought him back to the right road , for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength , but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed , made it impossible for me to punish him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i gave my sister , who constantly defended the unfortunate boy , good advice , and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount , i showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> benedetto could read , write , and cipher perfectly , for when the fit seized him , he learned more in a day than others in a week . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship , and without letting him know anything of my plan , to convey him some morning on board; by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the most perfect tranquillity was restored , and the vigilance of the custom - house officers was redoubled , and their strictness was increased at this time , in consequence of the fair at beaucaire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - our expedition made a favorable beginning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whether success rendered us imprudent , or whether we were betrayed , i know not; but one evening , about five o clock , our little cabin - boy came breathlessly , to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom - house officers advancing in our direction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not their proximity that alarmed us , for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the rhne , but the care , according to the boy s account , that they took to avoid being seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was now safe , for i could swim along the ditch without being seen , and i reached the canal in safety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had designedly taken this direction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said monte cristo  - i perfectly recollect him; i think he was your colleague . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - precisely , answered bertuccio;  - but he had , seven or eight years before this period , sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles , who , having almost ruined himself in his old trade , wished to make his fortune in another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the count , who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccio s story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gaspard caderousse; he had married a woman from the village of carconte , and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was suffering from malarial fever , and seemed dying by inches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for her husband , he was a strapping fellow of forty , or five - and - forty , who had more than once , in time of danger , given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you say , interrupted monte cristo  - that this took place towards the year<s> <s>  - 1829 , your excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said monte cristo  - the evening of the 3rd of june , 1829 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter , and , as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road , i resolved not to break through the rule , so climbing over the garden - hedge , i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees , and fearing that caderousse might have some guest , i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night , and which was only separated from the inn by a partition , in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i stepped into the shed , and it was fortunate i did so , for at that moment caderousse entered with a stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i waited patiently , not to overhear what they said , but because i could do nothing else; besides , the same thing had occurred often before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of france; he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair , and who during the month the fair lasts , and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of europe , often have dealings to the amount of 100 ,000 to 150 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , seeing that the room was , as usual , empty , and only guarded by the dog , he called to his wife , hello , carconte ,  said he , the worthy priest has not deceived us; the diamond is real . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - an exclamation of joy was heard , and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i say that the diamond is real , and that this gentleman , one of the first jewellers of paris , will give us 50 ,000 francs for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only , in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us , he wishes you to relate to him , as i have done already , the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the meantime please to sit down , monsieur , and i will fetch you some refreshment . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh ,  returned she , it was a gift of heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my husband was a great friend , in 1814 or 1815 , of a sailor named edmond dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this poor fellow , whom caderousse had forgotten , had not forgotten him , and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - but how did he obtain it?   asked the jeweller; had he it before he was imprisoned?  <s> <s>  - no , monsieur; but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman , and as in prison he fell sick , and dants took the same care of him as if he had been his brother , the englishman , when he was set free , gave this stone to dants , who , less fortunate , died , and , in his turn , left it to us , and charged the excellent abb , who was here this morning , to deliver it . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the same story ,  muttered the jeweller; and improbable as it seemed at first , it may be true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there s only the price we are not agreed about . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - how not agreed about?   said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought we agreed for the price i asked . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> forty thousand ,  cried la carconte; we will not part with it for that sum . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - what was the abb s name?   asked the indefatigable questioner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the abb busoni ,  said la carconte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he was a foreigner?  <s> <s>  - an italian from the neighborhood of mantua , i believe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what did you think of this fine story , eavesdropper? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo;  - did you credit it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did not look on caderousse as a bad man , and i thought him incapable of committing a crime , or even a theft . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that did more honor to your heart than to your experience , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will give you 45 ,000 ,  said he , but not a sou more; besides , as that is the exact value of the stone , i brought just that sum with me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - oh , that s no matter ,  replied caderousse , i will go back with you to fetch the other 5 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - no ,  returned the jeweller , giving back the diamond and the ring to caderousse , no , it is worth no more , and i am sorry i offered so much , for the stone has a flaw in it , which i had not seen . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - at least , replace the diamond in the ring ,  said la carconte sharply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , true ,  replied the jeweller , and he reset the stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no matter ,  observed caderousse , replacing the box in his pocket , someone else will purchase it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he will inform against you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will have to find the abb busoni; and abbs who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the law would seize it , and put you in prison; if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty , the ring will be lost , or a false stone , worth three francs , will be given you , instead of a diamond worth 50 ,000 or perhaps 55 ,000 francs; from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in purchasing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no ,  said caderousse , we are not rich enough to lose 5 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - as you please , my dear sir ,  said the jeweller; i had , however , as you see , brought you the money in bright coin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse; it was plain that the small shagreen case , which he turned over and over in his hand , did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned towards his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he returns to beaucaire without the diamond , he will inform against us , and , as he says , who knows if we shall ever again see the abb busoni? in all probability we shall never see him . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - well , then , so i will!   said caderousse; so you may have the diamond for 45 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis , and the husband a pair of buckles , worth perhaps fifteen francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the abb told me it was worth 50 ,000 francs ,  muttered caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , comegive it to me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a strange fellow you are ,  said the jeweller , taking the diamond from his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i give you 45 ,000 francsthat is , 2 ,500 livres of income ,a fortune such as i wish i had myself , and you are not satisfied!  <s> <s>  - and the five - and - forty thousand francs ,  inquired caderousse in a hoarse voice , where are they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> comelet us see them . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - here they are ,  replied the jeweller , and he counted out upon the table 15 ,000 francs in gold , and 30 ,000 francs in bank - notes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait whilst i light the lamp ,  said la carconte; it is growing dark , and there may be some mistake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thunder growled in the distance; but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller , caderousse , or la carconte , absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes , then handed them to his wife , who counted and counted them again in her turn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during this time , the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight , and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those whichprecursors of the stormbegan to play in at the windows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well ,  inquired the jeweller , is the cash all right?  <s> <s>  - yes ,  said caderousse . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - la carconte went to a cupboard , and returned with an old leathern pocket - book and a bag . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the former she took some greasy letters , and put in their place the bank - notes , and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each , which , in all probability , formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - thank you ,  replied the jeweller , it must be getting late , and i must return to beaucairemy wife will be getting uneasy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he drew out his watch , and exclaimed , morbleu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nearly nine o clockwhy , i shall not get back to beaucaire before midnight! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good - night , my friends . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - in another week you will have left beaucaire ,  remarked caderousse , for the fair ends in a few days . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - true , but that makes no difference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> write to me at paris , to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you cannot think of going out in such weather as this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then there are robbers ,  said la carconte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the road is never very safe during fair time . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - oh , as to the robbers ,  said joannes , here is something for them ,  and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols , loaded to the muzzle . </s> </s>

<s> <s> oh ,  said he , this is very nice weather , and two leagues to go in such a storm . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - remain ,  said caderousse . </s> </s>

 <s> <s>  - yes; do stay ,  added la carconte in a tremulous voice; we will take every care of you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - no; i must sleep at beaucaire . </s> </s>

 <s> <s>  - particularly when there is money in the house , eh?   answered caderousse , double - locking the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he came into the room , went to the cupboard , took out the bag and pocket - book , and both began , for the third time , to count their gold and bank - notes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woman , especially , was hideous; her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified , her countenance had become livid , and her eyes resembled burning coals . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - ah ,  responded the woman , with an expression impossible to describe; i thought it was for something else . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - woman , womanwhy do you have such ideas?   cried caderousse; or , if you have them , why don t you keep them to yourself?  <s> <s>  - well ,  said la carconte , after a moment s pause , you are not a man . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - at the same moment , and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows a clap of thunder , they heard a knocking at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who s there?   cried caderousse , rising , and drawing up in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table , and which he covered with his two hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is i ,  shouted a voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who are you?  <s> <s>  - eh , pardieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> joannes , the jeweller . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - well , and you said i offended the good god ,  said la carconte with a horrid smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - la carconte , on the contrary , rose , and going with a firm step towards the door , opened it , saying , as she did so: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come in , dear m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> joannes . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - caderousse stammered out something , while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> la carconte double - locked the door behind the jeweller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the jeweller returned to the apartment , he cast around him a scrutinizing glancebut there was nothing to excite suspicion , if it did not exist , or to confirm it , if it were already awakened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse s hands still grasped the gold and bank - notes , and la carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - oh , no ,  answered caderousse , that was not my reason , i can assure you; but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected , as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune , and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the jeweller smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you any other guests in your house?   inquired he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nobody but ourselves ,  replied caderousse; the fact is , we do not lodge travellersindeed , our tavern is so near the town , that nobody would think of stopping here . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - then i am afraid i shall very much inconvenience you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not at all , my dear sir ,  said la carconte in her most gracious manner . </s> </s>

 <s> <s>  - surely that is where you yourselves sleep?  <s> <s>  - never mind that; we have a second bed in the adjoining room . </s> </s>

<s> <s> caderousse had once more parted with his treasurethe banknotes were replaced in the pocket - book , the gold put back into the bag , and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air , glancing from time to time at the jeweller , who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes , and merely changing his place on the warm hearth , to enable the whole of his garments to be dried . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - and you?   asked joannes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t want any supper ,  said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we dined so very late ,  hastily interposed la carconte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then it seems i am to eat alone ,  remarked the jeweller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you ,  answered la carconte , with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from time to time caderousse darted on his wife keen , searching glances , but rapid as the lightning flash . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the storm still continued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , there ,  said la carconte; do you hear that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon my word , you did well to come back . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - nevertheless ,  replied the jeweller , if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated , i shall make another start . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he sighed heavily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well ,  said the jeweller , as he placed himself at table , all i can say is , so much the worse for those who are abroad . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - yes ,  chimed in la carconte , they will have a wretched night of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her , so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind , or at least have greatly astonished him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse , meanwhile , continued to pace the room in gloomy silence , sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest; but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast , the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but as if to contradict his statement , at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation , while a sudden gust of wind , mingled with rain , extinguished the lamp he held in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - trembling and awe - struck , caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest , while la carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must be tired ,  said she to the jeweller; i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed; go up when you are ready , and sleep well . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury , but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that , instead of diminishing , the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased; resigning himself , therefore , to what seemed inevitable , he bade his host good - night , and mounted the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he passed over my head and i heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done; in fact , all that had happened ( with the exception of the story of the diamond , which certainly did wear an air of improbability ) , appeared natural enough , and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust; but , worn out as i was with fatigue , and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated , i determined to obtain a few hours  sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller , who , after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night , threw himself on his bed , and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - insensibly my eyelids grew heavy , deep sleep stole over me , and having no suspicion of anything wrong , i sought not to shake it off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near , and a bright light flashed over the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband , but as he made no sign of changing his position , she extended her hard , bony hand , and touched him on the forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - caderousse shuddered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not , when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol , followed by a fearful cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me , and the next instant a dull , heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the staircase creaked , he descended into the room below , approached the fire and lit a candle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having obtained the light , he hurried upstairs again , and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a moment later he came down again , holding in his hand the small shagreen case , which he opened , to assure himself it contained the diamond ,seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in , then , as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket , he deposited it in his red handkerchief , which he carefully rolled round his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - after this he took from his cupboard the bank - notes and gold he had put there , thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers , and the other into that of his waistcoat , hastily tied up a small bundle of linen , and rushing towards the door , disappeared in the darkness of the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for this purpose i applied all the strength i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which i lay to the adjoining room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts , and i found myself in the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hastily snatching up the lighted candle , i hurried to the staircase; about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat , leaving two gaping wounds from which , as well as the mouth , the blood was pouring in floods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was stone dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i strode past her , and ascended to the sleeping chamber , which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there , and the sheets , to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung , were dragged across the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the murdered man lay on the floor , his head leaning against the wall , and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast; there was a fourth gash , in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i approached the jeweller , who was not quite dead , and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor , he opened his eyes , fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze , moved his lips as though trying to speak , then , overcome by the effort , fell back and expired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses , and finding that i could no longer be of service to anyone in the house , my only desire was to fly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i rushed towards the staircase , clutching my hair , and uttering a groan of horror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon reaching the room below , i found five or six custom - house officers , and two or three gendarmesall heavily armed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they threw themselves upon me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i strove to speak , a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood - stained garments , i involuntarily surveyed myself , and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what does he mean?   asked a gendarme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i saw that they took me for the assassin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me , while i managed to stammer forth: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , indeed i did not!  <s> <s>  - a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stir but a step ,  said they , and you are a dead man . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - why should you threaten me with death ,  cried i , when i have already declared my innocence?  <s> <s>  - tush , tush ,  cried the men; keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nmes . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - alas , resistance was far from my thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror; and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horse s tail , and thus they took me to nmes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i had been tracked by a customs - officer , who had lost sight of me near the tavern; feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there , he had returned to summon his comrades , who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol , and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one only chance was left me , that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abb busoni , who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part , while i must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i declared could exculpate me if he would . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him , and how minutely i related the whole of what i had seen and heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then it was that , won by his mild charity , seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country , and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which i was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind , i besought him to receive my confession , under the seal of which i recounted the auteuil affair in all its details , as well as every other transaction of my life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he quitted me , he bade me be of good courage , and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse , who was discovered in some distant country , and brought back to france , where he made a full confession , refusing to make the fact of his wife s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life , and i was immediately set at liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then it was , i presume , said monte cristo  - that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abb busoni? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your mode of life as a smuggler ,  said he to me one day , will be the ruin of you; if you get out , don t take it up again . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - but how ,  inquired i , am i to maintain myself and my poor sister?  <s> <s>  - a person , whose confessor i am ,  replied he , and who entertains a high regard for me , applied to me a short time since to procure him a confidential servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would you like such a post? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if so , i will give you a letter of introduction to him . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - oh , father ,  i exclaimed , you are very good . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i extended my hand , and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate , but he stopped me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow ,  said he; i know and admire the corsican nature too well to fear you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , take this ,  continued he , after rapidly writing the few lines i brought to your excellency , and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service , and proudly i ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied the count;  - i take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully , bertuccio; but you might have shown more confidence in me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i , your excellency? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister , i lost no time in hastening to corsica , but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning , the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> acting by my advice , my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto , who was continually tormenting her for money , as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired , and disappeared and remained away all day , leaving the kind - hearted assunta , who loved him as if he were her own child , to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> evening came , and still , with all the patient solicitude of a mother , she watched for his return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she stretched out her arms to him , but they seized hold of her , and one of the threenone other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - put her to torture and she ll soon tell us where her money is . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - it unfortunately happened that our neighbor , wasilio , was at bastia , leaving no person in his house but his wife; no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two held poor assunta , who , unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her , smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows , then returned , and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations , and then dragged assunta feet foremost towards the brazier , expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the struggle her clothes caught fire , and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> covered with flames , assunta rushed wildly to the door , but it was fastened; she flew to the windows , but they were also secured; then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks; it was assunta calling for help . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cries died away in groans , and next morning , as soon as wasilio s wife could muster up courage to venture abroad , she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities , when assunta , although dreadfully burnt , was found still breathing; every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open , and the money stolen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency , to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto , since all trace of him seemed entirely lost; or of my sister , since she was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and in what light did you view the occurrence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as a punishment for the crime i had committed , answered bertuccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , those villeforts are an accursed race! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - truly they are , murmured the count in a lugubrious tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb busoni did right to send you to me , he went on in his ordinary tone ,  - and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history , as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for that benedetto , who so grossly belied his name , have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone , or what has become of him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself , i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not think so , bertuccio , replied the count;  - for the wicked are not so easily disposed of , for god seems to have them under his special watch - care to make of them instruments of his vengeance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so be it , responded bertuccio ,  - all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now , your excellency , he added , bowing his head ,  - you know everythingyou are my judge on earth , as the almighty is in heaven; have you for me no words of consolation? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you , and , perhaps , to others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> benedetto , if still living , will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other , and then be duly punished in his turn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ask yourself , wherefore , after rescuing the infant from its living grave , you did not restore it to its mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was the crime , bertucciothat was where you became really culpable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps , too , the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , again , i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words , while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination ( the last we shall ever hold upon this subject ) , i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abb busoni . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for all evils there are two remediestime and silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the very circumstances which inflict on you , as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here , such painful emotions , are to me , on the contrary , a source of something like contentment , and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs , while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination , and furnished with thickly grown trees , beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this to me , who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall , is , i assure you , a most agreeable surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have no fear of ghosts , and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> retire within , bertuccio , and tranquillize your mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the abb busoni , send for me , if i am still on earth , and i will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here , beneath this plane - tree , must have been where the infant s grave was dug . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is the little door opening into the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after making the tour of the garden a second time , the count re - entered his carriage , while bertuccio , who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features , took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it is half - past eleven o clock; hayde will soon be here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali , having pointed to the apartments , held up three fingers of his right hand , and then , placing it beneath his head , shut his eyes , and feigned to sleep . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then offer him double that sum; a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the steward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have to pay a visit this evening , replied he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i desire that these horses , with completely new harness , may be at the door with my carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio bowed , and was about to retire; but when he reached the door , he paused , and then said ,  - at what o clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at five o clock , replied the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i beg your excellency s pardon , interposed the steward in a deprecating manner ,  - for venturing to observe that it is already two o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , turning towards ali , he said ,  - let all the horses in my stables be led before the windows of your young lady , that she may select those she prefers for her carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me; if so , let dinner be served in her apartments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistin bowed low . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , your excellency! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed baptistin eagerly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , if you please , till i have finished speaking , replied monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you receive 1 ,500 francs per annum for your services heremore than many a brave subaltern , who continually risks his life for his country , obtains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , though yourself a servant , you have other servants to wait upon you , take care of your clothes , and see that your linen is duly prepared for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again , you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet , amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not condemning you for this , monsieur baptistin; but let your profits end here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i neither ill - use nor ill - treat my servants by word or action . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an error i readily forgive , but wilful negligence or forgetfulness , never . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my commands are ordinarily short , clear , and precise; and i would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice , or even three times , than they should be misunderstood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know , and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you may now retire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistin bowed , and was proceeding towards the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have been in my service a year , your fund has already begun to accumulatelet it continue to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this address , delivered in the presence of ali , who , not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken , stood wholly unmoved , produced an effect on m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he cannot possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct , not being , as you are , a paid servant , but a mere slavea dog , who , should he fail in his duty towards me , i should not discharge from my service , but kill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you seem incredulous , said monte cristo , who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the nubian smiled assentingly to his master s words , then , kneeling on one knee , respectfully kissed the hand of the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - my horses , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> does your excellency wish me to accompany him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , the coachman , ali , and baptistin will go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he passed them he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , your excellency , i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them , and , as it is , they have cost an enormous price . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , if your excellency is satisfied , it is all that i could wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whither does your excellency desire to be driven? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to the residence of baron danglars , rue de la chausse d antin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace , from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriage - drive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have another commission for you , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio , said he;  - i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandyfor instance , between le havre and boulogne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see i give you a wide range . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor , creek , or bay , into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she draws only fifteen feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description , and when you have met with an eligible spot , visit it , and if it possess the advantages desired , purchase it at once in your own name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , your excellency; i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and the yacht . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  tis well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and the steamboat? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is at chlons? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when you have purchased the estate i desire , i want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency may depend upon me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count made a gesture of satisfaction , descended the terrace steps , and sprang into his carriage , which was whirled along swiftly to the banker s house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars was engaged at that moment , presiding over a railroad committee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the count s title sounded on his ear he rose , and addressing his colleagues , who were members of one or the other chamber , he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentlemen , pardon me for leaving you so abruptly; but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred , which is this ,thomson & french , the roman bankers , have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo , and have given him an unlimited credit with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions , and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , would you believe it , he was not receiving . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i made inquiries , and found that the house in the champs - lyses is his own property , and certainly it was very decently kept up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles ,  - an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am very anxious to see this man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i suspect a hoax is intended , but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they laugh best who laugh last!  <s> <s> having delivered himself of this pompous address , uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath , he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing - room , whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chausse d antin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown , with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a slight inclination of the head , danglars signed to the count to be seated , pointing significantly to a gilded armchair , covered with white satin embroidered with gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count sat down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have the honor , i presume , of addressing m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , monsieur , said danglars with affected carelessness ,  - i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions; but the fact is , i was made baron , and also chevalier of the legion of honor , in return for services rendered , but<s> <s>  - but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de montmorency and lafayette? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , replied danglars ,  - not entirely so; with the servants ,you understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see; to your domestics you are my lord ,  the journalists style you monsieur ,  while your constituents call you citizen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i understand perfectly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again danglars bit his lips; he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort , and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am glad to hear it , baron ,for i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as regards the letter of advice , i am charmed to find that it has reached you; that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have received a regular letter of advice? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said danglars ,  - but i confess i didn t quite comprehend its meaning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you , in order to beg for an explanation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on , monsieur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , said danglars ,  - in the letteri believe i have it about mehere he felt in his breast - pocket - yes , here it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , baron , what is there difficult to understand about that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - merely the term unlimitednothing else , certainly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is not that word known in france? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the people who wrote are anglo - germans , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , as for the composition of the letter , there is nothing to be said; but as regards the competency of the document , i certainly have doubts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it possible? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the count , assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray tell me what you think , baron , for i feel uneasy , i can assure you , having some considerable property in their hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is , in fact , unlimited , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now what is vague is doubtful; and it was a wise man who said , when in doubt , keep out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - plainly enough; messrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thomson & french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars have their limits; he is a wise man , according to his own showing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur , replied the banker , drawing himself up with a haughty air ,  - the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems , then , reserved for me , said monte cristo coldly ,  - to be the first to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by what right , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by right of the objections you have raised , and the explanations you have demanded , which certainly must have some motive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once more danglars bit his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo on the contrary , preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor , aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure , and thus possessed the advantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , sir , resumed danglars , after a brief silence ,  - i will endeavor to make myself understood , by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so throwing himself back in his armchair , he said , with an arrogant and purse - proud air: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes; you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars , however limited , are still equal to meeting the largest demands; and were you even to require a million<s> <s>  - i beg your pardon , interposed monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but could i do with a million? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> retorted the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear sir , if a trifle like that could suffice me , i should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carrying in my pocket - book or dressing - case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the effect of the present revelation was stunning; he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i understand , and foreseeing that such might be the case , i took , in spite of my ignorance of affairs , certain precautions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lafitte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , sir , you have but to say the word , and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the blow had struck home , and danglars was entirely vanquished; with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count , who held them carelessly between finger and thumb , and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures , with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting , had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , sir , said danglars , after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held , and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him , - three letters of unlimited credit! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can be no longer mistrustful , but you must pardon me , my dear count , for confessing to some degree of astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , answered monte cristo , with the most gentlemanly air ,  -  tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whatever you say , my dear count; i am at your orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , replied monte cristo ,  - since we mutually understand each otherfor such i presume is the case? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars bowed assentingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my dear count , exclaimed danglars ,  - i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , you merely wished to be convinced , nothing more; but now that we have come to so clear an understanding , and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest , we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year , suppose we say six millions to<s> <s>  - six millions! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gasped danglars - so be it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , if i should require more , continued monte cristo in a careless manner ,  - why , of course , i should draw upon you; but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year , and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , we shall see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall be at home till midday , or if not , i will leave a receipt with my steward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the money you desire shall be at your house by ten o clock tomorrow morning , my dear count , replied danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how would you like to have it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in gold , silver , or notes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - half in gold , and the other half in bank - notes , if you please , said the count , rising from his seat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must confess to you , count , said danglars ,  - that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe , and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> may i presume to ask whether you have long possessed it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it has been in the family a very long while , returned monte cristo ,  - a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years , during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago , and they have only been employed by me within the last few years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your ignorance on the subject , therefore , is easily accounted for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with your tastes , and means of gratifying them , continued danglars ,  - you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you will permit me , i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery , composed entirely of works by the ancient masterswarranted as such . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not a modern picture among them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot endure the modern school of painting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen , bartoloni , and canova? all foreign artists , for , as you may perceive , i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have a right to be unjust to them , monsieur; they are your compatriots . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but all this may come later , when we shall be better known to each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the present , i will confine myself ( if perfectly agreeable to you ) to introducing you to the baroness danglarsexcuse my impatience , my dear count , but a client like you is almost like a member of the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , my lord , answered the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , my lord , madame has visitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired danglars , with an air of indulgence and good - nature that made monte cristo smile , acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker s domestic life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , my lord , replied the servant ,  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have not the honor of knowing madame danglars; but i have already met m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars;  - and where was that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i forget how , but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by all means , replied monte cristo;  - i follow you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the baron , followed by the count , traversed a long series of apartments , in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth , until he reached the boudoir of madame danglarsa small octagonal - shaped room , hung with pink satin , covered with white indian muslin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the truth was , it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars and his architect , who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars ( who , although past the first bloom of youth , was still strikingly handsome ) was now seated at the piano , a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work , while lucien debray , standing before a small work - table , was turning over the pages of an album . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lucien had found time , preparatory to the count s arrival , to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf; and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings , he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count , consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly - colored tinge of his own heated imagination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf , it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to , and fully credited , all the additional circumstances detailed by debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in paris court his notice , and that is , that he has come to take up his abode in paris for a year , during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that means balls , dinners , and lawn parties without end , in all of which i trust the count will remember us , as he may depend upon it we shall him , in our own humble entertainments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address , madame danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months , and who had selected paris for the scene of his princely extravagance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yesterday morning , madame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , madame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> paris is a horrible place in summer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> balls , parties , and ftes are over; the italian opera is in london; the french opera everywhere except in paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the thatre franais , you know , of course , that it is nowhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the champ - de - mars and satory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you propose entering any horses at either of these races , count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall do whatever they do at paris , madame , if i have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you fond of horses , count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , count , said the baroness ,  - it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see , madame , how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir; approaching her mistress , she spoke some words in an undertone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i cannot believe it; the thing is impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i assure you , madame , replied the woman ,  - it is as i have said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is what true , madame? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired danglars , visibly agitated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what does she tell you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage , he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i desire to know what is the meaning of this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be kind enough , madame , to listen to me , said danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes; i will listen , monsieur , for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these two gentlemen shall decide between us; but , first , i will state the case to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gentlemen , continued the baroness ,  - among the ten horses in the stables of baron danglars , are two that belong exclusively to mea pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to you , at least , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , i had promised madame de villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the bois; but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gonepositively gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , what a detestable crew they are , these mercenary speculators! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame , replied danglars ,  - the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you; they were scarcely four years old , and they made me extremely uneasy on your account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nonsense , retorted the baroness;  - you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject , because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , perhaps , you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are setting up an establishment , of course? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , yes , replied the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have almost given them away , as it is; but , as i before said , i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were only fit for a young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me , said monte cristo;  - but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriage - horses , and i do not think they were dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there they are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , you are a connoisseur , i believe , let me have your opinion upon them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as debray walked towards the window , danglars approached his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i could not tell you before others , said he in a low tone ,  - the reason of my parting with the horses; but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there , what do you think now of the affair? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wasn t i right to part with the horses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - great heavens? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the very animals we were speaking of , harnessed to the count s carriage! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dappled grays? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars looked absolutely stupefied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i scarcely know , replied the count;  - it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward , and cost mewell , somewhere about 30 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray conveyed the count s reply to the baroness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - see , said the count ,  - how very ungrateful women are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your kind attention , in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses , does not seem to have made the least impression on her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but so it is; a woman will often , from mere wilfulness , prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore , in my opinion , my dear baron , the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies , and allow them to act as they please , and then , if any mischief follows , why , at least , they have no one to blame but themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars made no reply; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness , whose frowning brow , like that of olympic jove , predicted a storm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , who perceived the gathering clouds , and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars  rage , suddenly recollected an appointment , which compelled him to take his leave; while monte cristo , unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain , made a farewell bow and departed , leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all has gone according to my wishes . </s> </s>

<s> <s> with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two hours afterwards , madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count , in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite  - dappled grays , protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman s regrets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to danglars monte cristo also wrote , requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire , and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the evening , monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil , accompanied by ali . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the following day , about three o clock , a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i thought i did not mistake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with your lasso you could stop an ox? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - or a tiger? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a lion even? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali sprung forwards , imitating the action of one throwing the lasso , then of a strangled lion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i understand , said monte cristo;  - you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the nubian smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is well , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then listen to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count patted him gently on the shoulder , his usual mode of praising ali , who , pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him , walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house , and , seating himself thereon , began to smoke his chibouque , while monte cristo re - entered his dwelling , perfectly assured of the success of his plan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street , pacing the chamber with restless steps , stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels , then to cast an anxious glance on ali; but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each other s arms . </s> </s>

<s> <s> ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque , drew the lasso from his pocket , threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold , and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock , then the animal fell over on the pole , which snapped , and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gladly availing himself of this opportunity , the coachman leaped from his box; but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse , and held them in his iron grasp , till the beast , snorting with pain , sunk beside his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo carried them both to the salon , and deposited them on a sofa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - compose yourself , madame , said he;  - all danger is over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woman looked up at these words , and , with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been , pointed to her child , who still continued insensible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i understand the nature of your alarms , madame , said the count , carefully examining the child ,  - but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness; your little charge has not received the least injury; his insensibility is merely the effects of terror , and will soon pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , sir , in pity send for a physician; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand , monte cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions; then , opening a casket that stood near , he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold , containing a liquid of the color of blood , of which he let fall a single drop on the child s lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely had it reached them , ere the boy , though still pale as marble , opened his eyes , and eagerly gazed around him . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars  beautiful horses , and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it possible , exclaimed the count with well - feigned astonishment ,  - that these horses belong to the baroness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they do , indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame danglars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have that honor; and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron; but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them , i ventured to send them back to her , with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are , then , doubtless , the count of monte cristo , of whom hermine has talked to me so much? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have rightly guessed , madame , replied the count . </s> </s>

<s> <s> most certainly , but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant , this dear child and myself must both have perished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , i still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i beseech you , madame , replied monte cristo  - not to spoil ali , either by too great praise or rewards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali is my slave , and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , interposed madame de villefort , on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression ,  - nay , but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his life , madame , belongs not to him; it is mine , in return for my having myself saved him from death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort , monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms , lavishing on him the most tender endearments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the child was small for his age , and unnaturally pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a mass of straight black hair , defying all attempts to train or curl it , fell over his projecting forehead , and hung down to his shoulders , giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his mouth was large , and the lips , which had not yet regained their color , were particularly thin; in fact , the deep and crafty look , giving a predominant expression to the child s face , belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort became very pale , and , seizing her son s arm , drew him anxiously toward her; but , once satisfied of his safety , she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket , which was not lost upon the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at sight of him madame de villefort uttered an expression of pleasure , and , holding the child still closer towards her , she said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - edward , dearest , do you see that good man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has shown very great courage and resolution , for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us , and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes , while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this lady , said the count , speaking to ali in the arabic language ,  - is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives; but the boy refuses , saying you are too ugly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you permit me to inquire , said madame de villefort , as she arose to take her leave ,  - whether you usually reside here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i do not , replied monte cristo;  - it is a small place i have purchased quite lately . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you will see , replied monte cristo ,  - that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali had , indeed , given proof of this; for , approaching the animals , who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty , he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar , and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him; but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your horses got as far as ranelagh , when they darted forward like mad things , and galloped away at so fearful a rate , that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress , when a strange - looking man ,an arab , a negro , or a nubian , at least a black of some nation or otherat a signal from the count , whose domestic he is , suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals , even at the risk of being trampled to death himself; and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count then hastened to us , and took us into his house , where he speedily recalled my poor edward to life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sent us home in his own carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yours will be returned to you tomorrow . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the count , however , has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days  rest , with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time , will bring them back to as fine , that is as terrifying , a condition as they were in yesterday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday; but , after all , i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses , more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo ,and certainly that illustrious personage , apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of , seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i , for one , delight in solving at any risk , even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses . </s> </s>

<s> <s> standing well at court , whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch , whether the government was doctrinaire liberal , or conservative; looked upon by all as a man of talent , since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded; hated by many , but warmly supported by others , without being really liked by anybody , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort held a high position in the magistracy , and maintained his eminence like a harlay or a mol . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his drawing - room , under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage , scarcely eighteen , was still one of the well - regulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort was not only a magistrate , he was almost a diplomatist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his relations with the former court , of which he always spoke with dignity and respect , made him respected by the new one , and he knew so many things , that not only was he always carefully considered , but sometimes consulted . </s> </s>

<s> <s> occasionally , but seldom , he played at whist , and then care was taken to select partners worthy of himsometimes they were ambassadors , sometimes archbishops , or sometimes a prince , or a president , or some dowager duchess . </s> </s>

<s> <s> nature , according to her way , had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from being slender he had now become meagre; once pale , he was now yellow; his deep - set eyes were hollow , and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he dressed entirely in black , with the exception of his white tie , and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button - hole , and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - sir , said villefort , in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods , and of which they cannot , or will not , divest themselves in society ,  - sir , the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have come , therefore , to discharge this duty , and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - monsieur , replied the count , with a chilling air ,  - i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother , for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all; and the good fortune which occurred to me , monsieur , might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which , in its discharge , confers an undoubtedly great honor; for i am aware that m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> villefort , astonished at this reply , which he by no means expected , started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears , and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he glanced around , in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn , and seemed to fall easily on a topic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you seem geographically engaged , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , replied the count;  - i have sought to make of the human race , taken in the mass , what you practice every day on individualsa physiological study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is an algebraic axiom , which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity , and not from an unknown to a known; but sit down , sir , i beg of you . </s> </s>

<s> <s> thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor , having his back towards the window , his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment ,a conversation which assumed , as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf , a turn analogous to the persons , if not to the situation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , in truth , sir , was monte cristo s reply ,  - man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope; but you said , i think , that i had nothing else to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , really , let me ask , sir , have you? do you believe you have anything to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong , or rather , to say the truth more exactly , it was the first time he had ever heard of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the procureur exerted himself to reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yesyes , i do , sir; it is the pede claudo of the ancients . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know all that , for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myselfit is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice , and i must say , sir , that it is the law of primitive nations , that is , the law of retaliation , that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it may , perhaps , come to this in time , observed monte cristo;  - you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple , and simplicity is always perfection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the meanwhile , continued the magistrate ,  - our codes are in full force , with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs , roman laws , and frank usages; the knowledge of all which , you will agree , is not to be acquired without extended labor; it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge , and , when acquired , a strong power of brain to retain it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the english , turkish , japanese , hindu laws , are as familiar to me as the french laws , and thus i was right , when i said to you , that relatively ( you know that everything is relative , sir )that relatively to what i have done , you have very little to do; but that relatively to all i have learned , you have yet a great deal to learn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but with what motive have you learned all this? </s> </s>

<s> <s> monte cristo smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pray , sir , explain yourself , said villefort , more and more astonished ,  - i really donotunderstand youperfectly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i say , sir , that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations , you see only the springs of the machine , and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act; i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office - holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king; and that the men whom god has put above those office - holders , ministers , and kings , by giving them a mission to follow out , instead of a post to filli say that they escape your narrow , limited field of observation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is thus that human weakness fails , from its debilitated and imperfect organs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said villefort , more and more amazed , and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman ,  - you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned? </s> </s>

<s> <s> said monte cristo coldly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your pardon , sir , replied villefort , quite astounded ,  - but you will excuse me if , when i presented myself to you , i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - really , sir , retorted the count ,  - have you attained the eminent situation in which you are , without having admitted , or even without having met with exceptions? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law , but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession , a steel probe to search hearts , a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i really never heard a person speak as you do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions , and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - but can you not say that , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is to say , replied villefort with hesitation ,  - that human nature being weak , every man , according to your creed , has committed faults . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the stone seems very brilliant , answered the count . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - no , returned monte cristo  - i only guessed . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself , with its thickly planted courtyard , opening into the faubourg saint - honor , and to the garden shut in by this gate , which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen - garden of about an acre . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - oh , i am aware of that , said madame de villefort;  - but i have a passion for the occult sciences , which speak to the imagination like poetry , and are reducible to figures , like an algebraic equation; but go on , i beg of you; what you say interests me to the greatest degree . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i do not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and the more , madame , said monte cristo ,  - as the orientals do not confine themselves , as did mithridates , to make a cuirass of his poisons , but they also made them a dagger . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it is quite frightful , but deeply interesting , said the young lady , motionless with attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thought , i must confess , that these tales , were inventions of the middle ages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , no doubt , but improved upon by ours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is the use of time , rewards of merit , medals , crosses , monthyon prizes , if they do not lead society towards more complete perfection? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy; he does know how to destroy , and that is half the battle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , added madame de villefort , constantly returning to her object ,  - the poisons of the borgias , the medicis , the renes , the ruggieris , and later , probably , that of baron de trenck , whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance<s> <s>  - were objects of art , madame , and nothing more , replied the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by no means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , for instance , the excellent abb adelmonte , of whom i spoke just now , made in this way some marvellous experiments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had a remarkably fine garden , full of vegetables , flowers , and fruit . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death , a vulture is flying by ( there are a good many vultures in adelmonte s country ); this bird darts on the dead fowl , and carries it away to a rock , where it dines off its prey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three days afterwards , this poor vulture , which has been very much indisposed since that dinner , suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds , and falls heavily into a fish - pond . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - precisely so , cried monte cristo - precisely so; and this is what i said to my worthy adelmonte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he reflected , smiled , and replied to me by a sicilian proverb , which i believe is also a french proverb , my son , the world was not made in a daybut in seven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> return on sunday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  on the sunday following i did return to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic , he had watered it this time with a solution of salts , having their basis in strychnine , strychnos colubrina , as the learned term it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world , and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust; yet , five minutes afterwards , the rabbit was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fowl pecked at the rabbit , and the next day was a dead hen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fowl had not been poisonedshe had died of apoplexy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls , i believe , but very common among men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is very fortunate , she observed ,  - that such substances could only be prepared by chemists; otherwise , all the world would be poisoning each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry , said monte cristo carelessly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really , madame , this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours , but which would easily yield before sound reasoning . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow - creature , or will administer to him , in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation , that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such a thing is really out of ruleeccentric or stupid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to attain such a point , the blood must be heated to thirty - six degrees , the pulse be , at least , at ninety , and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but suppose one pass , as is permissible in philology , from the word itself to its softened synonym , then , instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination;  you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way , and that without shock or violence , without the display of the sufferings which , in the case of becoming a punishment , make a martyr of the victim , and a butcher , in every sense of the word , of him who inflicts them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then there will be no blood , no groans , no convulsions , and above all , no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act ,then one escapes the clutch of the human law , which says , do not disturb society!   this is the mode in which they manage these things , and succeed in eastern climes , where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yet conscience remains , remarked madame de villefort in an agitated voice , and with a stifled sigh . </s> </s>

<s> <s> madame de villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes , delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a moment s silence , the lady inquired: </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - oh , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first place , let us agree that the word poison does not exist , because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons , which become , according as they are employed , most salutary remedies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a skilful preparation of my friend s the worthy abb adelmonte , who taught me the use of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - most assuredly , responded madame de villefort in the same tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as for me , so nervous , and so subject to fainting fits , i should require a doctor adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and tranquillizing my mind , in the fear i have of dying some fine day of suffocation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the meanwhile , as the thing is difficult to find in france , and your abb is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account , i must continue to use monsieur planche s anti - spasmodics; and mint and hoffman s drops are among my favorite remedies . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - undoubtedly , and so should i prefer it , after the effects i have seen produced; but of course it is a secret , and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how kind you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - only remember one thinga small dose is a remedy , a large one is poison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one drop will restore life , as you have seen; five or six will inevitably kill , and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as , poured into a glass of wine , it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i say no more , madame; it is really as if i were prescribing for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the clock struck half - past six , and a lady was announced , a friend of madame de villefort , who came to dine with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time , count , instead of only for the second , said madame de villefort;  - if i had had the honor of being your friend , instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you , i should insist on detaining you to dinner , and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have promised to escort to the acadmie a greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera , and who relies on me to conduct her thither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , in truth , madame , to do that i must forget the hour s conversation i have had with you , which is indeed impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo bowed , and left the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort remained immersed in thought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to monte cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good , said he , as he went away;  - this is a fruitful soil , and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible , as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the acadmie royale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morcerf , like most other young men of rank and fortune , had his orchestra stall , with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance; he had , moreover , his right of entry into the omnibus box . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened that on this particular night the minister s box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray , who offered it to the comte de morcerf , who again , upon his rejection of it by mercds , sent it to danglars , with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening , in the event of their accepting the box in question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous opera - box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire , who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king s ransom in his waistcoat pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars had , however , protested against showing himself in a ministerial box , declaring that his political principles , and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself; the baroness had , therefore , despatched a note to lucien debray , bidding him call for them , it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugnie to the opera . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort , while the addition of a third , in the person of her mother s admitted lover , enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill - nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curtain rose , as usual , to an almost empty house , it being one of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance , so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it , that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals , while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors , and the buzz of conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - surely , said albert , as the door of a box on the first circle opened ,  - that must be the countess g . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who is the countess g? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a question! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , do you know , baron , i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it; as if all the world did not know who the countess g was . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know her , it seems? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - franz introduced me to her at rome , replied albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music , produced not the slightest effect on the two young men , who continued their conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bless me , i quite forgot the races . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you bet? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , merely a paltry fifty louis . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i staked on him . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes; there was the prize given by the jockey cluba gold cup , you knowand a very singular circumstance occurred about that race . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what was it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , shut up! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again interposed some of the audience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fact was , nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of vampa , or that of a jockey styled job , when , at the last moment , a splendid roan , mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist , presented themselves at the starting - post . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider s pockets , to make him weight; but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare , against whom he ran , by at least three whole lengths . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you say that the horse was entered under the name of vampa? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exactly; that was the title . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , answered albert ,  - i am better informed than you are , and know who the owner of that horse was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the pit in chorus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leisurely turning round , they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them , as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence; but as no one responded to the challenge , the friends turned again to the front of the theatre , and affected to busy themselves with the stage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ha , ha , said chteau - renaud ,  - here come some friends of yours , viscount! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are you looking at there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t you see they are trying to catch your eye? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , barring all that , i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , for that very resemblance affrights me; i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua; but this chase - loving diana , continually surrounded by her nymphs , gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of acton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was beautiful , but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste; her hair was raven black , but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious; her eyes , of the same color as her hair , were surmounted by well - arched brows , whose great defect , however , consisted in an almost habitual frown , while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sexher nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her mouth , which might have been found fault with as too large , displayed teeth of pearly whiteness , rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips , contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste , was a dark mole , of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are , placed just at the corner of her mouth; and the effect tended to increase the expression of self - dependence that characterized her countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as regarded her attainments , the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty , that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was a perfect linguist , a first - rate artist , wrote poetry , and composed music; to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted , following it with an indefatigable perseverance , assisted by a schoolfellow ,a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day , who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice , which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life; and acting upon this principle , the banker s daughter , though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise d armilly ( that was the name of the young virtuosa ) to practice with her through the day , took especial care not to be seen in her company . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame danglars into her box , the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half - hour s interval allowed between the acts , and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies , or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party , and she whispered her expectations to her daughter , that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mademoiselle eugnie , however , merely returned a dissenting movement of the head , while , with a cold smile , she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle , in which sat the countess g , and where morcerf had just made his appearance . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - to be sure , i remember it all now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see , it s evident where the count got the name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him? </s> </s>

<s> <s> besides , his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven<s> <s>  - oh , but that is dreadful! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , the man must owe me a fearful grudge . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i therefore maintain , in spite of morcerf , that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment , but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which , after all , may be his ordinary mode of existence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the countess . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - what , said debray , laughing;  - do you really mean you would go to his house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have ample proof to the contrary , if you look opposite , said the baroness , as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed debray;  - that girl is not his wife: he told us himself she was his slave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , said the baroness ,  - if slave she be , she has all the air and manner of a princess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of the arabian nights  . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , diamondsand she is covered with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to me she seems overloaded , observed eugnie;  - she would look far better if she wore fewer , and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed madame danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my poor eugnie , you must conceal your passion for the fine arts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i admire all that is beautiful , returned the young lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you think of the count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count , repeated eugnie , as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner;  - the count? oh , he is so dreadfully pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i quite agree with you , said morcerf;  - and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then the countess g has returned to paris , has she? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is that she , mamma? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked eugnie;  - almost opposite to us , with that profusion of beautiful light hair? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said madame danglars ,  - that is she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - command me , madame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , you should go and bring your count of monte cristo to us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked eugnie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , to converse with him , of course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you really no desire to meet him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - none whatever , replied eugnie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he will very probably come of his own accord , said morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there; do you see , madame , he recognizes you , and bows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said morcerf ,  - i may as well be magnanimous , and tear myself away to forward your wishes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go straight to his box; that will be the simplest plan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i have never been presented . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you say she is only a slave? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no; i hope that when he sees me leave you , he will come out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am going , said albert , as he made his parting bow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just as he was passing the count s box , the door opened , and monte cristo came forth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after giving some directions to ali , who stood in the lobby , the count took albert s arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> carefully closing the box door , ali placed himself before it , while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , said monte cristo ,  - paris is a strange city , and the parisians a very singular people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see that cluster of persons collected around poor ali , who is as much astonished as themselves; really one might suppose he was the only nubian they had ever beheld . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now i can promise you , that a frenchman might show himself in public , either in tunis , constantinople , bagdad , or cairo , without being treated in that way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that shows that the eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , as far as ali is concerned , i can assure you , the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendantyou , who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what has procured me so flattering a distinction? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you give away horses worth a thousand louis; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty; under the name of major black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots; then , when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory , instead of setting any value on it , you give it to the first handsome woman you think of! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who has filled your head with all this nonsense? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , in the first place , i heard it from madame danglars , who , by the by , is dying to see you in her box , or to have you seen there by others; secondly , i learned it from beauchamp s journal; and thirdly , from my own imagination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have been looking for him , but without success . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in what part of the house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the baroness s box , i believe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that charming young woman with her is her daughter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i congratulate you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morcerf smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what do you think of the music? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what music? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , the music you have been listening to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , it is well enough as the production of a human composer , sung by featherless bipeds , to quote the late diogenes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from which it would seem , my dear count , that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are right , in some degree; when i wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to , i go to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then sleep here , my dear count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , thank you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your orchestra is too noisy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to sleep after the manner i speak of , absolute calm and silence are necessary , and then a certain preparation<s> <s>  - i knowthe famous hashish! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - precisely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , my dear viscount , whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you mean at rome? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , then , i suppose you heard hayde s guzla; the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will excuse my leaving you , said the count , turning in the direction of his box . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what message shall i convey to the baroness! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that , with her permission , i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the third act had begun; and during its progress the count of morcerf , according to his promise , made his appearance in the box of madame danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement; his presence , therefore , was wholly unnoticed , save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hayde , whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage , like all unsophisticated natures , delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the third act passed off as usual . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mesdemoiselles noblet , julia , and leroux executed the customary pirouettes; robert duly challenged the prince of granada; and the royal father of the princess isabella , taking his daughter by the hand , swept round the stage with majestic strides , the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count left his box , and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars , who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are welcome , count! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she exclaimed , as he entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have been most anxious to see you , that i might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your remembrance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but it is not so easy to forget , monsieur , that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend , madame de villefort , which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this time , at least , i do not deserve your thanks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - was it ali , asked the count of morcerf ,  - who rescued my son from the hands of bandits? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , count , replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general;  - in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks; but you have already tendered them , and fully discharged your debtif indeed there existed oneand i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> may i beg of you , baroness , to honor me with an introduction to your daughter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you are no strangerat least not by name , replied madame danglars ,  - and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count bowed , while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have a charming young person with you tonight , count , said eugnie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , mademoiselle , said monte cristo , astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what is her name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hayde , replied monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a greek? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured the count of morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , indeed , count , said madame danglars;  - and tell me , did you ever see at the court of ali tepelini , whom you so gloriously and valiantly served , a more exquisite beauty or richer costume? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was inspector - general of the pasha s troops , replied morcerf;  - and it is no secret that i owe my fortune , such as it is , to the liberality of the illustrious albanese chief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed madame danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stammered morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , said monte cristo placing his arms around the count , and leaning with him over the front of the box , just as hayde , whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian , perceived his pale features close to morcerf s face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was as if the young girl beheld the head of medusa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw , then , uttering a faint cry , threw herself back in her seat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , count , exclaimed eugnie ,  - what has happened to your ward? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she seems to have been taken suddenly ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but do not be alarmed on her account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , he bowed to the baroness and her daughter , exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count , and left madame danglars  box . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon his return to hayde he found her still very pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as she saw him she seized his hand; her own hands were moist and icy cold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who was it you were talking with over there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with the count of morcerf , answered monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he tells me he served your illustrious father , and that he owes his fortune to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed hayde , her eyes flashing with rage;  - he sold my father to the turks , and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did not you know that , my dear lord? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - something of this i heard in epirus , said monte cristo;  - but the particulars are still unknown to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you shall relate them to me , my child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , hayde arose , and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral , she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you observe , said the countess g to albert , who had returned to her side ,  - that man does nothing like other people; he listens most devoutly to the third act of robert le diable , and when the fourth begins , takes his departure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some days after this meeting , albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs - lyses , which had already assumed that palace - like appearance which the count s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter , signed  - baronne danglars , ne hermine de servieux . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , madame danglars , not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30 ,000 francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money , had deputed those eyes , by which she was accustomed to see , to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between lucien s visit and the curiosity of the baroness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are in constant communication with the baron danglars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count inquired of albert de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , count , you know what i told you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said monte cristo  - i did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars served together in spain , my father in the army and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars in the commissariat department . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was there that my father , ruined by the revolution , and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , who never had possessed any patrimony , both laid the foundations of their different fortunes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said monte cristo  - i think m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him; and , continued he , casting a side - glance at lucien , who was turning over the leaves of an album ,  - mademoiselle eugnie is prettyi think i remember that to be her name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very pretty , or rather , very beautiful , replied albert ,  - but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate; i am an ungrateful fellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you speak as if you were already her husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , returned albert , in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really , said monte cristo , lowering his voice ,  - you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me , replied morcerf ,  - and that frightens me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bah , exclaimed monte cristo ,  - that s a fine reason to give . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you not rich yourself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my father s income is about 50 ,000 francs per annum; and he will give me , perhaps , ten or twelve thousand when i marry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that , perhaps , might not be considered a large sum , in paris especially , said the count;  - but everything does not depend on wealth , and it is a fine thing to have a good name , and to occupy a high station in society . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your name is celebrated , your position magnificent; and then the comte de morcerf is a soldier , and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin; disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for me , i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one; she will enrich you , and you will ennoble her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said morcerf ,  - this repugnance , if repugnance it may be called , is not all on my side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whence can it arise , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for you told me your father desired the marriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is my mother who dissents; she has a clear and penetrating judgment , and does not smile on the proposed union . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said the count , in a somewhat forced tone ,  - that may be easily explained; the comtesse de morcerf , who is aristocracy and refinement itself , does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth; that is natural enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know if that is her reason , said albert ,  - but one thing i do know , that if this marriage be consummated , it will render her quite miserable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair; but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition<s> <s>  - real? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> interrupted the count , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , real enough , from anxiety doubtless ,at any rate they postponed the matter for two months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not yet twenty - one , and eugnie is only seventeen; but the two months expire next week . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it must be done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how happy you are in being exempt from all this! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , and why should not you be free , too? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - marry her then , said the count , with a significant shrug of the shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied morcerf ,  - but that will plunge my mother into positive grief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then do not marry her , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i shall see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done; you will give me your advice , will you not , and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said he to debray , who had thrown himself into an easy - chair at the farthest extremity of the salon , and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left ,  - what are you doing there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you making a sketch after poussin? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is not his biggest scoop , said morcerf;  - did he not make a million in spaniards this last year? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear fellow , said lucien ,  - here is the count of monte cristo , who will say to you , as the italians do ,<s> <s>  - denaro e santit , met della met . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , haitians ,that is quite another thing! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we may like bouillotte , delight in whist , be enraptured with boston , and yet grow tired of them all; but we always come back to cartit is not only a game , it is a hors - d uvre! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars sold yesterday at 405 , and pockets 300 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had he but waited till today , the price would have fallen to 205 , and instead of gaining 300 ,000 francs , he would have lost 20 or 25 ,000 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am profoundly ignorant of all these stock - jobbing intrigues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because , said albert , laughing ,  - one piece of news follows another , and there is often great dissimilarity between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300 ,000 francs in a day; he must be enormously rich . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not he who plays! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you who are a reasonable being , lucien , and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news , since you are at the fountain - head , surely you ought to prevent it , said morcerf , with a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked lucien;  - you know the character of the baronessno one has any influence with her , and she does precisely what she pleases . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would reform her; it would be rendering a service to her future son - in - law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how would you set about it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a lesson? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news; you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not understand , stammered lucien . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is very clear , notwithstanding , replied the young man , with an artlessness wholly free from affectation;  - tell her some fine morning an unheard - of piece of intelligencesome telegraphic despatch , of which you alone are in possession; for instance , that henri iv . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was seen yesterday at gabrielle s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that would boom the market; she will buy heavily , and she will certainly lose when beauchamp announces the following day , in his gazette , the report circulated by some usually well - informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at gabrielle s house , is totally without foundation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pont - neuf . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> lucien half smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo , although apparently indifferent , had not lost one word of this conversation , and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count , in taking leave of him , said something in a low voice , to which he answered ,  - willingly , count; i accept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count returned to young morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you not think , on reflection , said he to him ,  - that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your mother - in - law in the presence of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear count , said morcerf ,  - i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house , and my mother , has not , i think , visited madame danglars twice in her whole life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said the count ,  - i am emboldened to speak openly to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner , i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting , or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light , especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in that case your mother would hold me in aversion , and i do not at all wish that; on the contrary , i desire to stand high in her esteem . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you say you desire my mother s good opinion; i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i am sure of it; we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to return to what we were saying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if my mother could know of this attention on your partand i will venture to tell heri am sure that she will be most grateful to you; it is true that my father will be equally angry . </s> </s>

<s> <s> go on , baptistin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then to admit no one except major bartolomeo cavalcanti and his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you hearmajor bartolomeo cavalcantia man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of italy , whose name dante has celebrated in the tenth canto of the inferno , you remember it , do you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the major will bring his son with him this evening , the contino , as we say in italy; he confides him to my care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he proves himself worthy of it , i will do what i can to advance his interests . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will assist me in the work , will you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - most undoubtedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this major cavalcanti is an old friend of yours , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by no means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is a perfect nobleman , very polite , modest , and agreeable , such as may be found constantly in italy , descendants of very ancient families . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have met him several times at florence , bologna and lucca , and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris , which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire , when he was on his way to moscow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall give him a good dinner , he will confide his son to my care , i will promise to watch over him , i shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him , and then i shall have done my part . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly; i see you are a model mentor , said albert  - good - bye , we shall return on sunday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the way , i have received news of franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he says you were the sun of rome , and that without you all appears dark and cloudy; i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is a charming young man , said monte cristo  - and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction , when i met him in search of a supper , and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is , i think , the son of general d pinay? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the bonapartists . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> really i like him extremely; is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , he is to marry mademoiselle de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you know i am to marry mademoiselle danglars , said albert , laughing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why do you do so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but really , my dear count , we are talking as much of women as they do of us; it is unpardonable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , count , you are the most polished man in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and your servants , too , how very well behaved they are; there is quite a style about them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore , if you part with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistin , give me the refusal of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is not all; give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese , cavalcante of the cavalcanti; and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son , find him a wife very rich , very noble on her mother s side at least , and a baroness in right of her father , i will help you in the search . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , ha; you will do as much as that , will you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , really , nothing is certain in this world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should like you a hundred times better if , by your intervention , i could manage to remain a bachelor , even were it only for ten years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur bertuccio , you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio slightly started . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title , your excellency , for the tapestried hangings are very old . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio bowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will not touch the garden either; as to the yard , you may do what you please with it; i should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes , your excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really , my dear m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio , said the count ,  - since you have been in paris , you have become quite nervous , and apparently out of your element; you no longer seem to understand me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not yet know myself , neither is it necessary that you should do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lucullus dines with lucullus ,  that is quite sufficient . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio bowed , and left the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> both the count and baptistin had told the truth when they announced to morcerf the proposed visit of the major , which had served monte cristo as a pretext for declining albert s invitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio , according to the command which had been given him , had two hours before left for auteuil , when a cab stopped at the door , and after depositing its occupant at the gate , immediately hurried away , as if ashamed of its employment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wore trousers of blue cloth , boots tolerably clean , but not of the brightest polish , and a little too thick in the soles , buckskin gloves , a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes , and a black cravat striped with white , which , if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will , might have passed for a halter , so much did it resemble one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate , and demanded if it was not at no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the small and angular head of this man , his white hair and thick gray moustaches , caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin , who had received an exact description of the expected visitor , and who was awaiting him in the hall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore , scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was ushered into a simple and elegant drawing - room , and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , my dear sir , you are most welcome; i was expecting you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , said the italian ,  - was your excellency then aware of my visit? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; i had been told that i should see you today at seven o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , so much the better , i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what precaution? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you are sure you are not mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very sure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , never mind that , said the italian;  - it is not worth the trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his visitor appeared slightly uneasy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ex - major in the austrian service? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - was i a major? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said monte cristo  - you were a major; that is the title the french give to the post which you filled in italy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very good , said the major ,  - i do not demand more , you understand<s> <s>  - your visit here today is not of your own suggestion , is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , certainly not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the excellent abb busoni? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exactly so , said the delighted major . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you have a letter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , there it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give it to me , then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and monte cristo took the letter , which he opened and read . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes , and then took a survey of the apartment , but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , i see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - half a million , said he ,  - magnificent! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - half a million , is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , in so many words; and it must be so , for the abb knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be it half a million , then; but on my word of honor , i had no idea that it was so much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must make some reformation in that quarter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who only needs one thing more to make him happy . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - yes , indeed but one! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the major with a sigh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which is to recover a lost and adored son . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - a lost and adored son! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stolen away in his infancy , either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - at the age of five years! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unhappy father , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count continued: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , then , said he ,  - the letter was true to the end? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you doubt it , my dear monsieur bartolomeo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , true , said monte cristo  - there is a postscript . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , repeated the major ,  - yesthereisapostscript . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker , i send him a draft for 2 ,000 francs to defray his travelling expenses , and credit on you for the further sum of 48 ,000 francs , which you still owe me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he said very good ,  muttered the major ,  - thensir replied he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then the postscript<s> <s>  - well; what of the postscript? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly; the abb busoni and myself have a small account open between us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not remember if it is exactly 48 ,000 francs , which i am still owing him , but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you attached great importance , then , to this postscript , my dear monsieur cavalcanti? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must explain to you , said the major ,  - that , fully confiding in the signature of the abb busoni , i had not provided myself with any other funds; so that if this resource had failed me , i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , really i know no one , said the major . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but then you yourself are known to others? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i am known , so that<s> <s>  - proceed , my dear monsieur cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , at your first request . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the major s eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but sit down , said monte cristo;  - really i do not know what i have been thinking ofi have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the major drew an armchair towards him , and proceeded to seat himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said the count ,  - what will you takea glass of sherry , port , or alicante? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have some that is very good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i will take a biscuit , as you are so obliging . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo rang; baptistin appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he in a low voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - into the blue drawing - room , according to your excellency s orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistin left the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really , said the major ,  - i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pray don t mention such a thing , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistin re - entered with glasses , wine , and biscuits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count filled one glass , but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby - colored liquid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the major made a wise choice; he took the full glass and a biscuit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest , who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction , and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , sir , you lived at lucca , did you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you were rich , noble , held in great esteemhad all that could render a man happy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that one thing , your lost child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and sighed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me hear , then , said the count ,  - who this deeply regretted son was; for i always understood you were a bachelor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that was the general opinion , sir , said the major ,  - and i<s> <s>  - yes , replied the count ,  - and you confirmed the report . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a youthful indiscretion , i suppose , which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the major recovered himself , and resumed his usual calm manner , at the same time casting his eyes down , either to give himself time to compose his countenance , or to assist his imagination , all the while giving an under - look at the count , the protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said the major ,  - i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not on your own account , surely , replied monte cristo;  - for a man is above that sort of thing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , certainly not on my own account , said the major with a smile and a shake of the head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but for the sake of the mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , for the mother s sakehis poor mother! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the major , taking a third biscuit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take some more wine , my dear cavalcanti , said the count , pouring out for him a second glass of alicante;  - your emotion has quite overcome you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his poor mother , murmured the major , trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation , so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she belonged to one of the first families in italy , i think , did she not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and her name was<s> <s>  - do you desire to know her name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said monte cristo  - it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me , for i already know it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count knows everything , said the italian , bowing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oliva corsinari , was it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oliva corsinari! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a marchioness! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you married her at last , notwithstanding the opposition of her family? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , that was the way it ended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you have doubtless brought all your papers with you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the register of my child s birth? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the register of the birth of andrea cavalcantiof your son; is not his name andrea? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you believe so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency , i regret to say that , not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers , i neglected to bring them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is unfortunate , returned monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - were they , then , so necessary? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they were indispensable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , perbacco , indispensable , were they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly they were; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , said the major ,  - there might be doubts raised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it would be fatal to his interests . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - o peccato! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  marriage is a civil affair in france , and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see i have not these necessary papers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fortunately , i have them , though , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the major , who , seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers , feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48 ,000 francs - ah , indeed , that is a fortunate circumstance; yes , that really is lucky , for it never occurred to me to bring them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not at all wonder at itone cannot think of everything; but , happily , the abb busoni thought for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is an excellent person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is an admirable man , said the major;  - and he sent them to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here they are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the major clasped his hands in token of admiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del monte - cattini; here is the priest s certificate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes indeed , there it is truly , said the italian , looking on with astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and here is andrea cavalcanti s baptismal register , given by the cur of saravezza . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all quite correct . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take these documents , then; they do not concern me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in that case , replied the major ,  - it would be necessary to write to the cur for duplicates , and it would be some time before they could be obtained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it would be a difficult matter to arrange , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - almost an impossibility , replied the major . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , yes , returned the italian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i knew that , said monte cristo;  - she has been dead these ten years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what would you have? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo;  - we are all mortal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , you understand , my dear monsieur cavalcanti , that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stories of gypsies , who steal children , are not at all in vogue in this part of the world , and would not be believed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces , and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that will be sufficient . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you think so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that an unfaithful tutor , bought over by the enemies of your family<s> <s>  - by the corsinari? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - precisely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have , doubtless , already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the major . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - someone has told you the secret; or , perhaps , you guessed that he was here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that who was here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then he is here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is , said monte cristo;  - when the valet de chambre came in just now , he told me of his arrival . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , very well , very well , said the major , clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear sir , said monte cristo ,  - i understand your emotion; you must have time to recover yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will , in the meantime , go and prepare the young man for this much - desired interview , for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should quite imagine that to be the case , said cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will bring him , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; i do not wish to come between a father and son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your interview will be private . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do not be uneasy; even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent , you cannot well mistake him; he will enter by this door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is a fine young man , of fair complexiona little too fair , perhapspleasing in manners; but you will see and judge for yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the way , said the major ,  - you know i have only the 2 ,000 francs which the abb busoni sent me; this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses , and<s> <s>  - and you want money; that is a matter of course , my dear m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , here are 8 ,000 francs on account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the major s eyes sparkled brilliantly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is 40 ,000 francs which i now owe you , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thought you might want it to show the abb busoni . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , when you receive the remaining 40 ,000 , you shall give me a receipt in full . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , so it is , between perfectly upright people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly; pray do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , said the major , regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have but one portmanteau . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i dare say you have nothing else with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is the use of boring one s self with so many things? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you are a man of foresight and prudence , therefore you sent your luggage on before you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not forget your crosses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said monte cristo ,  - that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement , prepare yourself , my dear m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti , to meet your lost andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> saying which monte cristo bowed , and disappeared behind the tapestry , leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room , which baptistin had designated as the drawing - room , and found there a young man , of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance , who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistin had not found any difficulty in recognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was certainly the tall young man with light hair , red beard , black eyes , and brilliant complexion , whom his master had so particularly described to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa , tapping his boot with the gold - headed cane which he held in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on perceiving the count he rose quickly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count andrea cavalcanti , repeated the young man , accompanying his words with a bow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did not mention that , because the signature seemed to me so strange . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the letter signed sinbad the sailor ,  is it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exactly so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , as i have never known any sinbad , with the exception of the one celebrated in the thousand and one nights<s> <s>  - well , it is one of his descendants , and a great friend of mine; he is a very rich englishman , eccentric almost to insanity , and his real name is lord wilmore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then that explains everything that is extraordinary , said andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is , then , the same englishman whom i metatahyes , indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , monsieur , i am at your service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if what you say be true , replied the count , smiling ,  - perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am ( as you have said ) the count andrea cavalcanti , son of major bartolomeo cavalcanti , a descendant of the cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at florence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since i have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master , i have been constantly seeking him , but all in vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really , all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting , said monte cristo , observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction;  - and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend sinbad; for your father is indeed here , and is seeking you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - most undoubtedly , replied monte cristo;  - your father , major bartolomeo cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the expression of terror which , for the moment , had overspread the features of the young man , had now disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> major bartolomeo cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and you really mean to say; monsieur , that my dear father is here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir; and i can even add that i have only just left his company . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your father did not hesitate an instant , and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont , with a passport signed for italy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you were in the south of france , i think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied andrea , with an embarrassed air ,  - i was in the south of france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - precisely so; and it conveyed me from nice to genoa , from genoa to turin , from turin to chambry , from chambry to pont - de - beauvoisin , and from pont - de - beauvoisin to paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said andrea ,  - if my father had met me , i doubt if he would have recognized me; i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , the voice of nature , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the young man , quite astounded ,  - i hope no false report<s> <s>  - as for myself , i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore , the philanthropist . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - sir , returned the young man , with a reassurance of manner ,  - make your mind easy on this score . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those who took me from my father , and who always intended , sooner or later , to sell me again to my original proprietor , as they have now done , calculated that , in order to make the most of their bargain , it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth , and even to increase the value , if possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have , therefore , received a very good education , and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor , whose masters made them grammarians , doctors , and philosophers , in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you , my dear count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world , and be deemed unlikely and unnatural . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you might excite a little curiosity , but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i agree with you , monsieur , said the young man , turning pale , and , in spite of himself , trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion ,  - such consequences would be extremely unpleasant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nevertheless , you must not exaggerate the evil , said monte cristo ,  - for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct , and for a man of your intelligence , this plan is as easy as it is necessary; you must form honorable friendships , and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea visibly changed countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser , said monte cristo ,  - did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends , and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too; therefore , in departing from this rule , i should ( as the actors say ) be playing a part quite out of my line , and should , therefore , run the risk of being hissed , which would be an act of folly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - however , your excellency , said andrea ,  - in consideration of lord wilmore , by whom i was recommended to you<s> <s>  - yes , certainly , interrupted monte cristo;  - but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me , my dear m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea , that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , said the count , watching andrea s countenance ,  - i do not demand any confession from you; it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are not generally very severe with the austrians . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , sir , you have given me confidence; it is so long since we were separated , that i have not the least remembrance of him , and , besides , you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - then in that case i shall always choose to remain there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you cannot control circumstances , my dear sir; man proposes , and god disposes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said he ,  - so long as i do remain in paris , and nothing forces me to quit it , do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall i receive it from my father? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked andrea , with some uneasiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , you will receive it from your father personally , but lord wilmore will be the security for the money . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - will you not embrace me , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you wish it , my son , said the major; and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage; that is to say , each rested his head on the other s shoulder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then we are once more reunited? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - once more , replied the major . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , as to thati think , my dear son , you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - as for me , you must know i cannot possibly live out of lucca; therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but before you leave france , my dear father , i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly; i am come expressly on that account; it has cost me much trouble to find you , but i had resolved on giving them into your hands , and if i had to recommence my search , it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea seized the certificate of his father s marriage and his own baptismal register , and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances , he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents , and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had perused the documents , an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance , and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile , he said , in very excellent tuscan: </s> </s>

<s> <s> the major drew himself up to his full height . </s> </s>

<s> <s> in france , my dear sir , half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five years , for change of air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you be good enough to explain your meaning? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti , said andrea , taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner ,  - how much are you paid for being my father? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - make yourself easy , we are quite alone , said andrea;  - besides , we are conversing in italian . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i used not to do so , but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - whom do you mean by they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi , i can hardly tell , but i was alluding to those who wrote the letter; you received one , did you not? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - about half - past six . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we will be with you at that time , said the major . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two cavalcanti bowed to the count , and left the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo went to the window , and saw them crossing the street , arm in arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there go two miscreants; said he ,  - it is a pity they are not really related! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , after an instant of gloomy reflection ,  - come , i will go to see the morrels , said he;  - i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort s house , and , behind the gate , half screened from view by the large chestnut - trees , which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches , we shall find some people of our acquaintance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time maximilian was the first to arrive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees , and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian , she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden , being anxious to show that the delay , which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him , was not occasioned by any neglect on her part . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man , with the intuitive perception of a lover , quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed , and he was comforted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , although she avoided coming within speaking distance , valentine arranged so that maximilian could see her pass and repass , and each time she went by , she managed , unperceived by her companion , to cast an expressive look at the young man , which seemed to say ,  - have patience! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see it is not my fault . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is unnecessary to state that , in the eyes of the young man , valentine did not suffer by the contrast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a few minutes valentine re - entered the garden alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for fear that anyone should be observing her return , she walked slowly; and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate , she seated herself on a bench , and , carefully casting her eyes around , to convince herself that she was not watched , she presently arose , and proceeded quickly to join maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - evening , valentine , said a well - known voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - evening , maximilian; i know i have kept you waiting , but you saw the cause of my delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was not aware that you were so intimate with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who told you we were intimate , maximilian? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no one , but you appeared to be so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the manner in which you walked and talked together , one would have thought you were two school - girls telling your secrets to each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we were having a confidential conversation , returned valentine;  - she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dear valentine! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and eugnie , as in speaking of the man whom i could not love , my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , how good you are to say so , valentine! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit , for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , valentine , i assure you such is not the case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden , and , on my honor , without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars , i cannot understand how any man can really love her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the fact is , maximilian , that i was there , and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if we are so , it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but return to your question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - does mademoiselle danglars object to this marriage with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf on account of loving another? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with eugnie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate; own , now , that you did question her on the subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , i see you are smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you are already aware of the conversation that passed , the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , what did she say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she told me that she loved no one , said valentine;  - that she disliked the idea of being married; that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life; and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune , that she might become an artist , like her friend , mademoiselle louise d armilly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing , replied maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you want me to go away? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , no , no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do not let us lose time; you are the subject on which i wish to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , we must be quick , for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said maximilian , in consternation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , you are right; i am but a poor friend to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a life i cause you to lead , poor maximilian , you who are formed for happiness! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i bitterly reproach myself , i assure you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , what does it signify , valentine , so long as i am satisfied , and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society , or two words from your lips? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts , harmonizing as ours do , and almost miraculously brought us together , to separate us at last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must hope for us both , maximilian; that will make me at least partly happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know particulars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can only tell you that madame de villefort sent to request my presence , as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let them take my fortune , i am already too rich; and , perhaps , when they have taken it , they will leave me in peace and quietness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i shall always love you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what should i care for either riches or poverty , if my valentine was near me , and i felt certain that no one could deprive me of her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not think that is the case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - however it may be , valentine , you must not be alarmed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am a brute . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i was going to tell you that i met m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf the other day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur franz is his friend , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur de morcerf has received a letter from franz , announcing his immediate return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine turned pale , and leaned her hand against the gate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but no , the communication would not come through madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - becausei scarcely know whybut it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage , although she did not choose openly to oppose it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not be in such a hurry to do that , said valentine , with a sad smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay , she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , maximilian , it is not suitors to which madame de villefort objects , it is marriage itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you do not understand me , maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about a year ago , i talked of retiring to a convent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can form no idea of the expression of that old man s eye when he looks at me , the only person in the world whom he loves , and , i had almost said , by whom he is beloved in return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he learned my resolution , i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me , and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , maximilian , i experienced , at that moment , such remorse for my intention , that , throwing myself at his feet , i exclaimed ,forgive me , pray forgive me , my dear grandfather; they may do what they will with me , i will never leave you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  when i had ceased speaking , he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven , but without uttering a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did i not tell you just now that i was rich , maximiliantoo rich? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i possess nearly 50 ,000 livres in right of my mother; my grandfather and my grandmother , the marquis and marquise de saint - mran , will leave me as much , and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier evidently intends making me his heir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my brother edward , who inherits nothing from his mother , will , therefore , be poor in comparison with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not for herself that she is so , but for her son , and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but could you not compromise matters , and give up a portion of your fortune to her son? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how could i make such a proposition , especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - valentine , i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred; consequently , i have covered it with the veil of respect , and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine , will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love i bear you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a friend , maximilian; and who is this friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend , though , in reality , it was the first time you had ever met? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - extraordinary , did you say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have known him for some time , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - scarcely longer than eight or ten days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , maximilian , i had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your logic is most powerful , valentine , but say what you will , i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me , and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come , and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he must be a prophet , then , said valentine , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , said maximilian ,  - i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy; at all events , he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said valentine in a mournful tone ,  - do let me see this man , maximilian; he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my poor girl , you know him already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; it was he who saved the life of your step - mother and her son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count of monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , cried valentine ,  - he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it is not just that he should despise me so , without any reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , forgive me , said valentine , perceiving the effect which her words were producing on maximilian:  - i have done wrong , for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart . </s> </s>

<s> <s> my father , who never goes out , has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation; madame de villefort , on the contrary , is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house , therefore , she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , no; it is as i have said , maximilian ,there is no one in the world of whom i can ask help but yourself and my grandfather , who is little better than a corpseno support to cling to but my mother in heaven! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - so much the worse , said valentine , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations , for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left , in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side , while it left me unharmed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dear maximilian , why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - well , look through this opening , and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried valentine;  - why did you not bring him close to the gate , so that i could talk to him and pat him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is , as you see , a very valuable animal , said maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , i went to a horse dealer s , where i saw this magnificent horse , which i have named mdah . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i immediately put on the saddle and bridle , to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible; then , putting the 4 ,500 francs into the hands of the astonished dealer , i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champs - lyses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as i rode by the count s house i perceived a light in one of the windows , and fancied i saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear maximilian , you are really too fanciful; you will not love even me long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common , every - day sort of attachment such as ours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but they are calling me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you hear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - maximilian , we said we would be to each other as two voices , two shadows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as you will , valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall you be happy if i do what you wish? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian uttered a cry of delight , and , springing forwards , seized the hand extended towards him , and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little hand was then immediately withdrawn , and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house , as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort entered his father s room , followed by madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> both of the visitors , after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois , a faithful servant , who had been twenty - five years in his service , took their places on either side of the paralytic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier was sitting in an armchair , which moved upon casters , in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning , and in the same way drawn out again at night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was placed before a large glass , which reflected the whole apartment , and so , without any attempt to move , which would have been impossible , he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sight and hearing were the only senses remaining , and they , like two solitary sparks , remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave; it was only , however , by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind , and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place , and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he commanded with it; it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes , and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs , while the rest of the rigid and marble - like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic; these were villefort , valentine , and the old servant of whom we have already spoken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine had solved the problem , and was able easily to understand his thoughts , and to convey her own in return , and , through her untiring and devoted assiduity , it was seldom that , in the ordinary transactions of every - day life , she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living , thinking mind , or the wants of the almost inanimate body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to the servant , he had , as we have said , been with his master for five - and - twenty years , therefore he knew all his habits , and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything , so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as we have said , he perfectly understood the old man s vocabulary , and if he did not use it more often , it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden , sent away barrois , and after having seated himself at his father s right hand , while madame de villefort placed herself on the left , he addressed him thus: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble , while , on the contrary , villefort s eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man s heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind; he listened , nothing more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , resumed villefort ,  - we are thinking of marrying valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had the old man s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the marriage will take place in less than three months , said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we thought this news would possess an interest for you , sir , who have always entertained a great affection for valentine; it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed; he possesses fortune , a high rank in society , and every personal qualification likely to render valentine supremely happy ,his name , moreover , cannot be wholly unknown to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz de quesnel , baron d pinay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz , the pupil of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s eye began to dilate , and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak , and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the procureur , who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said he ,  - you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year , which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s look was furious; it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man s mind , for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat , and not being able to find vent in utterance , appeared almost to choke him , for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort quietly opened a window , saying ,  - it is very warm , and the heat affects m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then returned to his place , but did not sit down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this marriage , added madame de villefort ,  - is quite agreeable to the wishes of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay and his family; besides , he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt , his mother having died at his birth , and his father having been assassinated in 1815 , that is to say , when he was but two years old; it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits , and he has , therefore , seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , continued villefort ,  - those to whom the guilt really belongs , by whom the crime was committed , on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here , and the certain judgment of god hereafter , would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace - offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then motioned to his wife to take leave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now sir , said madame de villefort ,  - i must bid you farewell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would you like me to send edward to you for a short time? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he wanted valentine , he closed his right eye only , and if barrois , the left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at madame de villefort s proposition he instantly winked his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> provoked by a complete refusal , she bit her lip and said ,  - then shall i send valentine to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man closed his eyes eagerly , thereby intimating that such was his wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and madame de villefort bowed and left the room , giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfather s presence , and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine , with a color still heightened by emotion , entered the room just after her parents had quitted it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering , and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have vexed you , and you are angry? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who has displeased you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it my father? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame de villefort? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the former sign was repeated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you displeased with me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried valentine in astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier again closed his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what have i done , dear grandpapa , that you should be angry with me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no answer , and she continued: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have not seen you all day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has anyone been speaking to you against me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said the old man s look , with eagerness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me think a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do assure you , grandpapaahm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> may i go and ask them , that i may have the opportunity of making my peace with you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , you frighten me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what can they have said? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she again tried to think what it could be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they have been speaking of my marriage ,have they not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the angry look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i understand; you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the reason of it was , that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret , and begged me not to tell you anything of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did not even acquaint me with their intentions , and i only discovered them by chance , that is why i have been so reserved with you , dear grandpapa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray forgive me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but there was no look calculated to reassure her; all it seemed to say was ,  - it is not only your reserve which afflicts me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the young girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps you think i shall abandon you , dear grandpapa , and that i shall forget you when i am married? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay consented to our all living together? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then why are you still vexed and grieved? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man s eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - and you are afraid i shall be unhappy? </s> </s>

<s> <s> franz? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eyes repeated several times ,  - no , no , no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , listen , said valentine , throwing herself on her knees , and putting her arm round her grandfather s neck ,  - i am vexed , too , for i do not love m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz d pinay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an expression of intense joy illumined the old man s eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when i wished to retire into a convent , you remember how angry you were with me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s breathing came thick and short . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , if you could but help meif we could both together defeat their plan! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think you can help me , dear grandpapa? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier raised his eyes , it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said valentine , and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind , she repeated them aloud , then ,finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant  - no ,she said ,  - come , since this plan does not answer , i will have recourse to another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said valentine ,  - the thing you desire begins with the letter n; it is with n that we have to do , then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , let me see , what can you want that begins with n? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine fetched a dictionary , which she placed on a desk before noirtier; she opened it , and , seeing that the old man s eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages , she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state , valentine s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes , and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the word notary , noirtier made a sign to her to stop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall my father be informed of your wish? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine rang the bell , and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you satisfied now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired valentine . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - sir , said valentine ,  - my grandfather wishes for a notary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this strange and unexpected demand m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , motioned the latter , with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant , who both knew what his wishes were , he was quite prepared to maintain the contest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you wish for a notary? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you want with a notary? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - still , said barrois , with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant ,  - if m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you shall have a notary , as you absolutely wish for one , sir , said villefort;  - but i shall explain to him your state of health , and make excuses for you , for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never mind that , said barrois;  - i shall go and fetch a notary , nevertheless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl perfectly understood the look , and so did villefort , for his countenance became clouded , and he knitted his eyebrows angrily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took a seat , and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference , at the same time giving a side look at valentine , which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three - quarters of an hour after , barrois returned , bringing the notary with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said villefort , after the first salutations were over ,  - you were sent for by m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , whom you see here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all his limbs have become completely paralysed , he has lost his voice also , and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine , which look was at once so earnest and imperative , that she answered immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is quite true , said barrois;  - and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - permit me , said the notary , turning first to villefort and then to valentine - permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first thing necessary to render an act valid is , that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the notary then prepared to retire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief , that she arrested the departure of the notary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said she ,  - the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt , and i can teach you in a few minutes , to understand it almost as well as i can myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you tell me what you require , in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed , but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , sir , by the help of two signs , with which i will acquaint you presently , you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , being deprived of voice and motion , is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes ,  and to wink when he means no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier;try . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying , sir , have you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the notary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier closed his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you approve of what she saidthat is to say , you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was you who sent for me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to make your will? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man winked violently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , sir , said the young girl ,  - do you understand now , and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but before the notary could answer , villefort had drawn him aside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said he ,  - do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock , such as m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must see that to be an utter impossibility , said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine and the old man heard this conversation , and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said she ,  - that need not make you uneasy , however difficult it may at first sight appear to be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can discover and explain to you my grandfather s thoughts , so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , sir , what do you require of me , and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , said the procureur ,  - and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary , for i cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine , and she may , perhaps , be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill - defined wishes of her grandfather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said the notary , whose interest had been greatly excited , and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene ,  - what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago , has now become quite easy and practicable , and this may be a perfectly valid will , provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses , approved by the testator , and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to the details , the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator , and by yourself , who , having had the management of them , can doubtless give full information on the subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continued the notary , addressing the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is he going to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the procureur then told his wife to come up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also arrived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they read to noirtier the formal copy of a will , in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched; then , in order to test the capacity of the testator , the first notary said , turning towards him: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when an individual makes his will , it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation; you will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your fortune exceeds 300 ,000 francs , does it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier made a sign that it did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you possess 400 ,000 francs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the notary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s eye remained immovable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - 500 ,000? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same expression continued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - 600 ,000700 ,000800 ,000900 ,000? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier stopped him at the last - named sum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are then in possession of 900 ,000 francs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in stock? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the stock is in your own hands? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old servant left the room , and presently returned , bringing with him a small casket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you permit us to open this casket? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the notary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they opened it , and found 900 ,000 francs in bank scrip . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first notary handed over each note , as he examined it , to his colleague . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier had stated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is all as he has said; it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , turning towards the paralytic , he said ,  - you possess , then , 900 ,000 francs of capital , which , according to the manner in which you have invested it , ought to bring in an income of about 40 ,000 livres? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to whom do you desire to leave this fortune? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter , mademoiselle de villefort; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years , and has , by her devoted attention , fully secured the affection , i had almost said the gratitude , of her grandfather , and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it , then , to mademoiselle valentine de villefort that you leave these 900 ,000 francs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded the notary , thinking he had only to insert this clause , but waiting first for the assent of noirtier , which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine , when her name was made the subject of discussion , had stepped back , to escape unpleasant observation; her eyes were cast down , and she was crying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are not making any mistake , are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief , but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , grandpapa , i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me; you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes , most assuredly , said the eyes of the paralytic , for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , thank you , murmured she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man s declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort; she gradually approached the invalid , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson , edward de villefort? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what have we all done , then , dear grandpapa? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said valentine;  - you no longer seem to love any of us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said she;  - if you love me , grandpapa , try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune; besides , they say i am already rich in right of my mothertoo rich , even . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> explain yourself , then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on valentine s hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - her hand! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed everyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , gentlemen , you see it is all useless , and that my father s mind is really impaired , said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , cried valentine suddenly ,  - i understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is my marriage you mean , is it not , dear grandpapa? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , yes , signed the paralytic , casting on valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are angry with us all on account of this marriage , are you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really , this is too absurd , said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excuse me , sir , replied the notary;  - on the contrary , the meaning of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you do not wish me to marry m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz d pinay? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> observed valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not wish it , said the eye of her grandfather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a profound silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude , and villefort was biting his lips with vexation , while madame de villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy , which , in spite of herself , appeared in her whole countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter s hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is my wish that she should marry m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man gave no answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in favor of some member of your family? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier made no answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but they will contest the will after your death? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the notary of villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing , sir; it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am quite resigned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these 900 ,000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital; but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man , and i shall , therefore , act according to my conscience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having said this , villefort quitted the room with his wife , leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same day the will was made , the witnesses were brought , it was approved by the old man , sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> deschamps , the family notary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo , who had come to visit them in their absence , had been ushered into the drawing - room , and was still awaiting them there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort , who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately , retired to her bedroom , while the procureur , who could better depend upon himself , proceeded at once to the salon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort flattered himself that , to all outward view , he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind , he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow , so much so that the count , whose smile was radiant , immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo , after the first compliments were over ,  - what is the matter with you , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort tried to smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is i who lose my cause , and it is ill - luck , obstinacy , and folly which have caused it to be decided against me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo with well - feigned interest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , said monte cristo ,  - the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess , and to one of your philosophic spirit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me , said villefort ,  - though , after all , 900 ,000 francs are worth regretting; but i am the more annoyed with this fate , chance , or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune , and may blast the prospects of my child also , as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my father , as i told you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed , and that all his faculties were completely destroyed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , his bodily faculties , for he can neither move nor speak , nevertheless he thinks , acts , and wills in the manner i have described . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i left him about five minutes ago , and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but to do this he must have spoken? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has done better than thathe has made himself understood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how was such a thing possible? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - morning , madame , said the count , bowing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded monte cristo  - and what incomprehensible misfortune<s> <s>  - incomprehensible is the word! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> interrupted the procureur , shrugging his shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is an old man s caprice! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and is there no means of making him revoke his decision? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said madame de villefort;  - and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will , which is now in prejudice of valentine , to be altered in her favor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count , who perceived that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear , said villefort , in answer to his wife ,  - you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family , nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think , said madame de villefort ,  - that valentine is in league with him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she has always been opposed to this marriage , and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame , said villefort ,  - believe me , a fortune of 900 ,000 francs is not so easily renounced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she could , nevertheless , make up her mind to renounce the world , sir , since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - notwithstanding your father s wishes to the contrary? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said madame de villefort , selecting a new point of attack . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is a serious thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo , who pretended not to be listening , heard however , every word that was said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame , replied villefort  - i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father , because , to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the name of father is sacred in two senses; he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , under the present circumstances , i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who , because he hated the father , vents his anger on the son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier; i will suffer , without complaint , the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me; but i shall remain firm in my determination , and the world shall see which party has reason on his side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count , the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solicited during this speech . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you say that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , that is the reason , said villefort , shrugging his shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the apparent reason , at least , said madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i want to know in what way m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay can have displeased your father more than any other person? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz d pinay , said the count;  - is he not the son of general de quesnel , who was created baron d pinay by charles x . </s> </s> 
? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the same , said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is , which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in their affection , said madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , ma foi! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who is to know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps it is some political difference? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - was not your father a bonapartist? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monte cristo;  - i think i remember that you told me something of that kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my father has been a jacobin more than anything else , said villefort , carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence;  - and the senator s robe , which napoleon cast on his shoulders , only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier possessed this peculiarity , he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized , but strove for possibilities , and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain ,theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said monte cristo ,  - it is just as i thought; it was politics which brought noirtier and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay into personal contact . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - am i mistaken , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir , the facts were precisely what you have stated , said madame de villefort;  - and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he will , perhaps , hold me in greater esteem than the money itself , seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , he knows that valentine is rich in right of her mother , and that she will , in all probability , inherit the fortune of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and madame de saint - mran , her mother s parents , who both love her tenderly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , said madame de villefort;  - besides , they are to come to paris in about a month , and valentine , after the affront she has received , need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but it seems to me , said monte cristo ,  - and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say , that if m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested , he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor edward is as much m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s grandchild as valentine , and yet , if she had not been going to marry m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier would have left her all his money; and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather , she will still be three times richer than he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count listened and said no more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , said villefort ,  - we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions , and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so , but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a man of sense and feeling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay , to whom i had promised the interest of this sum , shall receive it , even if i endure the most cruel privations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay , in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , that would be a great pity , said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a great pity , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - undoubtedly , said villefort , moderating the tones of his voice ,  - a marriage once concerted and then broken off , throws a sort of discredit on a young lady; then again , the old reports , which i was so anxious to put an end to , will instantly gain ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , it will all go well; m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay , if he is an honorable man , will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort , unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice , but that is impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i agree with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , said monte cristo , fixing his eyes on madame de villefort;  - and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice , i would persuade him , since i have been told m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay is coming back , to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the procureur arose , delighted with the proposition , but his wife slightly changed color . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , that is all that i wanted , and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are , said he , extending his hand to monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened , and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay , even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry , which he will not do , would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you going to leave us , count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and , said villefort ,  - is it at your house in the champs - lyses that you receive your visitors? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said monte cristo ,  - which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritorious ,it is in the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the country? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where is it , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> near paris , is it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very near , only half a league from the barriers ,it is at auteuil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at auteuil? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said villefort;  - true , madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil , since it was to your house that she was taken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and in what part of auteuil do you reside? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - rue de la fontaine! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed villefort in an agitated tone;  - at what number? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 28 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , cried villefort ,  - was it you who bought m . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i think it charming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , for which i am quite at a loss to account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not like auteuil , sir , said the procureur , making an evident effort to appear calm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company , sir , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , count ,i hopei assure you i shall do my best , stammered villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said monte cristo ,  - i allow of no excuse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on saturday , at six o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall be expecting you , and if you fail to come , i shall thinkfor how do i know to the contrary? that this house , which has remained uninhabited for twenty years , must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , said monte cristo;  - now you must permit me to take my leave of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hours together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a telegraph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , a telegraph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock , and in the light of the sun its black arms , bending in every direction , always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle , and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it , for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity , and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i began to think of genii , sylphs , gnomes , in short , of all the ministers of the occult sciences , until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch , hired for twelve hundred francs a year , and employed all day , not in studying the heavens like an astronomer , or in gazing on the water like an angler , or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him , but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white - bellied , black - clawed fellow insect , four or five leagues distant from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length i felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely , and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect - actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and are you going there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what telegraph do you intend visiting? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that of the home department , or of the observatory? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no; i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant , and who would try to explain to me , in spite of myself , a mystery which even they do not understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ma foi! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are a singular man , said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what line would you advise me to study? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the one that is most in use just at this time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the spanish one , you mean , i suppose? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me; it will be nothing more than a sign from m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> duchtel , or from m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> montalivet , transmitted to the prefect of bayonne , mystified by two greek words , tle , graphein . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is the insect with black claws , and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go then; for in the course of two hours it will be dark , and you will not be able to see anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you frighten me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> which is the nearest way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the tower of montlhry , you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the door the count was met by the two notaries , who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine , and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leaving the village of linas , without stopping at the telegraph , which flourished its great bony arms as he passed , the count reached the tower of montlhry , situated , as everyone knows , upon the highest point of the plain of that name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path , about eighteen inches wide; when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge , upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure , and was not long in finding a little wooden gate , working on willow hinges , and fastened with a nail and string . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count soon mastered the mechanism , the gate opened , and he then found himself in a little garden , about twenty feet long by twelve wide , bounded on one side by part of the hedge , which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate , and on the other by the old tower , covered with ivy and studded with wall - flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one would have thought in looking at this old , weather - beaten , floral - decked tower ( which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast ) that it would have been capable of telling strange things , if ,in addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with ,it had also a voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel , edged by a border of thick box , of many years  growth , and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of delacroix , our modern rubens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden; the earth , black as soot , the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence; besides , had natural humidity been wanting , it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means , thanks to a tank of water , sunk in one of the corners of the garden , and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad , who , from antipathy , no doubt , always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths , or a weed in the flower - beds; no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums , her cacti , and her rhododendrons , in her porcelain jardinire with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail , and cast a look around . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the man at the telegraph , said he ,  - must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves; the something rose , uttering an exclamation of astonishment , and monte cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old , who was plucking strawberries , which he was placing upon grape leaves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries , which , on rising suddenly , he let fall from his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are gathering your crop , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excuse me , sir , replied the man , raising his hand to his cap;  - i am not up there , i know , but i have only just come down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have ten left , said the man ,  - for here are eleven , and i had twenty - one , five more than last year . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this is the reason that , instead of the sixteen i had last year , i have this year , you see , eleven , already pluckedtwelve , thirteen , fourteen , fifteen , sixteen , seventeen , eighteen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , i miss three , they were here last night , siri am sure they were herei counted them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it must be the son of mre simon who has stolen them; i saw him strolling about here this morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course , said the gardener ,  - but that does not make it the less unpleasant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , sir , once more i beg pardon; perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , my time is not valuable , replied the man with a melancholy smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - still it belongs to government , and i ought not to waste it; but , having received the signal that i might rest for an hour ( here he glanced at the sun - dial , for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhry , even a sun - dial ) ,  - and having ten minutes before me , and my strawberries being ripe , when a day longerby - the - by , sir , do you think dormice eat them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , i should think not , replied monte cristo;  - dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved , as the romans did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did the romans eat them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have read so in petronius , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they can t be nice , though they do say as fat as a dormouse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  it is not a wonder they are fat , sleeping all day , and only waking to eat all night . </s> </s>

<s> <s> every man has a devouring passion in his heart , as every fruit has its worm; that of the telegraph man was horticulture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he began gathering the grape - leaves which screened the sun from the grapes , and won the heart of the gardener . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you come here , sir , to see the telegraph? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have been told , said the count ,  - that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why do you like that best? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because then i have no responsibility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am a machine then , and nothing else , and so long as i work , nothing more is required of me . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - all you were showing me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and you really understand none of these signals? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - none at all . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you are fond of gardening? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - badly enough; but yet i do live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but you have a wretchedly small garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , the garden is not large . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and , then , such as it is , it is filled with dormice , who eat everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , they are my scourges . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me , should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your right - hand correspondent was telegraphing<s> <s>  - i should not see him . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - sir , let me see my right - hand correspondent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bank - notes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exactly; there are fifteen of them . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - now this is not all , he said;  - you cannot live upon your fifteen thousand francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , you will lose it , for you are going to alter your correspondent s message . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , sir , what are you proposing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , unless you force me<s> <s>  - i think i can effectually force you; and monte cristo drew another packet from his pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here are ten thousand more francs , he said ,  - with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket , they will make twenty - five thousand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a garden with two acres of land! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and a thousand francs a year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing very difficult . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo took a paper from his pocket , upon which were drawn three signs , with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , you see it will not take long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but<s> <s>  - do this , and you will have nectarines and all the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the shot told; red with fever , while the large drops fell from his brow , the man executed , one after the other , the three signs given by the count , in spite of the frightful contortions of the right - hand correspondent , who , not understanding the change , began to think the gardener had gone mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to the left - hand one , he conscientiously repeated the same signals , which were finally transmitted to the minister of the interior . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now you are rich , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the man ,  - but at what a price! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , friend , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not wish to cause you any remorse; believe me , then , when i swear to you that you have wronged no man , but on the contrary have benefited mankind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man looked at the bank - notes , felt them , counted them , turned pale , then red , then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water , but he had no time to reach the water - jug , and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think so , indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has six millions  worth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because don carlos has fled from bourges , and has returned to spain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how do you know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray shrugged his shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the baroness did not wait for a repetition; she ran to her husband , who immediately hastened to his agent , and ordered him to sell at any price . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when it was seen that danglars sold , the spanish funds fell directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars lost five hundred thousand francs; but he rid himself of all his spanish shares . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - [by telegraph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> barcelona has risen in his favor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of danglars , who had sold his shares , and of the luck of the stock - jobber , who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those who had kept their shares , or bought those of danglars , looked upon themselves as ruined , and passed a very bad night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> next morning le moniteur contained the following: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the king ( don carlos ) has not left bourges , and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , reckoning his loss , and what he had missed gaining , made the difference of a million to danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good , said monte cristo to morrel , who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which danglars had been the victim ,  - i have just made a discovery for twenty - five thousand francs , for which i would have paid a hundred thousand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at first sight , the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no indications of splendor , nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent count of monte cristo; but this simplicity was according to the will of its master , who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the splendor was within . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , almost before the door opened , the scene changed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing , and in the rapidity with which it was executed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>; in three days m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars , large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house , and in the foreground , instead of the usual paving - stones , half hidden by the grass , there extended a lawn but that morning laid down , and upon which the water was yet glistening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the rest , the orders had been issued by the count; he himself had given a plan to bertuccio , marking the spot where each tree was to be planted , and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving - stones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus the house had become unrecognizable , and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it , encircled as it was by a framework of trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the overseer would not have objected , while he was about it , to have made some improvements in the garden , but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio made amends , however , by loading the antechambers , staircases , and mantle - pieces with flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what , above all , manifested the shrewdness of the steward , and the profound science of the master , the one in carrying out the ideas of the other , was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy , impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time , had in a single day acquired the aspect of life , was scented with its master s favorite perfumes , and had the very light regulated according to his wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the count arrived , he had under his touch his books and arms , his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures; his dogs , whose caresses he loved , welcomed him in the antechamber; the birds , whose songs delighted him , cheered him with their music; and the house , awakened from its long sleep , like the sleeping beauty in the wood , lived , sang , and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished , and in which , when we are forced to leave them , we leave a part of our souls . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard; some , belonging to the kitchens , gliding down the stairs , restored but the previous day , as if they had always inhabited the house; others filling the coach - houses , where the equipages , encased and numbered , appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years; and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms , who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at five o clock precisely , the count arrived before the house at auteuil , followed by ali . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience , mingled with uneasiness; he hoped for some compliments , while , at the same time , he feared to have frowns . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo descended into the courtyard , walked all over the house , without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure , until he entered his bedroom , situated on the opposite side to the closed room; then he approached a little piece of furniture , made of rosewood , which he had noticed at a previous visit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that can only be to hold gloves , he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the delighted bertuccio ,  - and you will find gloves in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> elsewhere the count found everything he requiredsmelling - bottles , cigars , knick - knacks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at precisely six o clock the clatter of horses  hoofs was heard at the entrance door; it was our captain of spahis , who had arrived on mdah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sure i am the first , cried morrel;  - i did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself , before everyone came . </s> </s>

<s> <s> if you had seen at what a pace he camelike the wind! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should think so ,a horse that cost 5 ,000 francs! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo , in the tone which a father would use towards a son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you regret them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel , with his open laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> certainly not , replied the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , who both mount the minister s arabians; and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars , who always go at six leagues an hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then they follow you? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - see , they are here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carriage drove round , and stopped at the steps , followed by the horsemen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but nothing escaped the count s notice , and he observed a little note , passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice , from the hand of madame danglars to that of the minister s secretary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after his wife the banker descended , as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo , around the courtyard , over the peristyle , and across the front of the house , then , repressing a slight emotion , which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color , she ascended the steps , saying to morrel: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , if you were a friend of mine , i should ask you if you would sell your horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace , and then turned round to monte cristo , as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named , he would not only lose his bet , but people would say he was afraid; and a brave captain of spahis cannot risk this , even to gratify a pretty woman , which is , in my opinion , one of the most sacred obligations in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see my position , madame , said morrel , bestowing a grateful smile on monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems to me , said danglars , in his coarse tone , ill - concealed by a forced smile ,  - that you have already got horses enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo smiled at her unusual humility , and showed her two immense porcelain jars , over which wound marine plants , of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , said she ,  - you could plant one of the chestnut - trees in the tuileries inside! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can such enormous jars have been manufactured? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame , replied monte cristo ,  - you must not ask of us , the manufacturers of fine porcelain , such a question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is the work of another age , constructed by the genii of earth and water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how so? at what period can that have been? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know; i have only heard that an emperor of china had an oven built expressly , and that in this oven twelve jars like this were successively baked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of two hundred years the documents were found , and they thought of bringing up the jars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am fond of these jars , upon which , perhaps , misshapen , frightful monsters have fixed their cold , dull eyes , and in which myriads of small fish have slept , seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile , danglars , who had cared little for curiosities , was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange - tree , one after another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had finished with the orange - tree , he began at the cactus; but this , not being so easily plucked as the orange - tree , pricked him dreadfully . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - waiting for whom? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio , without answering , pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , oh! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - him! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - really , i think you are going mad , good bertuccio , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then he is not dead? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs , as your countrymen do , you must have struck higher or lower , and life is very tenacious in these lawyers , or rather there is no truth in anything you have told meit was a fright of the imagination , a dream of your fancy . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , he said ,  - will you conduct the baroness danglars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort complied , and they passed on to the dining - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house , and yet astonished , even uneasy though they were , they still felt that they would not like to be absent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the recent events , the solitary and eccentric position of the count , his enormous , nay , almost incredible fortune , should have made men cautious , and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them; and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and all present , even including cavalcanti and his son , notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other , were thoughtful , on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars had started when villefort , on the count s invitation , offered his arm; and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles , when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars , on his left morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars; the other seats were filled by debray , who was placed between the two cavalcanti , and by chteau - renaud , seated between madame de villefort and morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the repast was magnificent; monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas , and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rare birds , retaining their most brilliant plumage , enormous fish , spread upon massive silver dishes , together with every wine produced in the archipelago , asia minor , or the cape , sparkling in bottles , whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught ,all these , like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests , passed in review before the eyes of the astonished parisians , who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons , but only on the condition of eating pearls , like cleopatra , or drinking refined gold , like lorenzo de  medici . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo noticed the general astonishment , and began laughing and joking about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentlemen , he said ,  - you will admit that , when arrived at a certain degree of fortune , the superfluities of life are all that can be desired; and the ladies will allow that , after having risen to a certain eminence of position , the ideal alone can be more exalted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i gratify my wishes by two meansmy will and my money . </s> </s>

<s> <s> debray , in pacifying a kingdom; you , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de chteau - renaud , in pleasing a woman; and you , morrel , in breaking a horse that no one can ride . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for example , you see these two fish; one brought from fifty leagues beyond st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> petersburg , the other five leagues from naples . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it not amusing to see them both on the same table? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> chteau - renaud , who has lived in russia , will tell you the name of one , and major cavalcanti , who is an italian , will tell you the name of the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this one is , i think , a sterlet , said chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that one , if i mistake not , a lamprey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , ask these gentlemen where they are caught . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exactly; one comes from the volga , and the other from lake fusaro . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - impossible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried all the guests simultaneously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , this is just what amuses me , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am like nerocupitor impossibilium; and that is what is amusing you at this moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this fish , which seems so exquisite to you , is very likely no better than perch or salmon; but it seemed impossible to procure it , and here it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but how could you have these fish brought to france? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , nothing more easy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you do not believe me , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - baptistin , said the count ,  - have the other fish brought inthe sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks , and which are yet alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars opened his bewildered eyes; the company clapped their hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants , and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but why have two of each sort? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - merely because one might have died , carelessly answered monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are certainly an extraordinary man , said danglars;  - and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , do not give me credit for this , madame; it was done by the romans , who much esteemed them , and pliny relates that they sent slaves from ostia to rome , who carried on their heads fish which he calls the mulus , and which , from the description , must probably be the goldfish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their agony formed part of their meritif they were not seen alive , they were despised when dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , said monte cristo;  - but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus , if we can do no better than he could? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes , but had the good sense not to say anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly not longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i am sure it is quite transformed since last week . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i remember rightly , it had another entrance , and the courtyard was paved and empty; while today we have a splendid lawn , bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am fond of grass and shade , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in four days , said morrel;  - it is extraordinary! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , said chteau - renaud ,  - it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one; for it was very old , and dull too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de saint - mran? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said madame de villefort;  - then this house belonged to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de saint - mran before you bought it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - quite so; my steward transacts all this business for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied , said chteau - renaud ,  - and it was quite melancholy to look at it , with the blinds closed , the doors locked , and the weeds in the court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> really , if the house had not belonged to the father - in - law of the procureur , one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him , here took one , and drank it off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo allowed a short time to elapse , and then said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is probable , stammered out villefort , trying to smile;  - but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this house is part of valentine s marriage - portion , and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de saint - mran wished to sell it; for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there was , above all , one room , continued monte cristo ,  - very plain in appearance , hung with red damask , which , i know not why , appeared to me quite dramatic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars;  - why dramatic? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can we account for instinct? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadness? why , we cannot tell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a chain of recollectionsan idea which carries you back to other times , to other placeswhich , very likely , have no connection with the present time and place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de ganges[10] or desdemona . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo looked inquiringly at his guests . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment , as if rooted to their seats; they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each one went out by the open doors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo waited for the two who remained; then , when they had passed , he brought up the rear , and on his face was a smile , which , if they could have understood it , would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they began by walking through the apartments , many of which were fitted up in the eastern style , with cushions and divans instead of beds , and pipes instead of furniture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the drawing - rooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters , the boudoirs hung with draperies from china , of fanciful colors , fantastic design , and wonderful texture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length they arrived at the famous room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried madame de villefort ,  - it is really frightful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many observations were made , the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it not so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look at that large clumsy bed , hung with such gloomy , blood - colored drapery! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and those two crayon portraits , that have faded from the dampness; do they not seem to say , with their pale lips and staring eyes , we have seen ? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort became livid; madame danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars rose suddenly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then , said monte cristo ,  - this is not all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is there more? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said debray , who had not failed to notice the agitation of madame danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , what else is there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars;  - for , at present , i cannot say that i have seen anything extraordinary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , but you have not this little staircase , said monte cristo , opening a door concealed by the drapery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look at it , and tell me what you think of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a wicked - looking , crooked staircase , said chteau - renaud with a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy , but certainly everything appears to me black in this house , said debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ever since valentine s dowry had been mentioned , morrel had been silent and sad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can you imagine , said monte cristo ,  - some othello or abb de ganges , one stormy , dark night , descending these stairs step by step , carrying a load , which he wishes to hide from the sight of man , if not from god? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort , who was obliged to support himself against the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , madame , cried debray ,  - what is the matter with you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how pale you look! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us , doubtless intending to frighten us to death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said villefort ,  - really , count , you frighten the ladies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing , she replied with a violent effort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i want air , that is all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , she answered ,  - i would rather remain here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you really frightened , madame? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , sir , said madame danglars;  - but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes , said monte cristo smiling;  - it is all a matter of imagination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and this bed with red hangings , a bed visited by the goddess lucina? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and that mysterious staircase , the passage through which , not to disturb their sleep , the doctor and nurse pass , or even the father carrying the sleeping child? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here madame danglars , instead of being calmed by the soft picture , uttered a groan and fainted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame danglars is ill , said villefort;  - it would be better to take her to her carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , mon dieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo ,  - and i have forgotten my smelling - bottle! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have mine , said madame de villefort; and she passed over to monte cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on edward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said monte cristo , taking it from her hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , she said ,  - at your advice i have made the trial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and have you succeeded? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars was carried into the adjoining room; monte cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips; she returned to consciousness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , she cried ,  - what a frightful dream! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , but , as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas , he had gone into the garden , and was talking with major cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo seemed in despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really , madame , he said ,  - did i alarm you much? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort forced a laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then , you know , he said ,  - an idea , a supposition , is sufficient . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take care , said madame de villefort ,  - the king s attorney is here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your declaration? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , this is very interesting , said debray;  - if there really has been a crime , we will investigate it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there has been a crime , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come this way , gentlemen; come , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , for a declaration to be available , should be made before the competent authorities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the other guests followed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stay , said monte cristo ,  - here , in this very spot ( and he stamped upon the ground ) ,  - i had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in , to refresh these old trees; well , my man , digging , found a box , or rather , the iron - work of a box , in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said chteau - renaud ,  - i was not wrong just now then , when i said that houses had souls and faces like men , and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this house was gloomy because it was remorseful: it was remorseful because it concealed a crime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked villefort , with a last effort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and pray what do you call such an action? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but who said it was buried alive? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this garden has never been a cemetery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is done to infanticides in this country? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think so; am i not right , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , count , replied villefort , in a voice now scarcely human . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo , seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it , and not wishing to carry it too far , said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , count , said madame danglars ,  - i am ashamed to own it , but all your frightful stories have so upset me , that i must beg you to let me sit down; and she fell into a chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo bowed , and went to madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think madame danglars again requires your bottle , he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but before madame de villefort could reach her friend , the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars ,  - i must speak to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tomorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in my office , or in the court , if you like ,that is the surest place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will be there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment madame de villefort approached . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the evening passed on; madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris , which madame danglars had not dared to do , notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on his wife s request , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort was the first to give the signal of departure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars , that she might be under the care of his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without opposing their arrangements , he allowed morrel , chteau - renaud , and debray to leave on horseback , and the ladies in m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort s carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , more and more delighted with major cavalcanti , had offered him a seat in his carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent lad , and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people , amongst whom , with dilating eyes , he saw the king s attorney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he had been seized upon by danglars , who , with a rapid glance at the stiff - necked old major and his modest son , and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count , made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major s little finger; for the major , like a prudent man , in case of any accident happening to his bank - notes , had immediately converted them into an available asset . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , after dinner , on the pretext of business , he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living; and the father and son , previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his 48 ,000 francs and the other 50 ,000 livres annually , were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker s servants , so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one thing above all the rest heightened the respect , nay almost the veneration , of danglars for cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter , faithful to the principle of horace , nil admirari , had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he had eaten some without saying a word more; danglars , therefore , concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti , who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland , and lobsters sent from england , by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro , and the sterlet from the volga . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tomorrow , sir , i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him , that he had his own horses and carriages , and that not having come together , it would not be difficult for them to leave separately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the major seated himself , therefore , by the side of danglars , who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man , and yet who , being able to allow his son 60 ,000 francs a year , might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500 ,000 or 600 ,000 livres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for andrea , he began , by way of showing off , to scold his groom , who , instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house , had taken it to the outer door , thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the groom heard him with humility , took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand , and with the right held out the reins to andrea , who , taking them from him , rested his polished boot lightly on the step . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a red handkerchief encircled his gray head; torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs , which seemed as though , like those of a skeleton , they would rattle as he walked; and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man s shoulder , and which was the first thing andrea saw , seemed of gigantic size . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we cannot say; but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you want of me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pardon me , my friend , if i disturb you , said the man with the red handkerchief ,  - but i want to speak to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said andrea , with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation ,  - what do you want? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> speak quickly , friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man said , in a low voice:  - i wishi wish you to spare me the walk back to paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am very tired , and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you , i can scarcely stand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , i want you to take me up in your fine carriage , and carry me back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea turned pale , but said nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the surprised groom retired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , as for that , i ll take you to a splendid place , said the man with the handkerchief; and taking the horse s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage , said he;  - oh , no , it s only because i am tired , and also because i have a little business to talk over with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , step in , said the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how have i deceived you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when we parted at the pont du var , you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany; but instead of that , you come to paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how does that annoy you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it does not; on the contrary , i think it will answer my purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , said andrea ,  - you are speculating upon me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i warn you , master caderousse , that you are mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know i always did call you my child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - patiencepatience! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am patient , but go on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so that , as you confess , you are jealous? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i am pleasedso pleased that i wished to congratulate you; but as i am not quite properly dressed , i chose my opportunity , that i might not compromise you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , and a fine opportunity you have chosen! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how can i help that , my boy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i speak to you when i can catch you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have a quick horse , a light tilbury , you are naturally as slippery as an eel; if i had missed you tonight , i might not have had another chance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was very polite of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said andrea ,  - what do you want? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you do not speak affectionately to me , benedetto , my old friend , that is not righttake care , or i may become troublesome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he urged the horse again into a trot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you should not speak so to an old friend like me , caderousse , as you said just now; you are a native of marseilles , i am<s> <s>  - do you know then now what you are? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , but i was brought up in corsica; you are old and obstinate , i am young and wilful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> between people like us threats are out of place , everything should be amicably arranged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it my fault if fortune , which has frowned on you , has been kind to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fortune has been kind to you , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your tilbury , your groom , your clothes , are not then hired? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good , so much the better , said caderousse , his eyes sparkling with avarice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you knew that well enough before speaking to me , said andrea , becoming more and more excited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head , rags on my back , and worn - out shoes on my feet , you would not have known me . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - come , come; i always said you were a fine fellow , and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but tell me all about it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why do you wish to know? </s> </s>

<s> <s> what is his name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - major cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so far i have appeared to answer his purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who found this father for you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the man whose house you have just left? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile , what are you going to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - since you interest yourself in my affairs , i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well; i shall rent a room in some respectable house , wear a decent coat , shave every day , and go and read the papers in a caf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , in the evening , i shall go to the theatre; i shall look like some retired baker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is what i want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , if you will only put this scheme into execution , and be steady , nothing could be better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think so , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and youwhat will you become? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a peer of france? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said andrea ,  - who knows? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - major cavalcanti is already one , perhaps; but then , hereditary rank is abolished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no politics , caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now that you have all you want , and that we understand each other , jump down from the tilbury and disappear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not at all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , just think for a moment; with this red handkerchief on my head , with scarcely any shoes , no papers , and ten gold napoleons in my pocket , without reckoning what was there beforemaking in all about two hundred francs ,why , i should certainly be arrested at the barriers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , to justify myself , i should say that you gave me the money; this would cause inquiries , it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice , and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then i should become simply no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 106 , and good - bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea scowled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> certainly , as he had himself owned , the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he drew up for a minute , threw a rapid glance around him , and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket , where it began playing with a pistol . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , meanwhile , caderousse , who had never taken his eyes off his companion , passed his hand behind his back , and opened a long spanish knife , which he always carried with him , to be ready in case of need . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two friends , as we see , were worthy of and understood one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea s hand left his pocket inoffensively , and was carried up to the red moustache , which it played with for some time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will do my best , said the innkeeper of the pont du gard , shutting up his knife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , we will go into paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait , said caderousse ,  - we shall see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then took the greatcoat with the large collar , which the groom had left behind in the tilbury , and put it on his back; then he took off cavalcanti s hat , which he placed upon his own head , and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pooh , said caderousse;  - it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , come; enough of this , said cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what are you waiting for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope i am not the cause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush , said andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse , and caderousse leaped out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said andrea , - my servant s coat and my hat? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said caderousse ,  - you would not like me to risk taking cold? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what am i to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , you are young while i am beginning to get old . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> au revoir , benedetto; and running into a court , he disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , said andrea , sighing ,  - one cannot be completely happy in this world! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the place louis xv . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the three young people separatedthat is to say , morrel went to the boulevards , chteau - renaud to the pont de la rvolution , and debray to the quai . </s> </s>

<s> <s> debray , with the air of a man familiar with the house , entered first into the court , threw his bridle into the hands of a footman , and returned to the door to receive madame danglars , to whom he offered his arm , to conduct her to her apartments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gate once closed , and debray and the baroness alone in the court , he asked: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are deceived , lucien , i assure you , replied madame danglars;  - and what i have told you is really the case , added to the ill - humor you remarked , but which i did not think it worth while to allude to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to themselves; or that , as debray had guessed , she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood , he did not then press his inquiries , but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her , or receive an avowal proprio motu . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she practiced all the evening , and then went to bed , replied mademoiselle cornlie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yet i think i hear her piano . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is mademoiselle louise d armilly , who is playing while mademoiselle danglars is in bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said madame danglars ,  - come and undress me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they entered the bedroom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray stretched himself upon a large couch , and madame danglars passed into her dressing - room with mademoiselle cornlie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my study? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at least that of the minister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why so! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to ask for an engagement at the opera . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> really , i never saw such an infatuation for music; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cornlie obeyed , and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming loose dress , and came and sat down close to debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lucien looked at her for a moment in silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , hermine , he said , after a short time ,  - answer candidly ,something vexes youis it not so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet , as she could scarcely breathe , she rose and went towards a looking - glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am frightful tonight , she said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray rose , smiling , and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point , when the door opened suddenly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars appeared; debray reseated himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the noise of the door madame danglars turned round , and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - evening , madame , said the banker;  - good - evening , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> assuming a dignified air , she turned round to debray , without answering her husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , she said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , who was slightly disturbed at this visit , recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness , and took up a book marked by a mother - of - pearl knife inlaid with gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray was petrified , not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely , but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the result was , that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , said the banker ,  - do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars , for you can hear them as well tomorrow; but i claim tonight and will devote it , if you will allow me , to talk over some serious matters with my wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time the blow was so well aimed , and hit so directly , that lucien and the baroness were staggered , and they interrogated each other with their eyes , as if to seek help against this aggression , but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed , and the husband was victorious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not think i wish to turn you out , my dear debray , continued danglars;  - oh , no , not at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is extraordinary , he said , when the door was closed behind him ,  - how easily these husbands , whom we ridicule , gain an advantage over us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know , sir , asked the baroness ,  - that you are improving? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is because i am in a worse humor than usual , replied danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what have i to do with your ill - humor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the baroness , irritated at the impassibility of her husband;  - do these things concern me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> keep your ill - humor at home in your money boxes , or , since you have clerks whom you pay , vent it upon them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my money boxes are my pactolus , as , i think , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demoustier says , and i will not retard its course , or disturb its calm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my clerks are honest men , who earn my fortune , whom i pay much below their deserts , if i may value them according to what they bring in; therefore i shall not get into a passion with them; those with whom i will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners , mount my horses , and exhaust my fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> explain yourself more clearly , i beg , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , make yourself easy! i am not speaking riddles , and you will soon know what i mean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not understand you , sir , said the baroness , trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you understand me perfectly , on the contrary , said danglars:  - but , if you will persist , i will tell you that i have just lost 700 ,000 francs upon the spanish loan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and pray , asked the baroness ,  - am i responsible for this loss? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it my fault you have lost 700 ,000 francs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly it is not mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - once for all , sir , replied the baroness sharply ,  - i tell you i will not hear cash named; it is a style of language i never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i can well believe that , for neither of them was worth a penny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank , which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night; that noise of jingling crowns , which are constantly being counted and re - counted , is odious to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i only know one thing i dislike more , which is the sound of your voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , this surprises me , for i thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - most assuredly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should like to know upon what occasion? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , mon dieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre , that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know how clear - sighted your dreams are; i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt , and i gained 400 ,000 francs by it , of which 100 ,000 have been honestly paid to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you told me that your instinct ,and although you pretend to know nothing about speculations , i think on the contrary , that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs ,well , you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the southern . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i bought two thirds of the shares of that company; as you had foreseen , the shares trebled in value , and i picked up a million , from which 250 ,000 francs were paid to you for pin - money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when are you coming to the point? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the baroness , shivering with anger and impatience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in april you went to dine at the minister s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairson the expulsion of don carlos . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i bought some spanish shares . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were yours , you disposed of them according to your fancy , and i asked no questions; but it is not the less true that you have this year received 500 ,000 livres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , sir , and what then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes , it was just after this that you spoiled everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , three days after that you talked politics with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what you say is absurd , and i cannot see why m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray s name is mixed up in this affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because if you do not possess the 175 ,000 francs i reclaim , you must have lent them to your friends , and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray is one of your friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the baroness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the baroness became enraged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wretch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she cried ,  - will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not say that i did know it , and i do not say that i did not know it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife , and see whether it has not always been consistent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some time after our rupture , you wished to study music , under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the thtre italien; at the same time i felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in london . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this cost me , on your account and mine , 100 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i said nothing , for we must have peace in the house; and 100 ,000 francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , you soon become tired of singing , and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the minister s secretary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stop there , madame , for this cannot last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis , and i will tolerate him , or he must never set his foot again in my house;do you understand , madame? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , this is too much , cried hermine , choking ,  - you are worse than despicable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , continued danglars ,  - i find you did not even pause there<s> <s>  - insults! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are right; let us leave these facts alone , and reason coolly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good; treat me in the same way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you say you have nothing to do with my cash box . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , how do i know that this was not a political trick , that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition , and jealous of the popular sympathy i excite , has not concerted with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a probable thing! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who ever heard of such an occurrence as this? a false telegraphic despatchit is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said the baroness humbly ,  - are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed , that they talked of going to law with him , that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight , which proves that he was either mad or guilty? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a mistake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , which made fools laugh , which caused the minister to have a sleepless night , which has caused the minister s secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper , but which has cost me 700 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , why , instead of going direct to him , do you come and tell me of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , to accuse the man , do you address the woman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray? do i wish to know him? do i wish to know that he gives advice? do i wish to follow it? do i speculate? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - foolish creature , he exclaimed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband , who has but the commencement of the artfor generally husbands will not seeyou would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it has not been so with me ,i see , and always have seen , during the last sixteen years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you may , perhaps , have hidden a thought; but not a step , not an action , not a fault , has escaped me , while you flattered yourself upon your address , and firmly believed you had deceived me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what has been the result? that , thanks to my pretended ignorance , there is none of your friends , from m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> debray , who has not trembled before me . </s> </s>

<s> <s> debray has made me lose 700 ,000 francs; let him bear his share of the loss , and we will go on as before; if not , let him become bankrupt for the 250 ,000 livres , and do as all bankrupts dodisappear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is a charming fellow , i allow , when his news is correct; but when it is not , there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars did not even look at her , though she did her best to faint . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shut the bedroom door after him , without adding another word , and returned to his apartments; and when madame danglars recovered from her half - fainting condition , she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this time , that is , about half - past twelve , madame danglars ordered her carriage , and went out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared; but at two o clock she had not returned . </s> </s>

<s> <s> from twelve to two o clock danglars had remained in his study , unsealing his dispatches , and becoming more and more sad every minute , heaping figure upon figure , and receiving , among other visits , one from major cavalcanti , who , as stiff and exact as ever , presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before , to terminate his business with the banker . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - pardon me , said he ,  - my dear baron , but one of my friends , the abb busoni , whom you perhaps saw pass by , has just arrived in paris; not having seen him for a long time , i could not make up my mind to leave him sooner , so i hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> melancholy in a capitalist , like the appearance of a comet , presages some misfortune to the world . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but do you mean to say you have not heard of this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i heard it spoken of , but i did not know the details , and then no one can be more ignorant than i am of the affairs in the bourse . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i should be obliged , besides my steward , to keep a clerk and a boy . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i think this is about your position , is it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the result , then , of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third - rate house to despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , you have not;well , you are right , for if you indulged in such reflections , you would never risk your principal , which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have our clothes , some more splendid than others ,this is our credit; but when a man dies he has only his skin; in the same way , on retiring from business , you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions , at the most; for third - rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be , like the locomotive on a railway , the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you want money? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you wish me to lend you some? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a bad calculator you are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed danglars , calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have made up the loss of blood by nutrition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i lost a battle in spain , i have been defeated in trieste , but my naval army in india will have taken some galleons , and my mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - but , while we are speaking of business , danglars added , pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject ,  - tell me what i am to do for m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give him money , if he is recommended to you , and the recommendation seems good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but that is not all , continued danglars;  - he has opened an account with my house for his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may i ask how much he allows the young man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sixty thousand francs per year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought i was right in believing that cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can a young man live upon 5 ,000 francs a month? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , i would advance ten millions on his signature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was only speaking in reference to the second - rate fortunes we were mentioning just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and with all this , how unassuming he is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you would have flattered him , for certainly , as you say , he has no manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but all the italians are the same; they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because you met him at my house , just after his introduction into the world , as they told me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has been travelling with a very severe tutor , and had never been to paris before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sure of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you have heard his fortune mentioned? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what is your opinion? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , and it is that<s> <s>  - my opinion is , that all these old podests , these ancient condottieri ,for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces ,my opinion , i say , is , that they have buried their millions in corners , the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons , who have done the same from generation to generation; and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance , like the florins of the republic , which , from being constantly gazed upon , have become reflected in them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , said danglars ,  - and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very little , at least; i know of none which cavalcanti possesses , excepting his palace in lucca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , he has a palace? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars , laughing;  - come , that is something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; and more than that , he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , you do not flatter him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i scarcely know him; i think i have seen him three times in my life; all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was telling me this morning that , tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy , which is a dead nation , he wished to find a method , either in france or england , of multiplying his millions , but remember , that though i place great confidence in busoni , i am not responsible for this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the way , this is merely a simple question , when this sort of people marry their sons , do they give them any fortune? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , that depends upon circumstances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> should andrea marry according to his father s views , he will , perhaps , give him one , two , or three millions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess; he will want a crown , an el dorado , and potos . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do you wish to marry andrea , my dear m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - albert , repeated danglars , shrugging his shoulders;  - ah , well; he would care very little about it , i think . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mademoiselle danglars  fortune will be great , no doubt , especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i do not mean her fortune only; but tell me<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did so , but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , said danglars , laughing ,  - it would do her a great deal of good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because it is the air she always breathed in her youth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but still , if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars , said the count ,  - you must allow that he has a fine name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly; your name is popular , and does honor to the title they have adorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice , too firmly rooted to be exterminated , a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and for this very reason , said danglars with a smile , which he tried to make sardonic ,  - i prefer m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because , though i am not a baron by birth , my real name is , at least , danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - while his name is not morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not the least in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have been made a baron , so that i actually am one; he made himself a count , so that he is not one at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen my dear count; m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know i have made the most of my arms , though i never forgot my origin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , when i was a clerk , morcerf was a mere fisherman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then he was called<s> <s>  - fernand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - only fernand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are sure? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pardieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because fernand and danglars , being both parvenus , both having become noble , both rich , are about equal in worth , excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , nothing! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes; what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mondego . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in conjunction with the affairs of ali pasha? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exactly so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is the mystery , said danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it would be very easy if you much wished it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - probably you have some correspondent in greece? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should think so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at yanina? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are right , exclaimed danglars , rising quickly ,  - i will write today . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and if you should hear of anything very scandalous<s> <s>  - i will communicate it to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will oblige me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars rushed out of the room , and made but one leap into his coup . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed , and follow madame danglars in her morning excursion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have said that at half - past twelve o clock madame danglars had ordered her horses , and had left home in the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was very plainly dressed , as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the rue gungaud she called a cab , and directed the driver to go to the rue de harlay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as she was seated in the vehicle , she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil , which she tied on to her straw bonnet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she then replaced the bonnet , and saw with pleasure , in a little pocket - mirror , that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cab crossed the pont - neuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine; the driver was paid as the door opened , and stepping lightly up the stairs madame danglars soon reached the salle des pas - perdus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a great deal going on that morning , and many business - like persons at the palais; business - like persons pay very little attention to women , and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a great press of people in m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort s antechamber , but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the instant she appeared the door - keeper rose , came to her , and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment; and on her affirmative answer being given , he conducted her by a private passage to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort s office . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the magistrate was seated in an armchair , writing , with his back towards the door; he did not move as he heard it open , and the door - keeper pronounce the words ,  - walk in , madame , and then reclose it; but no sooner had the man s footsteps ceased , than he started up , drew the bolts , closed the curtains , and examined every corner of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard , and was consequently relieved of doubts , he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thanks , madame ,thanks for your punctuality; and he offered a chair to madame danglars , which she accepted , for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a long time , madame , said the procureur , describing a half - circle with his chair , so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame danglars , - it is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you , and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nevertheless , sir , you see i have answered your first appeal , although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort smiled bitterly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas , to many the path is traced by tears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said madame danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think , sir , you exaggerate your situation , said madame danglars , whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the world excuses , and notoriety ennobles you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if my brow be severe , it is because many misfortunes have clouded it; if my heart be petrified , it is that it might sustain the blows it has received . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was not so in my youth , i was not so on the night of the betrothal , when we were all seated around a table in the rue du cours at marseilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but since then everything has changed in and about me; i am accustomed to brave difficulties , and , in the conflict to crush those who , by their own free will , or by chance , voluntarily or involuntarily , interfere with me in my career . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , the greater number of a man s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity; then , after error has been committed in a moment of excitement , of delirium , or of fear , we see that we might have avoided and escaped it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in any case , sir , you will allow , replied madame danglars ,  - that , even if the fault were alone mine , i last night received a severe punishment for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i must tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> collect all your courage , for you have not yet heard all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you only look back to the past , and it is , indeed , bad enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , picture to yourself a future more gloomy stillcertainly frightful , perhaps sanguinary! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how has this terrible past been recalled? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried villefort;  - how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts , where it was buried , to visit us now , like a phantom , whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , said hermine ,  - doubtless it is chance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - chance? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied villefort;  - no , no , madame , there is no such thing as chance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes; has not a fatal chance revealed all this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it not by chance the count of monte cristo bought that house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , no , madame ,this is the terrible news i have to tell you , said villefort in a hollow voice - no , nothing was found beneath the flowers; there was no child disinterredno . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what can you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked madame danglars , shuddering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - neither of them there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated madame danglars , her staring , wide - open eyes expressing her alarm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - neither of them there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she again said , as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you did not bury the poor child there , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why did you deceive me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where did you place it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell mewhere? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you frighten me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but speak; i will listen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you recollect that sad night , when you were half - expiring on that bed in the red damask room , while i , scarcely less agitated than you , awaited your delivery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the child was born , was given to memotionless , breathless , voiceless; we thought it dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we thought it dead , he repeated;  - i placed it in the chest , which was to take the place of a coffin; i descended to the garden , i dug a hole , and then flung it down in haste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely had i covered it with earth , when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me; i saw a shadow rise , and , at the same time , a flash of light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i felt pain; i wished to cry out , but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice; i fell lifeless , and fancied myself killed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never shall i forget your sublime courage , when , having returned to consciousness , i dragged myself to the foot of the stairs , and you , almost dying yourself , came to meet me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you had the fortitude to regain the house , assisted by your nurse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a duel was the pretext for my wound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> four men carried me from paris to chlons , walking six leagues a day; madame de villefort followed the litter in her carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at chlons i was put upon the sane , thence i passed on to the rhne , whence i descended , merely with the current , to arles; at arles i was again placed on my litter , and continued my journey to marseilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my recovery lasted six months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never heard you mentioned , and i did not dare inquire for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> always the samealways the child s corpse , coming every night in my dreams , rising from the earth , and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife s father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease; they demanded 6 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had the money with me; i made the tenant sign the deed of resilition , and when i had obtained what i so much wanted , i galloped to auteuil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one had entered the house since i had left it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the corsican , who had declared the vendetta against me , who had followed me from nmes to paris , who had hid himself in the garden , who had struck me , had seen me dig the grave , had seen me inter the child ,he might become acquainted with your person ,nay , he might even then have known it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was therefore necessary , before everything else , and at all risks , that i should cause all traces of the past to disappearthat i should destroy every material vestige; too much reality would always remain in my recollection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was for this i had annulled the leaseit was for this i had comeit was for this i was waiting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was without a light in that room; when the wind shook all the doors , behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed , i trembled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , one by one , all the noises in the neighborhood ceased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i understood that i had nothing to fear , that i should neither be seen nor heard , so i decided upon descending to the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last i mastered my agitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i grasped the railings; if i had relaxed my hold for a moment , i should have fallen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> outside this door a spade was placed against the wall; i took it , and advanced towards the thicket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had provided myself with a dark lantern . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it , then i continued my path . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was the end of november , all the verdure of the garden had disappeared , the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms , and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i looked carefully around; i was indeed alone ,no noise disturbed the silence but the owl , whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer , and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention; it evidently was there i had turned up the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i went to work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hour , then , for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i turned around , i looked at the trees , i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a cold , sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches , and yet the drops fell from my forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole; while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum; behind me was an artificial rockery , intended to serve as a resting - place for persons walking in the garden; in falling , my hand , relaxing its hold of the laburnum , felt the coldness of the stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on my right i saw the tree , behind me the rock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i rose , and again began digging and enlarging the hole; still i found nothing , nothingthe chest was no longer there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the chest no longer there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured madame danglars , choking with fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - think not i contented myself with this one effort , continued villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; i searched the whole thicket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought the assassin , having discovered the chest , and supposing it to be a treasure , had intended carrying it off , but , perceiving his error , had dug another hole , and deposited it there; but i could find nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions , and had simply thrown it in a corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i remained in the room and waited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when daylight dawned i went down again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my first visit was to the thicket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square , and a depth of two feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i could find nothingabsolutely nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> supposing it had been thrown aside , it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate; but this examination was as useless as the first , and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket , which now contained no hope for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , cried madame danglars ,  - it was enough to drive you mad! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hoped for a moment that it might , said villefort;  - but that happiness was denied me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , no , madame , that could not be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , nothing of the kind has happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked hermine , trembling violently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - something more terrible , more fatal , more alarming for usthe child was , perhaps , alive , and the assassin may have saved it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she;  - you buried my child alive? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah<s> <s> madame danglars had risen , and stood before the procureur , whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know not; i merely suppose so , as i might suppose anything else , replied villefort with a look so fixed , it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the baroness , falling on her chair , and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , becoming somewhat reassured , perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head , he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you understand , then , that if it were so , said he , rising in his turn , and approaching the baroness , to speak to her in a lower tone ,  - we are lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this child lives , and someone knows it livessomeone is in possession of our secret; and since monte cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred , when that child could not be found , it is he who is in possession of our secret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just god , avenging god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but the childthe child , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how i have searched for him , replied villefort , wringing his hands;  - how i have called him in my long sleepless nights; how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men , and to find mine among them! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - impossible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried madame danglars:  - a man may murder another out of revenge , but he would not deliberately drown a child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps , continued villefort ,  - he had put it in the foundling hospital . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , yes , cried the baroness;  - my child is there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ran to the hospital , and learned that the same nightthe night of the 20th of septembera child had been brought there , wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin , purposely torn in half . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this portion of the napkin was marked with half a baron s crown , and the letter h . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , it was not dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort shrugged his shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do i know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he;  - and do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a woman , about six months after , came to claim it with the other half of the napkin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you should have inquired for the woman; you should have traced her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what do you think i did? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , forever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh , a tear , or a shriek for every detail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and this is all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she;  - and you stopped there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , said villefort;  - i never ceased to search and to inquire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever , since fear urges me , not my conscience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , the wickedness of man is very great , said villefort ,  - since it surpasses the goodness of god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you observe that man s eyes while he was speaking to us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but have you ever watched him carefully? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you see you would have been deceived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , doubtless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but believe me , that man has other projects . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for that reason i wished to see you , to speak to you , to warn you against everyone , but especially against him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you keep a journal? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , my life has been passed in frivolity; i wish to forget it myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the color mounted to the baroness s face , and villefort turned awfully pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is true , said he , in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i understand what i now have to do , replied villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo is , whence he comes , where he goes , and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him , and led her respectfully back to the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the procureur , a travelling - carriage entered the rue du helder , passed through the gateway of no . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the count received him with his habitual smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man s favor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those who would , as it were , force a passage to his heart , found an impassable barrier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morcerf , who ran towards him with open arms , was chilled as he drew near , in spite of the friendly smile , and simply held out his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - welcome home again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from dieppe? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , from trport . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is extremely kind of you , said monte cristo with a tone of perfect indifference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what is the news? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you should not ask a stranger , a foreigner , for news . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray tell me how it happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars dined with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know it; to avoid meeting him , my mother and i left town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but he met here m . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - calls himself , do you say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he calls himself so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i , of course , give him the same title , and everyone else does likewise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a strange man you are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what next? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars dined here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , with count cavalcanti , the marquis his father , madame danglars , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and madame de villefort ,charming people ,m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did they speak of me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so much the worse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if they did not speak of me , i am sure they thought about me , and i am in despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how will that affect you , since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> truly , she might have thought of you at home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - touching sympathy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , said morcerf - if mademoiselle danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account , and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families , i am ready to agree to the arrangement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a word , mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistressbut a wifediable! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; it is rather unkind , i acknowledge , but it is true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are difficult to please , viscount . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , for i often wish for what is impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to find such a wife as my father found . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo turned pale , and looked at albert , while playing with some magnificent pistols . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your father was fortunate , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know my opinion of my mother , count; look at her ,still beautiful , witty , more charming than ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at trport , it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom , while i return , more contented , more peacefulshall i say more poetic! than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is an overwhelming demonstration , and you would make everyone vow to live a single life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the diamond which glittered in the window at marl s or fossin s shines with more splendor when it is our own; but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another , and still must retain the one that is inferior , do you not know what we have to endure? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - worldling , murmured the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thus i shall rejoice when mademoiselle eugnie perceives i am but a pitiful atom , with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo smiled . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - that is what i call devoted friendship , to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - apropos , continued he ,  - franz is coming soon , but it will not interest you; you dislike him , i think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo;  - my dear viscount , how have you discovered that i did not like m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i like everyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you include me in the expression everyonemany thanks! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us not mistake , said monte cristo;  - i love everyone as god commands us to love our neighbor , as christians; but i thoroughly hate but a few . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us return to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; summoned by m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown - up daughter; it seems to make one feverish , and to raise one s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay , unlike you , bears his misfortune patiently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - still more , he talks seriously about the matter , puts on a white tie , and speaks of his family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he entertains a very high opinion of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which they deserve , do they not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is , then , one , said monte cristo ,  - whom you do not condemn like poor danglars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps , replied albert , laughing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i foppish? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; pray take a cigar , and cease to defend yourself , and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let things take their course; perhaps you may not have to retract . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert , staring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doubtless , my dear viscount , you will not be taken by force; and seriously , do you wish to break off your engagement? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then make yourself quite easy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - am i , indeed , so happy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert , who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars any reason? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is your proud and selfish nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but yet , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars appeared<s> <s>  - delighted with you , was he not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , i understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but my motherno , not my mother; i mistakemy father intends giving a ball . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a ball at this season? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if they were not , the countess has only to wish it , and they would become so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are right; you know they are select affairs; those who remain in paris in july must be true parisians . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you take charge of our invitation to messieurs cavalcanti? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on saturday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you do not know him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i never saw him until a few days since , and am not responsible for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is another thing: he was recommended to me by a good abb , who may be deceived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give him a direct invitation , but do not ask me to present him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars , you would accuse me of intrigue , and would be challenging me ,besides , i may not be there myself . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - ah , count , said albert ,  - i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me , and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you , you must be entirely devoid of them , for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have talked of me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a problem , my dear count , for everyonefor my mother as well as others; much studied , but not solved , you still remain an enigma , do not fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i believe , while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven , my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saint - germain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first opportunity you have , confirm her in her opinion; it will be easy for you , as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thank you for the warning , said the count;  - i shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions . </s> </s>

<s> <s> does madame de morcerf dance? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , truly; and i assure you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert rose and took his hat; the count conducted him to the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have one thing to reproach myself with , said he , stopping albert on the steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have spoken to you indiscreetly about danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on the contrary , speak to me always in the same strain about him . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - until saturday , when i may expect you , may i not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i promised you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had mounted his phaeton , monte cristo turned , and seeing bertuccio ,  - what news? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did she stay long there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did she return home? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio bowed , and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received , he started the same evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars , to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wrote the same day for the required information to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville , who , from having been an inspector of prisons , was promoted to a high office in the police; and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of the second day m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord wilmore , a rich foreigner , who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment; he is also known to the abb busoni , a sicilian priest , of high repute in the east , where he has done much good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons; his orders were executed , and the following evening he received these details: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the abb , who was in paris only for a month , inhabited a small two - storied house behind saint - sulpice; there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two lower rooms consisted of a dining - room , with a table , chairs , and side - board of walnut , and a wainscoted parlor , without ornaments , carpet , or timepiece . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he preferred to use the sitting - room upstairs , which was more library than parlor , and was furnished with theological books and parchments , in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time , according to his valet de chambre . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket; and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him , he replied that the abb was not in paris , an answer which satisfied most persons , because the abb was known to be a great traveller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , whether at home or not , whether in paris or cairo , the abb always left something to give away , which the valet distributed through this wicket in his master s name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a bed without curtains , four armchairs , and a couch , covered with yellow utrecht velvet , composed , with a prie - dieu , all its furniture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lord wilmore resided in rue fontaine - saint - georges . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was one of those english tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he hired the apartment in which he lived furnished , passed only a few hours in the day there , and rarely slept there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day after this important information had been given to the king s attorney , a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue frou , and rapping at an olive - green door , asked if the abb busoni were within . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , he went out early this morning , replied the valet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i might not always be content with that answer , replied the visitor ,  - for i come from one to whom everyone must be at home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will he be at home at eight o clock this evening? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doubtless , unless he is at work , which is the same as if he were out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will come again at that time , replied the visitor , who then retired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage , which , instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue frou , drove up to the green door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he knocked , and it opened immediately to admit him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is the abb at home? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; he is at work in his library , but he expects you , sir , replied the valet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger ascended a rough staircase , and before a table , illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness , he perceived the abb in a monk s dress , with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have i the honor of addressing the abb busoni? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the visitor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville , formerly an inspector of prisons , sends to me from the prefect of police? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation , and blushing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb replaced the large spectacles , which covered not only his eyes but his temples , and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am at your service , sir , said the abb , with a marked italian accent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the mission with which i am charged , sir , replied the visitor , speaking with hesitation ,  - is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it , and him by whom he is employed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your probity , replied the stranger ,  - is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety , to ascertain which i am deputed to see you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - provided , sir , the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am a priest , sir , and the secrets of confession , for instance , must remain between me and god , and not between me and human justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not alarm yourself , monsieur , we will duly respect your conscience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment the abb pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other , throwing a bright light on the stranger s face , while his own remained obscured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excuse me , abb , said the envoy of the prefect of the police ,  - but the light tries my eyes very much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb lowered the shade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , sir , i am listeninggo on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will come at once to the point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you know the count of monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - zaccone? is not his name monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monte cristo is the name of an estate , or , rather , of a rock , and not a family name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> zaccone are the same<s> <s>  - absolutely the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us speak of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> zaccone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - agreed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i asked you if you knew him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the son of a rich shipbuilder in malta . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know that is the report; but , as you are aware , the police does not content itself with vague reports . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you sure of what you assert? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean by that question? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - understand , sir , i do not in the least suspect your veracity; i ask if you are certain of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i knew his father , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and when a child i often played with the son in the timber - yards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but whence does he derive the title of count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are aware that may be bought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in italy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they may not be so very great . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how much do you suppose he possesses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i was told he had four millions per annum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is not probable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , everyone who has come from palermo , naples , or rome to france by sea must know it , since he has passed close to it and must have seen it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a rock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and why has the count bought a rock? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in italy one must have territorial possessions to be a count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have , doubtless , heard the adventures of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> zaccone s youth? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the father s? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , the son s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know nothing certain; at that period of his life , i lost sight of my young comrade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - was he in the wars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think he entered the service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in what branch? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the navy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you not his confessor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir; i believe he is a lutheran . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a lutheran? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i say , i believe such is the case , i do not affirm it; besides , liberty of conscience is established in france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our holy father , the pope , has made him a knight of jesus christ for the services he rendered to the christians in the east; he has five or six rings as testimonials from eastern monarchs of his services . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , but he is proud of them; he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exactly , he is a quaker , with the exception of the peculiar dress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - has he any friends? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one only . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is his name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lord wilmore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where is he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is in paris just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - important ones; he was in india with zaccone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know his abode? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s somewhere in the chausse d antin; but i know neither the street nor the number . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i love zaccone , and he hates him; we are consequently not friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to that question i can answer positively; no , sir , he had not , because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required , and as i did not know when i might again come to paris , i recommended m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - andrea? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , bartolomeo , his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , sir , i have but one question more to ask , and i charge you , in the name of honor , of humanity , and of religion , to answer me candidly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know with what design m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo purchased a house at auteuil? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , for he told me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to make a lunatic asylum of it , similar to that founded by the count of pisani at palermo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you know about that institution? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have heard of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a magnificent charity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having said this , the abb bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the visitor either understood the abb s meaning , or had no more questions to ask; he arose , and the abb accompanied him to the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are a great almsgiver , said the visitor ,  - and although you are said to be rich , i will venture to offer you something for your poor people; will you accept my offering? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thank you , sir; i am only jealous in one thing , and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - however<s> <s>  - my resolution , sir , is unchangeable , but you have only to search for yourself and you will find , alas , but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb once more bowed as he opened the door , the stranger bowed and took his leave , and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered , and this time it went to the rue fontaine - saint - georges , and stopped at no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 5 , where lord wilmore lived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten , he was told that lord wilmore , who was precision and punctuality personified , was not yet come in , but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after ten minutes  expectation the clock struck ten; at the fifth stroke the door opened and lord wilmore appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was rather above the middle height , with thin reddish whiskers , light complexion and light hair , turning rather gray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his first remark on entering was: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know , sir , i do not speak french? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know you do not like to converse in our language , replied the envoy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you may use it , replied lord wilmore;  - i understand it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i , replied the visitor , changing his idiom ,  - know enough of english to keep up the conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - aw? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the envoy presented his letter of introduction , which the latter read with english coolness , and having finished: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i understand , said he ,  - perfectly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then began the questions , which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abb busoni . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as lord wilmore , in the character of the count s enemy , was less restrained in his answers , they were more numerous; he described the youth of monte cristo , who he said , at ten years of age , entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was there wilmore had first met him and fought against him; and in that war zaccone had been taken prisoner , sent to england , and consigned to the hulks , whence he had escaped by swimming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then began his travels , his duels , his caprices; then the insurrection in greece broke out , and he had served in the grecian ranks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly , but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after the battle of navarino , when the greek government was consolidated , he asked of king otho a mining grant for that district , which was given him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hence that immense fortune , which , in lord wilmore s opinion , possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum ,a precarious fortune , which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is speculating in railways , said lord wilmore ,  - and as he is an expert chemist and physicist , he has invented a new system of telegraphy , which he is seeking to bring to perfection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the prefect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you wish to know why he bought it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count is a speculator , who will certainly ruin himself in experiments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at bagnres , luchon , and cauterets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , as i dislike him , and hope his railway , his electric telegraph , or his search for baths , will ruin him , i am watching for his discomfiture , which must soon take place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what was the cause of your quarrel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why do you not seek revenge? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what was the result of those duels? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the first time , he broke my arm; the second , he wounded me in the breast; and the third time , made this large wound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the englishman turned down his shirt - collar , and showed a scar , whose redness proved it to be a recent one . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms , after giving her orders , many guests were arriving , more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count; for , owing to the good taste of mercds , one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing , or even copying in case of need . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied madame danglars ,  - i am too ill . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - madame , said albert ,  - allow me to present to you m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian morrel , captain of spahis , one of our best , and , above all , of our bravest officers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil , at the house of the count of monte cristo , replied madame de villefort , turning away with marked coldness of manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not the coat , unexceptional in its cut , though simple and unornamented; it was not the plain white waistcoat; it was not the trousers , that displayed the foot so perfectly formedit was none of these things that attracted the attention ,it was his pale complexion , his waving black hair , his calm and serene expression , his dark and melancholy eye , his mouth , chiselled with such marvellous delicacy , which so easily expressed such high disdain ,these were what fixed the attention of all upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many men might have been handsomer , but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant , if the expression may be used . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything about the count seemed to have its meaning , for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face , and even to the most trifling gesture , scarcely to be understood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet the parisian world is so strange , that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de morcerf , who , standing before a mantle - piece ornamented with flowers , had seen his entrance in a looking - glass placed opposite the door , and was prepared to receive him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you seen my mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo;  - and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should not have guessed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and for what kind of talent are they celebrated? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that tall , harsh - looking man is very learned , he discovered , in the neighborhood of rome , a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have , and he immediately laid his discovery before the institute . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thing was discussed for a long time , but finally decided in his favor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world , and the gentleman , who was only a knight of the legion of honor , was made an officer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said monte cristo ,  - this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i suppose , had he found another additional vertebra , they would have made him a commander . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very likely , said albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , that coat is not his own idea; it is the republic s , which deputed david[12] to devise a uniform for the academicians . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo;  - so this gentleman is an academician? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his talent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and he is made a member of the academy of sciences for this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what has the french academy to do with all this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was going to tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; that his style of writing is very good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins , to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red , and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , the third . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was very successful upon that question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stood badly with the liberal papers , but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they talk of making him an ambassador . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what are his claims to the peerage? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has composed two or three comic operas , written four or five articles in the sicle , and voted five or six years on the ministerial side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now you will do me a favor , will you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish it , you will warn me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just then the count felt his arm pressed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned round; it was danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why do you call me baron? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars;  - you know that i care nothing for my title . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not like you , viscount; you like your title , do you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , replied albert ,  - seeing that without my title i should be nothing; while you , sacrificing the baron , would still remain the millionaire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july , replied danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; i received the news this evening by a courier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed danglars ,  - they have drawn on me for 200 ,000 francs! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per cent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , but it is too late , said danglars ,  - i have honored their bills . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said monte cristo ,  - here are 200 ,000 francs gone after<s> <s>  - hush , do not mention these things , said danglars; then , approaching monte cristo , he added ,  - especially before young m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert had left the count to speak to his mother , danglars to converse with young cavalcanti; monte cristo was for an instant alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead , but drew back when the waiter was presented to him; he took no refreshment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de morcerf did not lose sight of monte cristo; she saw that he took nothing , and even noticed his gesture of refusal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - albert , she asked ,  - did you notice that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but your house is not m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf s , murmured mercds;  - and since he has been here i have watched him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , he has taken nothing yet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count is very temperate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but why , mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just to please me , albert , said mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another salver passed , loaded like the preceding ones; she saw albert attempt to persuade the count , but he obstinately refused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert rejoined his mother; she was very pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said she ,  - you see he refuses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but why need this annoy you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know , albert , women are singular creatures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should like to have seen the count take something in my house , if only an ice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps he cannot reconcile himself to the french style of living , and might prefer something else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no; i have seen him eat of everything in italy; no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not think that , for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated , and asked why the venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she left the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open , and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns , and the supper laid under the tent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dancers , players , talkers , all uttered an exclamation of joyeveryone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not detain those gentlemen here , count , she said;  - they would prefer , i should think , to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here , since they are not playing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said a gallant old general , who , in 1809 , had sung partant pour la syrie , - we will not go alone to the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said mercds ,  - i will lead the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count almost staggered at these simple words; then he fixed his eyes on mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was only a momentary glance , but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century , so much was expressed in that one look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was too warm in the room , was it not , count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , madame; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he ceased speaking , the count felt the hand of mercds tremble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you , he said ,  - with that light dress , and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf , perhaps you feel cold? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know where i am leading you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the countess , without replying to the question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count looked at mercds as if to interrogate her , but she continued to walk on in silence , and he refrained from speaking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they reached the building , ornamented with magnificent fruits , which ripen at the beginning of july in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun , so frequently absent in our climate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the countess left the arm of monte cristo , and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - see , count , she said , with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids - see , our french grapes are not to be compared , i know , with yours of sicily and cyprus , but you will make allowance for our northern sun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count bowed , but stepped back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pray excuse me , madame , replied monte cristo ,  - but i never eat muscatel grapes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds let them fall , and sighed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall , ripened by the same artificial heat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds drew near , and plucked the fruit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take this peach , then , she said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count again refused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she exclaimed , in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob;  - really , you pain me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a long silence followed; the peach , like the grapes , fell to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know it , madame , replied the count;  - but we are in france , and not in arabia , and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said the countess , breathlessly , with her eyes fixed on monte cristo , whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands ,  - we are friends , are we not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count became pale as death , the blood rushed to his heart , and then again rising , dyed his cheeks with crimson; his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , we are friends , he replied;  - why should we not be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , she said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and they walked on again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , suddenly exclaimed the countess , after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence ,  - is it true that you have seen so much , travelled so far , and suffered so deeply? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have suffered deeply , madame , answered monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doubtless , replied the count ,  - since no one hears me complain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my present happiness equals my past misery , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the countess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i , married? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed monte cristo , shuddering;  - who could have told you so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no one told me you were , but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a young and lovely woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you live alone , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have no sisterno sonno father? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have no one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not my fault , madame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at malta , i loved a young girl , was on the point of marrying her , when war came and carried me away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me , and even to remain faithful to my memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i returned she was married . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the countess stopped for a moment , as if gasping for breath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never returned to the country where she lived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; malta . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is , then , now at malta? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hate them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the countess placed herself before monte cristo , still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take some , she said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame , i never eat muscatel grapes , replied monte cristo , as if the subject had not been mentioned before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket , with a gesture of despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - inflexible man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert at this moment ran in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , mother , he exclaimed ,  - such a misfortune has happened! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what has happened? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the countess , as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life;  - did you say a misfortune? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , i should expect misfortunes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort is here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he comes to fetch his wife and daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because madame de saint - mran is just arrived in paris , bringing the news of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de saint - mran s death , which took place on the first stage after he left marseilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort , who was in very good spirits , would neither believe nor think of the misfortune , but mademoiselle valentine , at the first words , guessed the whole truth , notwithstanding all the precautions of her father; the blow struck her like a thunderbolt , and she fell senseless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and how was m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de saint - mran related to mademoiselle de villefort? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why was not m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - albert , albert , said madame de morcerf , in a tone of mild reproof ,  - what are you saying? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she took two or three steps forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we are friends; are we not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , madame , i do not presume to call myself your friend , but at all times i am your most respectful servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart , and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not my mother and you agree? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked albert , astonished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on the contrary , replied the count ,  - did you not hear her declare that we were friends? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they re - entered the drawing - room , which valentine and madame de villefort had just quitted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after the ladies had departed for the ball , whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them , the procureur had shut himself up in his study , according to his custom , with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else , but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this time the papers were a mere matter of form . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort had secluded himself , not to study , but to reflect; and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business , he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events , the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him , he opened the drawer of his desk , touched a spring , and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda , amongst which he had carefully arranged , in characters only known to himself , the names of all those who , either in his political career , in money matters , at the bar , or in his mysterious love affairs , had become his enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their number was formidable , now that he had begun to fear , and yet these names , powerful though they were , had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences , the almost impassable paths , and the fearful chasms , through which he has so perilously climbed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had run over all these names in his memory , again read and studied them , commenting meanwhile upon his lists , he shook his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , he murmured ,  - none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time , that they might now come and crush me with this secret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> foul deeds will rise , though all the earth o erwhelm them , to men s eyes; <s> <s> but , like a phosphoric light , they rise but to mislead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the story has been told by the corsican to some priest , who in his turn has repeated it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> however , among all the incoherent details given to me by the abb busoni and by lord wilmore , by that friend and that enemy , one thing appears certain and clear in my opinionthat in no period , in no case , in no circumstance , could there have been any contact between him and me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he dreaded not so much the revelation , for he could reply to or deny its truth;he cared little for that mene , mene , tekel upharsin , which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall;but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was endeavoring to calm his fears ,and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams , was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home , in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept ,the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard , then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs , followed by tears and lamentations , such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master s grief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead , and her eyes , already sunken by the furrows of age , now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , sir , she said;  - oh , sir , what a misfortune! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , falling upon the chair nearest the door , she burst into a paroxysm of sobs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servants , standing in the doorway , not daring to approach nearer , were looking at noirtier s old servant , who had heard the noise from his master s room , and run there also , remaining behind the others . </s> </s>

<s> <s> however , as it became dark , and i could no longer see , i fell asleep; i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek , as from a person suffering in his dreams , and he suddenly threw his head back violently . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - god has supported me through all; and then , my dear marquis , he would certainly have done everything for me that i performed for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is on her account i am here; i wish to see valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball; so he only said that she had gone out with her step - mother , and that she should be fetched . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the old lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort placed the arm of madame de saint - mran within his own , and conducted her to his apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , while madame de saint - mran remained on her knees , praying fervently , villefort sent for a cab , and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from madame de morcerf s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , father , some misfortune has happened! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and grandpapa? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the young girl , trembling with apprehension . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at the foot of the stairs , valentine found barrois awaiting her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma , she replied , feeling , with true delicacy , that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint - mran . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de saint - mran heard her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , she said softly to valentine ,  - let her leave; but do you stay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , sir , exclaimed barrois ,  - a great misfortune has happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de saint - mran and noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship; still , the death of one old man always considerably affects another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier let his head fall upon his chest , apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful; then he closed one eye , in token of inquiry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> barrois asked ,  - mademoiselle valentine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier again closed his left eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you wish to see her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier again made an affirmative sign . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , they have gone to fetch her , no doubt , from madame de morcerf s; i will await her return , and beg her to come up here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the invalid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> consequently , valentine came up to noirtier , on leaving madame de saint - mran , who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade , her usual beverage , and a glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , as we have said , the young girl left the bedside to see m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man intimated that such was his meaning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes , happily i have , replied valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child , but wished her good - night , for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - my father? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired valentine , uneasily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i wish to speak to him . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - ah , madame , said villefort ,  - you forget that i was obliged to give a mother to my child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a stepmother is never a mother , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this is not to the purpose ,our business concerns valentine , let us leave the dead in peace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this was said with such exceeding rapidity , that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you would not have me marry under such sad auspices? </s> </s>

<s> <s> valentine screamed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was the fever that disturbed you , madame , said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doubt , if you please , but i am sure of what i say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw a white figure , and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses , i heard my glass removedthe same which is there now on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so little was it a dream , that i stretched my hand towards the bell; but when i did so , the shade disappeared; my maid then entered with a light . </s> </s>

<s> <s> oh , how feverish you are; we must not send for a notary , but for a doctor! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she , shrugging her shoulders ,  - i am not ill; i am thirstythat is all . </s> </s>

<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was thinking of the despair of maximilian , when he should be informed that madame de saint - mran , instead of being an ally , was unconsciously acting as his enemy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it , by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so; for , were it once discovered by her father and mother , all would be lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two hours passed thus; madame de saint - mran was in a feverish sleep , and the notary had arrived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though his coming was announced in a very low tone , madame de saint - mran arose from her pillow . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - an apoplectic stroke? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband , whom she never left , has called her , and that she must go and join him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where is she? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in her room with the notary . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - and the same love for youeh , my dear child? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who does not love you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine smiled sadly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it must have been delirium; she fancies , too , that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is singular , said the doctor;  - i was not aware that madame de saint - mran was subject to such hallucinations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition , said valentine;  - and this morning she frightened me so that i thought her mad; and my father , who you know is a strong - minded man , himself appeared deeply impressed . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - oh , i dare notshe forbade my sending for you; and , as you say , i am myself agitated , feverish and out of sorts . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the doctor pressed valentine s hand , and while he visited her grandmother , she descended the steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house , and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair , she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench; then from the bench she went to the gate . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she stopped astonished , then the voice reached her ear more distinctly , and she recognized it to be that of maximilian . </s> </s>

<s> <s> perhaps i turned pale and trembled , but certainly i smiled; and five minutes after i left , without having heard one word that had passed . </s> </s>

<s> <s> what do you intend doing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , said morrel;  - it is not the first time you have contemplated our present position , which is a serious and urgent one; i do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow; leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are such in the world , and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth , but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment , but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes . </s> </s>

<s> <s> valentine trembled , and looked at him with amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the idea of resisting her father , her grandmother , and all the family , had never occurred to her . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - do not appeal to me , mademoiselle; i shall be a bad judge in such a case; my selfishness will blind me , replied morrel , whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing desperation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not for me to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are wrong; you must advise me what to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - valentine , said morrel pushing aside a loose plank ,  - give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger; my senses are confused , and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said valentine , raising her eyes to heaven and sighing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am free , replied maximilian ,  - and rich enough to support you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you make me tremble! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will embark for algiers , for england , for america , or , if you prefer it , retire to the country and only return to paris when our friends have reconciled your family . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - mademoiselle , replied morrel with a bitter smile ,  - i am selfishyou have already said soand as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation , but of what i intend doing myself . </s> </s>

<s> <s> franz had been to announce the ceremony , and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him; the death of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint - mran , who had left her bed to receive him , but had been obliged to return to it immediately after . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is easy to suppose that morrel s agitation would not escape the count s penetrating eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo was more affectionate than ever ,indeed , his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine , and kept his secret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man read valentine s letter twenty times in the course of the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was her first , and on what an occasion! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she becomes at once a queen and a wife , and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say ,  - here i am , maximilian; come and help me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had arranged everything for her escape; two ladders were hidden in the clover - field; a cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone , without a servant , without lights; at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps , as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> occasionally he shuddered; he thought of the moment when , from the top of that wall , he should protect the descent of his dear valentine , pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near , he wished for solitude , his agitation was extreme; a simple question from a friend would have irritated him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shut himself in his room , and tried to read , but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word , and he threw away the book , and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan , the ladders and the fence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length the hour drew near . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half - past six . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then said ,  - it is time to start; the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o clock , but perhaps valentine will not wait for that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> consequently , morrel , having left the rue meslay at half - past eight by his timepiece , entered the clover - field while the clock of saint - philippe - du - roule was striking eight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin , where morrel had often waited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the night gradually drew on , and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then morrel came out from his hiding - place with a beating heart , and looked through the small opening in the gate; there was yet no one to be seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the garden became darker still , but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress , and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the house , which was discernible through the trees , remained in darkness , and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriage - contract was going on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was already half an hour past the time valentine had fixed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a terrible moment for the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> amidst all these alternations of hope and fear , the clock struck ten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is impossible , said maximilian ,  - that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have weighed all the chances , calculated the time required for all the forms; something must have happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then he walked rapidly to and fro , and pressed his burning forehead against the fence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had valentine fainted? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in that case , said he ,  - i should lose her , and by my own fault . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance; he ventured to call , and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last the half - hour struck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was impossible to wait longer , his temples throbbed violently , his eyes were growing dim; he passed one leg over the wall , and in a moment leaped down on the other side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what might be the consequences? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he followed a short distance close under the wall , then crossed a path , hid entered a clump of trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a moment he had passed through them , and could see the house distinctly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of lights at every window , as is customary on days of ceremony , he saw only a gray mass , which was veiled also by a cloud , which at that moment obscured the moon s feeble light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these three windows were in madame de saint - mran s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de villefort s bedroom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel guessed all this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentine s absence had done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> almost mad with grief , and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more , and be certain of the misfortune he feared , morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees , and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower - garden , when the sound of a voice , still at some distance , but which was borne upon the wind , reached him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it , and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps , followed by a gentleman in black . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man , seeing them approach , drew back mechanically , until he found himself stopped by a sycamore - tree in the centre of the clump; there he was compelled to remain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon the two gentlemen stopped also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , my dear doctor , said the procureur ,  - heaven declares itself against my house! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a dreadful deathwhat a blow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dead , dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cold sweat sprang to the young man s brow , and his teeth chattered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , replied the doctor , with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man ,  - i have not led you here to console you; on the contrary<s> <s>  - what can you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the procureur , alarmed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can it be possible? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured villefort , clasping his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort fell , rather than seated himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor stood before him , with one hand placed on his shoulder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , horrified , supported his head with one hand , and with the other pressed his heart , lest its beatings should be heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dead , dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame de saint - mran was , doubtless , advancing in years , but she enjoyed excellent health . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - were you present during the last struggle? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was , replied the procureur;  - you begged me not to leave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame de saint - mran has fallen a victim? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you arrived , madame de saint - mran had already been panting for breath some minutes; she then had a fit , which i took to be simply a nervous attack , and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed , and her limbs and neck appear stiffened , that i became really alarmed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you held her handyou were feeling her pulseand the second fit came on before you had turned towards me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was more terrible than the first; the same nervous movements were repeated , and the mouth contracted and turned purple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and at the third she expired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus; you confirmed my opinion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , spare me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as a friend , and only as a friend , at this moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and to that friend i say , during the three - quarters of an hour that the struggle continued , i watched the convulsions and the death of madame de saint - mran , and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison , but i could also specify the poison . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - can it be possible? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the symptoms are marked , do you see? sleep broken by nervous spasms , excitation of the brain , torpor of the nerve centres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort seized the doctor s hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , it is impossible , said he ,  - i must be dreaming! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , i entreat you , my dear doctor , that you may be deceived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doubtless i may , but<s> <s>  - but? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i do not think so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so many dreadful things have happened to me lately that i am on the verge of madness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - has anything been sent for from a chemist s that i have not examined? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - had madame de saint - mran any enemies? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - would her death affect anyone s interest? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , if such a thought could present itself , i would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , my dear friend , said m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for my father? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but how could a dose prepared for m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier poison madame de saint - mran? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing is more simple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , i resolved to try one last means , and for three months i have been giving him brucine; so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six grains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , which has become gradually accustomed to it , would be sufficient to kill another person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear doctor , there is no communication between m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s apartment and that of madame de saint - mran , and barrois never entered my mother - in - law s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world , and although i place the utmost reliance in you , i want , notwithstanding my conviction , to believe this axiom , errare humanum est . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why do you ask me that? what do you wish? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - send for him; i will tell him what i have seen , and we will consult together , and examine the body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i did not say of poison , but we can prove what was the state of the body; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death , and we shall say , dear villefort , if this thing has been caused by negligence , watch over your servants; if from hatred , watch your enemies . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - what do you propose to me , d avrigny? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said villefort in despair;  - so soon as another is admitted into our secret , an inquest will become necessary; and an inquest in my houseimpossible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , continued the procureur , looking at the doctor with uneasiness ,  - if you wish itif you demand it , why then it shall be done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , doctor , you see me already so grievedhow can i introduce into my house so much scandal , after so much sorrow? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my wife and my daughter would die of it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pardon me , doctor , these worldly ideas; were you a priest i should not dare tell you that , but you are a man , and you know mankind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , replied the doctor ,  - my first duty is to humanity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would have saved madame de saint - mran , if science could have done it; but she is dead and my duty regards the living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts; i am willing , if anyone should suspect this , that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile , sir , watch alwayswatch carefully , for perhaps the evil may not stop here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , as if he feared doctor d avrigny would recall his promise , he hurried him towards the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful , but most terrible manner , said he;  - but valentine , poor girl , how will she bear so much sorrow? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he thought thus , he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the light had almost disappeared from the former; doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp , and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the extremity of the building , on the contrary , he saw one of the three windows open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a wax - light placed on the mantle - piece threw some of its pale rays without , and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although it was impossible that valentine should see him , hidden as he was , he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him; his disturbed mind told him so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine had not seen him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile , morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase , which , being carpeted , prevented his approach being heard , and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort even would not have alarmed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was quite prepared for any such encounter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would at once approach valentine s father and acknowledge all , begging villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving hearts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel was mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> happily he did not meet anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned back , a door partly open enabled him to see his road , and to hear the voice of one in sorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he pushed the door open and entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the other end of the room , under a white sheet which covered it , lay the corpse , still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler , and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel could not resist this; he was not exemplary for piety , he was not easily impressed , but valentine suffering , weeping , wringing her hands before him , was more than he could bear in silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sighed , and whispered a name , and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chaira head like that of a magdalen by correggiowas raised and turned towards him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel held out his hand to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine , as her only apology for not having met him , pointed to the corpse under the sheet , and began to sob again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> neither dared for some time to speak in that room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose; at length valentine ventured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas , i would say you are welcome , had not death opened the way for you into this house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - valentine , said morrel with a trembling voice ,  - i had waited since half - past eight , and did not see you come; i became uneasy , leaped the wall , found my way through the garden , when voices conversing about the fatal event<s> <s>  - what voices? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands , the stiff neck , and the purple lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your servants , said he ,  - who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story; from them i learned it all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here , love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - forgive me , replied morrel;  - i will go away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but if anyone should come here<s> <s> the young girl shook her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what has become of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy; for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what redoubles my sorrow , continued the young girl , as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment ,  - is that the poor old lady , on her death - bed , requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible; she also , thinking to protect me , was acting against me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hark! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they both listened; steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to accompany the doctor to the door , added morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how do you know it is the doctor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i imagined it must be , said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine looked at the young man; they heard the street door close , then m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort locked the garden door , and returned upstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stopped a moment in the anteroom , as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint - mran s; morrel concealed himself behind a door; valentine remained motionless , grief seeming to deprive her of all fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is but one way left you that is safe , said she;  - it is through my grandfather s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to my grandfather s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i in m . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i have long wished it; he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help ,come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said valentine;  - and i have but one scruple ,that of leaving my dear grandmother s remains , which i had undertaken to watch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said valentine;  - besides , it will not be for long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she passed first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man , and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she hurriedly ,  - you know poor grandmamma died an hour since , and now i have no friend in the world but you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to you alone , then , may i confide my sorrows and my hopes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine took maximilian s hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he brings an irreproachable name , which maximilian is likely to render glorious , since at thirty years of age he is a captain , an officer of the legion of honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man signified that he recollected him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , grandpapa , said valentine , kneeling before him , and pointing to maximilian ,  - i love him , and will be only his; were i compelled to marry another , i would destroy myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you like m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel , as if to say ,  - perhaps i may . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mademoiselle , said he ,  - you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmother s room , will you allow me the honor of a few minutes  conversation with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is it , said the old man s eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you fear he will not understand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine arose , placed a chair for morrel , requested barrois not to admit anyone , and having tenderly embraced her grandfather , and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel , she went away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but first , said morrel ,  - allow me , sir , to tell you who i am , how much i love mademoiselle valentine , and what are my designs respecting her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier made a sign that he would listen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel , who began his story with trembling . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - this was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate , in which i intended to carry off valentine to my sister s house , to marry her , and to wait respectfully m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort s pardon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you do not sanction our project? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is another way , said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man s interrogative eye said ,  - which? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will go , continued maximilian ,  - i will seek m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s look continued to interrogate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will find him , as i told you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morrel;  - you disapprove of this second project , as you did of the first? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do , signified the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame de saint - mran s last request was , that the marriage might not be delayed; must i let things take their course? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier did not move . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but delay may ruin our plan , sir , replied the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am here almost miraculously , and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> believe me , there are only the two plans i have proposed to you; forgive my vanity , and tell me which you prefer . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - from you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you thoroughly understand me , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will our help come from you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are sure of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer , no one could , at any rate , doubt his will , if they did his power . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , thank you a thousand times! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but how , unless a miracle should restore your speech , your gesture , your movement , how can you , chained to that armchair , dumb and motionless , oppose this marriage? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a smile lit up the old man s face , a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but the contract? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same smile returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you assure me it shall not be signed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the contract shall not be signed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said the paralytic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> notwithstanding that assurance , morrel still hesitated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it not natural that the madman , ignorant of his folly , should attempt things beyond his power? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the weak man talks of burdens he can raise , the timid of giants he can confront , the poor of treasures he spends , the most humble peasant , in the height of his pride , calls himself jupiter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you wish , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel;  - that i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s eye remained fixed and firm , as if to imply that a promise did not suffice; then it passed from his face to his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he extended his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is right , said the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said morrel ,  - do you wish me to retire? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - without seeing mademoiselle valentine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s expression could not be understood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he bowed a second time and retired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found outside the door the old servant , to whom valentine had given directions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel was conducted along a dark passage , which led to a little door opening on the garden , soon found the spot where he had entered , with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall , and by his ladder was in an instant in the clover - field where his cabriolet was still waiting for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two days after , a considerable crowd was assembled , towards ten o clock in the morning , around the door of m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was a kind of covered wagon , painted black , and was one of the first to arrive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquiry was made , and it was ascertained that , by a strange coincidence , this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de saint - mran , and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i saw madame de saint - mran only last year at marseilles , when i was coming back from algiers , said chteau - renaud;  - she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old , from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how old was she? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - franz assured me , replied albert ,  - that she was sixty - six years old . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she has not died of old age , but of grief; it appears that since the death of the marquis , which affected her very deeply , she has not completely recovered her reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is said to have been a congestion of the brain , or apoplexy , which is the same thing , is it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nearly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame de saint - mran , whom i once saw , was short , of slender form , and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint - mran . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , or rather , mademoiselle valentine ,or , still rather , our friend franz , inherits a magnificent fortune , amounting , i believe , to 80 ,000 livres per annum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin , noirtier . </s> </s>

<s> <s> take the republic for a tutor; let us return with renewed strength to the battle - field , and i promise you 500 ,000 soldiers , another marengo , and a second austerlitz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one thing only puzzles me , namely , how franz d pinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but where is franz? </s> </s>

<s> <s> they arrived in about an hour at the cemetery; the weather was mild , but dull , and in harmony with the funeral ceremony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> among the groups which flocked towards the family vault , chteau - renaud recognized morrel , who had come alone in a cabriolet , and walked silently along the path bordered with yew - trees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how is it that i have never met you at his house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am no acquaintance of m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> albert came up to them at this moment with franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the time and place are but ill - suited for an introduction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert;  - but we are not superstitious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , allow me to present to you m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz d pinay , a delightful travelling companion , with whom i made the tour of italy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear franz , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian morrel , an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence , and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection , wit , or amiability . </s> </s>

<s> <s> said debray to franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - extremely , replied he;  - she looked so pale this morning , i scarcely knew her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took the arm of chteau - renaud , and turned towards the vault , where the attendants had already placed the two coffins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is a magnificent habitation , said beauchamp , looking towards the mausoleum;  - a summer and winter palace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will , in turn , enter it , my dear d pinay , for you will soon be numbered as one of the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in dying , i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron: eo rus , and all will be over . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - but tell me , said beauchamp ,  - what is life? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it not a halt in death s anteroom? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am prejudiced against beauchamp , said albert , drawing franz away , and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here were not , as in other tombs , ignoble drawers , one above another , where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum; all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy - looking room , separated by a wall from the vault itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall , and enclosed the villefort and saint - mran coffins . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the right - hand crypt belonging to the saint - mran family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door , and there was no address given , the party all separated; chteau - renaud , albert , and morrel , went one way , and debray and beauchamp the other . </s> </s>

<s> <s> noirtier towards his grandchild , and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me hasten to add , continued he ,  - that the testator , having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune , and having alienated it all , the will will not bear scrutiny , and is declared null and void . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay , that during my life - time my father s will shall never be questioned , my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said franz ,  - i regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of mademoiselle valentine; i have never inquired the amount of her fortune , which , however limited it may be , exceeds mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort; all i seek is happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine imperceptibly thanked him , while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks . </s> </s>

<s> <s> de villefort followed them . </s> </s>

<s> <s> noirtier answered only by a look which made villefort s blood run cold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he motioned to valentine to approach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a moment , thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather , she understood that he asked for a key . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she opened the drawer , and found a key; and , understanding that was what he wanted , again watched his eyes , which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall i open the secretaire? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said the old man . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - shall i call him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old servant came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - barrois , said valentine ,  - my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire , but there is a secret spring in it , which you knowwill you open it? </s> </s>

<s> <s> franz took them from barrois and casting a glance at the cover , read: </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - read , said the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz untied it , and in the midst of the most profound silence read: </s> </s>

 <s> <s> franz stopped . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at nine o clock the president of the club presented himself; the general was ready , the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting , and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged , swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> general de quesnel accepted the condition , and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the general s carriage was ready , but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it , since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what must be done then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> - i have my carriage here , said the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - have you , then , so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - then we run another risk , said the general , laughing ,  - that of being upset . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sure enough , said the general . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint - jacques . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the general alighted , leaning on the arm of the president , of whose dignity he was not aware , considering him simply as a member of the club; they went through the alley , mounted a flight of stairs , and entered the assembly - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the deliberations had already begun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage , he did so immediately , and was surprised to see so many well - known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - and hence , said villefort ,  - arose my affection for your father , my dear m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> opinions held in common are a ready bond of union . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - read again , said the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz continued: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was then informed of the contents of the letter from the island of elba , in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the reading was finished , he remained silent , with knitted brows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - well , asked the president ,  - what do you say to this letter , general? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to break my vow in behalf of the ex - emperor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - general , said the president ,  - we acknowledge no king louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - excuse me , gentlemen , said the general;  - you may not acknowledge louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , but i do , as he has made me a baron and a field - marshal , and i shall never forget that for these two titles i am indebted to his happy return to france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - sir , said the president , rising with gravity ,  - be careful what you say; your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the island of elba , and have deceived us! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you , and which does you honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will not constrain you to help us; we enroll no one against his conscience , but we will compel you to act generously , even if you are not disposed to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see i am more candid than you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - ah , my father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said franz , interrupting himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i understand now why they murdered him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man , whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort walked to and fro behind them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier watched the expression of each one , and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - sir , said the president ,  - you have been invited to join this assemblyyou were not forced here; it was proposed to you to come blindfoldedyou accepted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , or we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - i am a royalist , replied the general;  - i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis xviii . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , and i will adhere to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these words were followed by a general murmur , and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the president again arose , and having imposed silence , said , - sir , you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation , and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the general , putting his hand on his sword , exclaimed , - if you talk of honor , do not begin by disavowing its laws , and impose nothing by violence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - and you , sir , continued the president , with a calmness still more terrible than the general s anger ,  - i advise you not to touch your sword . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - then you must die , replied the president calmly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay became very pale; he looked round him a second time , several members of the club were whispering , and getting their arms from under their cloaks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - general , said the president ,  - do not alarm yourself; you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity , but as you have said , you are among conspirators , you are in possession of our secret , and you must restore it to us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the same deadly silence succeeded these words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the general advanced , and making a violent effort to control his feelings , - i have a son , said he ,  - and i ought to think of him , finding myself among assassins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - general , said the chief of the assembly ,  - one man may insult fiftyit is the privilege of weakness . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  -  - it is this:i swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the 5th of february , 1815 , between nine and ten o clock in the evening; and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor , which prevented his answering for some moments; then , overcoming his manifest repugnance , he pronounced the required oath , but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members , who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly , which he did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - now am i at liberty to retire? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the general . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other members silently dispersed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - beware , sir , replied the president ,  - you are no longer in the assembly , and have only to do with individuals; do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but instead of listening , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay went on , - you are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the president stopped the coach . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - why do you stop here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked d pinay . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  -  - another method of assassination? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the general , shrugging his shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  - make no noise , sir , unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards , who take their weakness for a shield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are alone , one alone shall answer you; you have a sword by your side , i have one in my cane; you have no witness , one of these gentlemen will serve you . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it was , as we said , the fifth of february . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the general was stout and tall , the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two witnesses followed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a dark night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost , the water of the river looked black and deep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal - barge near , and by its light they examined the weapons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the president s sword , which was simply , as he had said , one he carried in his cane , was five inches shorter than the general s , and had no guard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the general proposed to cast lots for the swords , but the president said it was he who had given the provocation , and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lantern was placed on the ground , the two adversaries took their stations , and the duel began . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning; as for the men , they were scarcely perceptible , the darkness was so great . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - general d pinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army , but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general , and he rushed on his adversary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged , and then returned to the charge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the third he fell again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they thought he slipped , as at first , and the witnesses , seeing he did not move , approached and endeavored to raise him , but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said he ,  - they have sent some fencing - master to fight with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the president , without answering , approached the witness who held the lantern , and raising his sleeve , showed him two wounds he had received in his arm; then opening his coat , and unbuttoning his waistcoat , displayed his side , pierced with a third wound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still he had not even uttered a sigh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> general d pinay died five minutes after . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible , and then stopped , passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud; but after a moment s silence , he continued: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the president went up the steps , after pushing his sword into his cane; a track of blood on the snow marked his course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in proof of this we have signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts , lest the moment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws of honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - signed , beaurepaire , duchampy , and lecharpal . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when franz had finished reading this account , so dreadful for a son; when valentine , pale with emotion , had wiped away a tear; when villefort , trembling , and crouched in a corner , had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man ,<s> <s>  - sir , said d pinay to noirtier ,  - since you are well acquainted with all these details , which are attested by honorable signatures ,since you appear to take some interest in me , although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow , refuse me not one final satisfactiontell me the name of the president of the club , that i may at least know who killed my father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door; valentine , who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather s answer , and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm , drew back a few steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mademoiselle , said franz , turning towards valentine ,  - unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine remained dumb and motionless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hold , sir , said villefort ,  - do not prolong this dreadful scene . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , misery , cried franz:  - the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing , at least , the name of him who killed my father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sir , sir , cried he , turning to noirtier ,  - do what you canmake me understand in some way! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried franz ,  - your grandfather says he can indicate the person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier looked at the dictionary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz took it with a nervous trembling , and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively , until he came to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at that letter the old man signified  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man s finger , glided over the words , but at each one noirtier answered by a negative sign . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine hid her head between her hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , franz arrived at the word myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtieryou killed my father? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied noirtier , fixing a majestic look on the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service , not in the army of his majesty the emperor of austria , but at the gaming - table of the baths of lucca , of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was now fairly launched in that parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners , and treats them , not as they really are , but as they wish to be considered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , what is required of a young man in paris? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to speak its language tolerably , to make a good appearance , to be a good gamester , and to pay in cash . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea had , then , in a fortnight , attained a very fair position . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was called count , he was said to possess 50 ,000 livres per annum; and his father s immense riches , buried in the quarries of saravezza , were a constant theme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers , when monte cristo went one evening to pay m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars a visit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars was out , but the count was asked to go and see the baroness , and he accepted the invitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was never without a nervous shudder , since the dinner at auteuil , and the events which followed it , that madame danglars heard monte cristo s name announced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her; besides , the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested enduseless injury is repugnant to every mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when monte cristo entered the boudoir , to which we have already once introduced our readers , and where the baroness was examining some drawings , which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti , his presence soon produced its usual effect , and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count , although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter took in the whole scene at a glance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti , dressed in black , like one of goethe s heroes , with varnished shoes and white silk open - worked stockings , passed a white and tolerably nice - looking hand through his light hair , and so displayed a sparkling diamond , that in spite of monte cristo s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mademoiselle danglars was still the samecold , beautiful , and satirical . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not one of these glances , nor one sigh , was lost on her; they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva , which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea cavalcanti s solicitude , his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass , and of manifesting his admiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the banker soon returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo , but the second was for andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for his wife , he bowed to her , as some husbands do to their wives , but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend , until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars to andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair , at the piano , accompanying themselves , each with one hand , a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves , and performed admirably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mademoiselle d armilly , whom they then perceived through the open doorway , formed with eugnie one of the tableaux vivants of which the germans are so fond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was somewhat beautiful , and exquisitely formeda little fairy - like figure , with large curls falling on her neck , which was rather too long , as perugino sometimes makes his virgins , and her eyes dull from fatigue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum; it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle d armilly , of whom he had heard much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the banker to his daughter ,  - are we then all to be excluded? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then led the young man into the study , and either by chance or manuvre the door was partially closed after andrea , so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything; but as the banker had accompanied andrea , madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count soon heard andrea s voice , singing a corsican song , accompanied by the piano . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while the count smiled at hearing this song , which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto , madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husband s strength of mind , who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at milan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hem , thought monte cristo ,  - he begins to conceal his losses; a month since he boasted of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then aloud , - oh , madame , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars is so skilful , he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have seen nothing of him the last three or four days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nor i , said madame danglars;  - but you began a sentence , sir , and did not finish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray had told you<s> <s>  - ah , yes; he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was once very fond of it , but i do not indulge now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you are wrong , madame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fortune is precarious; and if i were a woman and fate had made me a banker s wife , whatever might be my confidence in my husband s good fortune , still in speculation you know there is great risk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stay , said monte cristo , as though he had not observed her confusion ,  - i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what has happened? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know the marquis of saint - mran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris , and the marchioness a few days after her arrival? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said monte cristo ,  - i have heard that; but , as claudius said to hamlet , it is a law of nature; their fathers died before them , and they mourned their loss; they will die before their children , who will , in their turn , grieve for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; they were going to marry their daughter<s> <s>  - to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz d pinay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it broken off? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yesterday morning , it appears , franz declined the honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and is the reason known? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and how does m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like a philosopher . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars returned at this moment alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the baroness ,  - do you leave m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti with your daughter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and mademoiselle d armilly , said the banker;  - do you consider her no one? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , turning to monte cristo , he said ,  - prince cavalcanti is a charming young man , is he not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his father was introduced to me as a marquis , so he ought to be a count; but i do not think he has much claim to that title . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if he is a prince , he is wrong not to maintain his rank; i do not like anyone to deny his origin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but do you see to what you are exposing yourself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if , perchance , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti in that room , where he , the betrothed of eugnie , has never been admitted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may well say , perchance , replied the banker;  - for he comes so seldom , it would seem only chance that brings him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert would not do us the honor to be jealous; he does not like eugnie sufficiently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , i care not for his displeasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at his mother s ball he danced once with eugnie , and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti three times , and he took no notice of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the baroness rose hastily , and was going into the study , when danglars stopped her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let her alone , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert entered , looking very handsome and in high spirits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then turning to the baroness:  - may i ask how mademoiselle danglars is? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is quite well , replied danglars quickly;  - she is at the piano with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert retained his calm and indifferent manner; he might feel perhaps annoyed , but he knew monte cristo s eye was on him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice , said he ,  - and mademoiselle eugnie a splendid soprano , and then she plays the piano like thalberg . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they suit each other remarkably well , said danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert appeared not to notice this remark , which was , however , so rude that madame danglars blushed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i , too , said the young man ,  - am a musicianat least , my masters used to tell me so; but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other , and a soprano less than any . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars smiled , and seemed to say ,  - it is of no consequence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , hoping doubtless to effect his purpose , he said , - the prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what prince? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and prince cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle eugnie yesterday? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i was unable to accept your invitation , having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ta , ta , ta , ti , ta , ti , ta , ta; it is charming , let them finishone moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bravo , bravi , brava! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the banker was enthusiastic in his applause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , said albert ,  - it is exquisite; it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti does . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he can easily become one , if he is not already; it is no uncommon thing in italy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to return to the charming musiciansyou should give us a treat , danglars , without telling them there is a stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ask them to sing one more song; it is so delightful to hear music in the distance , when the musicians are unrestrained by observation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars was quite annoyed by the young man s indifference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took monte cristo aside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you think of our lover? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he appears cool . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her , but not to one who does not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hem , said danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the pastthat obscurity on the past . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but that does not affect the son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , i beg of you , don t go off your head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it s a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage , and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me , for it was at my house you met this young cavalcanti , whom i do not really know at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> does not his appearance speak for him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he is very rich . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not so sure of that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fifty thousand livresa mere trifle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is well educated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is a musician . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so are all italians . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , count , you do not do that young man justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i acknowledge it annoys me , knowing your connection with the morcerf family , to see him throw himself in the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you cannot break it off in this way; the morcerfs are depending on this union . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - positively . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then let them explain themselves; you should give the father a hint , you are so intimate with the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i? where the devil did you find out that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at their ball; it was apparent enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , did not the countess , the proud mercds , the disdainful catalane , who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances , take your arm , lead you into the garden , into the private walks , and remain there for half an hour? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , baron , baron , said albert ,  - you are not listeningwhat barbarism in a megalomaniac like you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , don t worry about me , sir mocker , said danglars; then turning to monte cristo he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he demands my daughter let him fix the daydeclare his conditions; in short , let us either understand each other , or quarrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you understandno more delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision , but i do await it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a banker must , you know , be a slave to his promise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti had done half an hour before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried morcerf , parodying the banker , as the selection came to an end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall soon return , said the banker to monte cristo;  - wait for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall , perhaps , have something to say to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the baroness took advantage of her husband s absence to push open the door of her daughter s study , and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea , who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugnie , started up like a jack - in - the - box . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars , who did not appear in the least disturbed , and returned his bow with her usual coolness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars  voice , and on his regret , after what he had just heard , that he had been unable to be present the previous evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , louise , said mademoiselle danglars to her friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just as they were beginning , in the english fashion , to leave the spoons in their cups , the door again opened and danglars entered , visibly agitated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo observed it particularly , and by a look asked the banker for an explanation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have just received my courier from greece , said danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes , said the count;  - that was the reason of your running away from us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how is king otho getting on? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked albert in the most sprightly tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering , and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features , but which was gone in a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we shall go together , shall we not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you like , replied the latter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert could not understand the banker s look , and turning to monte cristo , who understood it perfectly , - did you see , said he ,  - how he looked at me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , i did; and what does he mean by his news from greece? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how can i tell you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo smiled significantly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stop , said albert ,  - here he comes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall compliment mademoiselle danglars on her cameo , while the father talks to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you compliment her at all , let it be on her voice , at least , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , everyone would do that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear viscount , you are dreadfully impertinent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i will tell you all; but take away the young man; i cannot endure his presence . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies , and took their leave , albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars  contempt , monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a banker s wife should exercise in providing for the future . </s> </s>

<s> <s> danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , do you think he is paying his addresses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am certain of it; his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he aspires to the hand of the proud eugnie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what does that signify , so long as they favor your suit? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but it is not the case , my dear count: on the contrary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is so indeed; mademoiselle eugnie scarcely answers me , and mademoiselle d armilly , her confidant , does not speak to me at all . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - do you wish me to do so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the baron himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you surely will not do that , my dear count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said albert , with a sigh ,  - it seems you are determined to marry me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , with the baroness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , with the baron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , that is a good joke! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think he suspects? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo with charming artlessness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where have you come from , my dear count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from congo , if you will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what do i know of your parisian husbands? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but then , what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you will make tea for us , baptistin , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really , my dear count , said morcerf ,  - what i admire in you is , not so much your riches , for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself , nor is it only your wit , for beaumarchais might have possessed as much ,but it is your manner of being served , without any questions , in a moment , in a second; it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing , and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what you say is perhaps true; they know my habits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for instance , you shall see; how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea - time? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in about the space of a second a private door opened , and ali appeared , bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh no , it is as simple as possible , replied monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee; he has heard that i ordered tea , and he also knows that i brought you home with me; when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so , and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking , he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company , and therefore brings two chibouques instead of oneand now the mystery is solved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation , but it is not the less true that youah , but what do i hear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and morcerf inclined his head towards the door , through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi , my dear viscount , you are fated to hear music this evening; you have only escaped from mademoiselle danglars  piano , to be attacked by hayde s guzla . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - haydewhat an adorable name! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are there , then , really women who bear the name of hayde anywhere but in byron s poems? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly there are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , that is charming , said albert ,  - how i should like to hear my countrywomen called mademoiselle goodness , mademoiselle silence , mademoiselle christian charity! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only think , then , if mademoiselle danglars , instead of being called claire - marie - eugnie , had been named mademoiselle chastity - modesty - innocence danglars; what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is very amiable , then , is she not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - undoubtedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really , count , you do nothing , and have nothing like other people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the slave of the count of monte cristo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a hundred thousand francs! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor girl originally possessed much more than that; she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the thousand and one nights would seem but poverty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as regards the generality of mankind it is; but not for you , my dear viscount , who are one of my most intimate friends , and on whose silence i feel i may rely , if i consider it necessary to enjoin itmay i not do so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly; on my word of honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know the history of the pasha of yanina , do you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of ali tepelini? [13] oh , yes; it was in his service that my father made his fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , what is hayde to ali tepelini? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - merely his daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the daughter of ali pasha? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi , yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day , as i was passing through the market at constantinople . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wonderful! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> really , my dear count , you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned; when i listen to you , existence no longer seems reality , but a waking dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request , but<s> <s>  - say on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , since you go out with hayde , and sometimes even take her to the opera<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think i may venture to ask you this favor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will do so; but on two conditions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i accept them at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i give you my oath that i will not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - enough , viscount; you will remember those two vows , will you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count again struck the gong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali reappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , understand me , said the count ,  - no direct questions , my dear morcerf; if you wish to know anything , tell me , and i will ask her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - agreed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali reappeared for the third time , and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door , to signify to his master and albert that they were at liberty to pass on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us go in , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert passed his hand through his hair , and curled his moustache , then , having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance , followed the count into the room , the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hayde was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments , which was the drawing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation , for it was the first time that any man , except monte cristo , had been accorded an entrance into her presence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room , with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion , and seemed to have made for herself , as it were , a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing; it was elegantly fashioned , and worthy of its mistress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on perceiving monte cristo , she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself , expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand , which she as usual raised to her lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert had proceeded no farther than the door , where he remained rooted to the spot , being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty , beheld as it was for the first time , and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whom do you bring? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the young girl in romaic , of monte cristo;  - is it a friend , a brother , a simple acquaintance , or an enemy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a friend , said monte cristo in the same language . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is his name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count albert; it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in what language would you like me to converse with him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know modern greek , asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said hayde , proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristo s question and albert s answer ,  - then i will speak either in french or italian , if my lord so wills it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo reflected one instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will speak in italian , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , turning towards albert , - it is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek , both of which hayde speaks so fluently; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian , which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count made a sign to hayde to address his visitor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , she said to morcerf ,  - you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , turning to ali , she directed him to bring coffee and pipes , and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table , on which were arranged music , drawings , and vases of flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistin , this portion of the building was interdicted to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , take ittake it , said the count;  - hayde is almost as civilized as a parisian; the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her , but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cups of coffee were all prepared , with the addition of sugar , which had been brought for albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo and hayde took the beverage in the original arabian manner , that is to say , without sugar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hayde took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment two women entered , bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet , which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear host , and you , signora , said albert , in italian ,  - excuse my apparent stupidity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am quite bewildered , and it is natural that it should be so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here i am in the heart of paris; but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade - sellers , and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east; not such as i have seen it , but such as my dreams have painted it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , signora , if i could but speak greek , your conversation , added to the fairy - scene which surrounds me , would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you , sir , said hayde quietly;  - and if you like what is eastern , i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on what subject shall i converse with her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert , in a low tone to monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do so then , for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert turned towards hayde . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at what age did you leave greece , signora? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and have you any recollection of your country? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mind can see as well as the body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the body forgets sometimes; but the mind always remembers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and how far back into the past do your recollections extend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i could scarcely walk when my mother , who was called vasiliki , which means royal , said the young girl , tossing her head proudly ,  - took me by the hand , and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed , we went out , both covered with veils , to solicit alms for the prisoners , saying , he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  then when our purse was full we returned to the palace , and without saying a word to my father , we sent it to the convent , where it was divided amongst the prisoners . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and how old were you at that time? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was three years old , said hayde . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , said albert , in a low tone to monte cristo ,  - do allow the signora to tell me something of her history . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you prohibited my mentioning my father s name to her , but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital , and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo turned to hayde , and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words , he said in greek ,  - tell us the fate of your father; but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hayde sighed deeply , and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what are you saying to her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i again reminded her that you were a friend , and that she need not conceal anything from you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said albert ,  - this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance; what is the next? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> under the oldest and thickest of these trees , reclining on cushions , sat my father; my mother was at his feet , and i , childlike , amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle , or with the diamond - hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention , but which he always answered in the same tone of voice , either kill ,  or pardon . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - it is very strange , said albert ,  - to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage , and one needs constantly to be saying to one s self , this is no fiction , it is all reality ,  in order to believe it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and how does france appear in your eyes , accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think it is a fine country , said hayde ,  - but i see france as it really is , because i look on it with the eyes of a woman; whereas my own country , which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind , always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere , which is luminous or otherwise , according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so young , said albert , forgetting at the moment the count s command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself ,  - is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hayde turned her eyes towards monte cristo , who , making at the same time some imperceptible sign , murmured: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood , and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you , all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - speak , speak , signora , said albert ,  - i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hayde answered his remark with a melancholy smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you wish me , then , to relate the history of my past sorrows? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i was but four years old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we were in the palace of yanina; she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping , and on opening my eyes i saw hers filled with tears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she took me away without speaking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hush , child!   said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats , i had with a child s caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined; but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mother s voice when she enjoined me to silence , that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she bore me rapidly away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i saw then that we were descending a large staircase; around us were all my mother s servants carrying trunks , bags , ornaments , jewels , purses of gold , with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you may imagine there was something startling and ominous , said hayde , shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene ,  - in this long file of slaves and women only half - aroused from sleep , or at least so they appeared to me , who was myself scarcely awake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - quick!   said a voice at the end of the gallery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for me , it made me tremble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he came last , clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim , and he drove us all before him , as a shepherd would his straggling flock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father , said hayde , raising her head ,  - was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini , pasha of yanina , and before whom turkey trembled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert , without knowing why , started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent; it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of hayde at this moment; she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre , as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man , to the news of which all europe had listened with horror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - soon , said hayde ,  - we halted on our march , and found ourselves on the borders of a lake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> four marble steps led down to the water s edge , and below them was a boat floating on the tide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass; it was the kiosk to which we were going . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance , perhaps on account of the darkness of the night , which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we stepped into the boat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our bark flew before the wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why does the boat go so fast?   asked i of my mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - silence , child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hush , we are flying!   i did not understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why should my father fly? he , the all - powerfulhe , before whom others were accustomed to flyhe , who had taken for his device ,<s> <s> they hate me; then they fear me!  <s> <s>  - it was , indeed , a flight which my father was trying to effect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of yanina , fatigued with long service<s> <s> here hayde cast a significant glance at monte cristo , whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl then continued , speaking slowly , like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you were saying , signora , said albert , who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital ,  - that the garrison of yanina , fatigued with long service<s> <s>  - had treated with the seraskier[15] kourchid , who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father; it was then that ali tepeliniafter having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he reposed great confidenceresolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself , and which he called kataphygion , or the refuge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and this officer , asked albert ,  - do you remember his name , signora? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert was on the point of pronouncing his father s name , when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach; the young man recollected his promise , and was silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a ground floor , ornamented with arabesques , bathing its terraces in the water , and another floor , looking on the lake , was all which was visible to the eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but beneath the ground floor , stretching out into the island , was a large subterranean cavern , to which my mother , myself , and the women were conducted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i remember well that the slaves , convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives , passed whole days and nights in praying , crying , and groaning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for me , i can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier , and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world , i am quite sure i shall recognize selim . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes , but very rarely , my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace; these were hours of recreation for me , as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selim s fiery lance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon , examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake , while my mother , reclining by his side , rested her head on his shoulder , and i played at his feet , admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves , but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the heights of pindus towered above us; the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake , and the immense masses of black vegetation which , viewed in the distance , gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks , were in reality gigantic fir - trees and myrtles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one morning my father sent for us; my mother had been crying all the night , and was very wretched; we found the pasha calm , but paler than usual . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so?   said my mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , make yourself easy on that head ,  said ali , smiling; selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they would be glad to see me dead , but they would not like themselves to die with me . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - my mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my father s heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking ,for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever ,after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil , and lighted his chibouque , which he sometimes smoked for hours together , quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention , he asked for his telescope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a boat! two! three!   murmured my , father;four!   he then arose , seizing his arms and priming his pistols . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor s answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will not quit you ,  said vasiliki; if you die , my lord , i will die with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go to selim!   cried my father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as for me , i had been forgotten in the general confusion; i ran toward ali tepelini; he saw me hold out my arms to him , and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , how distinctly i remember that kiss! it was the last he ever gave me , and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on descending , we saw through the lattice - work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at first they appeared like black specks , and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during this time , in the kiosk at my father s feet , were seated twenty palikares , concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father looked at his watch , and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> selim was still at his post , and smiled sadly on us as we entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other; and , young as i was , i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on , my child , said the count in the romaic language . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hayde looked up abruptly , as if the sonorous tones of monte cristo s voice had awakened her from a dream; and she resumed her narrative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was about four o clock in the afternoon , and although the day was brilliant out - of - doors , we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my mother was a christian , and she prayed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> selim repeated from time to time the sacred words: god is great!   however , my mother had still some hope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she was coming down , she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople , and in whom my father placed so much confidence; for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are approaching ,  said she; perhaps they bring us peace and liberty!  <s> <s>  - what do you fear , vasiliki?   said selim , in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of dionysus of old crete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[16] but i , being only a little child , was terrified by this undaunted courage , which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless , and i recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my mother experienced the same sensations , for i felt her tremble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mamma , mamma ,  said i , are we really to be killed?   and at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my child ,  said vasiliki , may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread!   then , whispering to selim , she asked what were her master s orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my friend ,  said my mother , when your master s orders arrive , if it is the poniard which he sends , instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread , you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard , will you not?  yes , vasiliki ,  replied selim tranquilly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - suddenly we heard loud cries; and , listening , discerned that they were cries of joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares; it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor , and that it was favorable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morcerf , quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not recollect it , said hayde . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> selim made ready his lance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who are you?   cried selim . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but whoever you may be , i charge you not to advance another step . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> long live the emperor!   said the figure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali , and not only gives him his life , but restores to him his fortune and his possessions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  my mother uttered a cry of joy , and clasped me to her bosom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she fell on her knees , at the same time holding me up towards heaven , as if she desired , while praying to god in my behalf , to raise me actually to his presence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo poured a little iced water into a glass , and presented it to her , saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of command , - courage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hayde dried her eyes , and continued: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i come in the name of our master , ali tepelini . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you come from ali himself ,  said selim , you know what you were charged to remit to me?  yes ,  said the messenger , and i bring you his ring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  at these words he raised his hand above his head , to show the token; but it was too far off , and there was not light enough to enable selim , where he was standing , to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not see what you have in your hand ,  said selim . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> approach then ,  said the messenger , or i will come nearer to you , if you prefer it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be it so ,  said the envoy; and he retired , after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by selim . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , how our hearts palpitated; for it did , indeed , seem to be a ring which was placed there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that was the question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> selim , still holding in his hand the lighted match , walked towards the opening in the cavern , and , aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave , picked up the token . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared , and selim fell , pierced by five blows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each man had stabbed him separately , and , intoxicated by their crime , though still pale with fear , they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire , after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment my mother seized me in her arms , and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves , she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk , where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lower rooms were entirely filled with kourchid s troops; that is to say , with our enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards; i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you see this firman?  i do ,  said my father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , read it; he demands your head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same instant the firing began on the other side , and the balls penetrated the boards all round us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , how noble did the grand vizier my father look at that moment , in the midst of the flying bullets , his scimitar in his hand , and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and how he terrified them , even then , and made them fly before him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> selim , selim!   cried he , guardian of the fire , do your duty!  selim is dead ,  replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth , and you are lost , ali!   at the same moment an explosion was heard , and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atomsthe troops were firing from underneath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three or four palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my father howled aloud , plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made , and tore up one of the planks entire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired , and the flame , rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano , soon reached the tapestry , which it quickly devoured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries , two reports , fearfully distinct , followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all , froze me with terror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my mother tried to force the door , that she might go and die with him , but it was fastened on the inside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i felt myself fall to the ground , my mother had fainted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo arose and approached her , took her hand , and said to her in romaic: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - calm yourself , my dear child , and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , it is nothing , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , patting the young girl on the head , he continued ,  - hayde is very courageous , and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because , my lord , said hayde eagerly ,  - my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert looked at her with curiosity , for she had not yet related what he most desired to know ,how she had become the slave of the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not to me to whom you must address yourself ,  said kourchid . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - who and where is he?  he is here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said albert ,  - you became the property of this man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied hayde ,  - he did not dare to keep us , so we were sold to some slave - merchants who were going to constantinople . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we traversed greece , and arrived half dead at the imperial gates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were surrounded by a crowd of people , who opened a way for us to pass , when suddenly my mother , having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention , uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground , pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates , and beneath which were inscribed these words: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is the head of ali tepelini , pasha of yanina . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i cried bitterly , and tried to raise my mother from the earth , but she was dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he caused me to be instructed , gave me masters , and when i was thirteen years of age he sold me to the sultan mahmoud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of whom i bought her , said monte cristo ,  - as i told you , albert , with the emerald which formed a match to the one i had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you are good , you are great , my lord! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , finish your cup of coffee , said monte cristo;  - the history is ended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of franz when he quitted the chamber of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , even she would have been constrained to pity him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - after all the disclosures which were made this morning , m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning , should not have anticipated him in this announcement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment , so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances , would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance; although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor , or rather rudeness , so far as to relate such a history . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject , had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort , so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel , or the baron d pinay , as he was alternately styled , according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name , or by the title which had been conferred on him , fell the victim of assassination , and not that he was killed fairly in a duel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort s communications on the subject were very limited and concise; he told her , in fact , that an explanation had taken place between m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d pinay , and himself , and that the marriage of valentine and franz would consequently be broken off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit , the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this news , false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred , evidently astonished the auditors , and they retired without a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during this time valentine , at once terrified and happy , after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable , asked leave to retire to her own room , in order to recover her composure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but instead of going to her own room , valentine , having once gained her liberty , entered the gallery , and , opening a small door at the end of it , found herself at once in the garden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other , an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentine s mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear , pale and trembling , to forbid the signing of the contract , like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he followed m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference; he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover - patch , prepared to hear the result of the proceedings , and very certain that valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was not mistaken; peering through the crevices of the wooden partition , he soon discovered the young girl , who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - saved? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated morrel , not being able to conceive such intense happiness;  - by whom? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by my grandfather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , morrel , pray love him for all his goodness to us! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel swore to love him with all his soul; and at that moment he could safely promise to do so , for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father , he worshiped him as a god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but tell me , valentine , how has it all been effected? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at some future time i will tell you all about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but when will that be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel , that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose , and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine again the next night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed , madame de villefort had gone to visit m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said she ,  - it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentine s marriage is broken off , since it was here that the affair was concluded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s countenance remained immovable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but one thing i can tell you , of which i do not think you are aware; that is , that i have always been opposed to this marriage , and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier regarded his daughter - in - law with the look of a man desiring an explanation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now that this marriage , which i know you so much disliked , is done away with , i come to you on an errand which neither m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s eyes demanded the nature of her mission . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i come to entreat you , sir , continued madame de villefort ,  - as the only one who has the right of doing so , inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction ,i come to entreat you to restore , not your love , for that she has always possessed , but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a doubtful expression in noirtier s eyes; he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding , and he could not succeed in doing so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier made a sign that they did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in that case , sir , rejoined madame de villefort ,  - i will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier and retired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier sent for the notary; the first will was torn up and a second made , in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine , on condition that she should never be separated from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort , the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of saint - mran , had regained the good graces of her grandfather , and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300 ,000 livres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriage - contract were being carried on at the house of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf , who , in order to lose no time in responding to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the first sight of his old friend , danglars assumed his majestic air , and settled himself in his easy - chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morcerf , usually so stiff and formal , accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner , and , feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received , he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manuvres in order to gain his end , but went at once straight to the point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , baron , said he ,  - here i am at last; some time has elapsed since our plans were formed , and they are not yet executed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morcerf paused at these words , quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of danglars , and which he attributed to his silence; but , on the contrary , to his great surprise , it grew darker and darker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said morcerf ,  - i see you are a stickler for forms , my dear sir , and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ma foi , i beg your pardon , but as i have but one son , and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him , i am still serving my apprenticeship , you know; come , i will reform . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and morcerf with a forced smile arose , and , making a low bow to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - baron , i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugnie danglars for my son , the vicomte albert de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but danglars , instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected , knit his brow , and without inviting the count , who was still standing , to take a seat , he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur , it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to reflect? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not understand you , baron , said morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a play? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , for it is like one; pray let us come more to the point , and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have seen m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see him very often , said danglars , drawing himself up;  - he is a particular friend of mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , in one of your late conversations with him , you said that i appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage , did you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did say so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , here i am , proving at once that i am really neither the one nor the other , by entreating you to keep your promise on that score . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it , the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage , turned to morcerf , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - these are all so many empty words , my dear sir , said morcerf:  - they might satisfy a new acquaintance , but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list; and when a man like him comes to another , recalls to him his plighted word , and this man fails to redeem the pledge , he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean to say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i mean to say that i have a good reason , but that it is difficult to explain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must be aware , at all events , that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me; but one thing at least is clear , which is , that you decline allying yourself with my family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir , said danglars;  - i merely suspend my decision , that is all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices , and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , count , if you will not wait , we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count bit his lips till the blood almost started , to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain; understanding , however , that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him , he turned from the door , towards which he had been directing his steps , and again confronted the banker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a cloud settled on his brow , evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness , instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear danglars , said morcerf ,  - we have been acquainted for many years , and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each other s failings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is from no personal ill - feeling towards the viscount , that is all i can say , sir , replied danglars , who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and towards whom do you bear this personal ill - feeling , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morcerf , turning pale with anger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the expression of the count s face had not remained unperceived by the banker; he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count , and making a violent effort over himself , he said:  - i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it my fortune which you find insufficient? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing of the kind , sir , replied danglars:  - if such had been the case , i only should have been to blame , inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , do not seek any longer to discover the reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my daughter is only seventeen years old , and your son twenty - one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while we wait , time will be progressing , events will succeed each other; things which in the evening look dark and obscure , appear but too clearly in the light of morning , and sometimes the utterance of one word , or the lapse of a single day , will reveal the most cruel calumnies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - calumnies , did you say , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried morcerf , turning livid with rage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - does anyone dare to slander me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur , i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , sir , i am patiently to submit to your refusal? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive , for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance , and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and clutching his gloves in anger , he left the apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti , who had remained in the drawing - room with the ladies , was the last to leave the banker s house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he hastily tore off the cover , opened the journal with nervous precipitation , passed contemptuously over the paris jottings , and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence , stopped with a malicious smile , at a paragraph headed<s> <s> we hear from yanina . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very good , observed danglars , after having read the paragraph;  - here is a little article on colonel fernand , which , if i am not mistaken , would render the explanation which the comte de morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did he take baptistin with him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , my lord . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - call him , then; i wish to speak to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - out , even to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you think it will be long before he comes in? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i think not , for he ordered his breakfast at ten o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i will go and take a turn in the champs - lyses , and at ten o clock i will return here; meanwhile , if the count should come in , will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert left the cab in which he had come at the count s door , intending to take a turn on foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he was passing the alle des veuves , he thought he saw the count s horses standing at gosset s shooting - gallery; he approached , and soon recognized the coachman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is the count shooting in the gallery? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , replied the coachman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was speaking , albert had heard the report of two or three pistol - shots . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he entered , and on his way met the waiter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excuse me , my lord , said the lad;  - but will you have the kindness to wait a moment? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what for , philip? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked albert , who , being a constant visitor there , did not understand this opposition to his entrance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone , and never practices in the presence of anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then who loads his pistol? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is he , then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know this gentleman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , that is quite another thing , then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will go immediately and inform him of your arrival . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i went to your house , and they told me you were out , but that they expected you home at ten o clock to breakfast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o clock , when i caught sight of your carriage and horses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what on earth are you talking of? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am to fight today . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for the sake of fighting! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i understand that , but what is the quarrel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> people fight for all sorts of reasons , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , that is something serious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to be my second . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count turned up his sleeves , and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morcerf entered , and in place of the usual target , he saw some playing - cards fixed against the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit , for he counted from the ace to the ten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , ha , said albert ,  - i see you were preparing for a game of cards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said the count ,  - i was making a suit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert approached . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact , the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied , the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - diable! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what would you have , my dear viscount? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo , wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him;  - i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> both men entered monte cristo s carriage , which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 30 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo took albert into his study , and pointing to a seat , placed another for himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see i am perfectly composed , said albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with whom are you going to fight? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one of your friends! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course; it is always with friends that one fights . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i suppose you have some cause of quarrel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what has he done to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there appeared in his journal last nightbut wait , and read for yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and albert handed over the paper to the count , who read as follows: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a correspondent at yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french officer named fernand , in whom the grand vizier , ali tepelini , had reposed the greatest confidence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said monte cristo ,  - what do you see in that to annoy you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do i see in it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up by a french officer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it signifies to my father , the count of morcerf , whose christian name is fernand! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my dear viscount , do talk reason! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not desire to do otherwise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and who cares now about yanina , which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or 1823? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that just shows the meanness of this slander . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have allowed all this time to elapse , and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal , in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am going to beauchamp , in whose journal this paragraph appears , and i shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - beauchamp will never retract . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we will fight , nevertheless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will efface that blot on my father s character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses , do you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which means , i suppose , that you refuse the service which i asked of you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nevertheless , my dear count , i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because , my dear fellow , you understand one must never be eccentric . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if one s lot is cast among fools , it is necessary to study folly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp , who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp; he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other , he will bring his witnesses , or will insult me in some public place , and i am expected to kill him for all that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you admit that you would fight , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , if so , why do you object to my doing so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not say that you ought not to fight , i only say that a duel is a serious thing , and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - an announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - such is really the case , i assure you , upon my honor! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptiste , give me yesterday s paper , cried beauchamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here , i have brought mine with me , replied albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp took the paper , and read the article to which albert pointed in an undertone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is the officer referred to a relation of yours , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said albert , blushing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , what do you wish me to do for you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said he ,  - this matter will want a good deal of talking over; a retractation is always a serious thing , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sit down , and i will read it again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said albert in a determined tone ,  - you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family , and i insist on a retractation being made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you insist? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i insist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber , my dear viscount . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have known me long enough , continued albert , biting his lips convulsively , for he saw that beauchamp s anger was beginning to rise , - you have been my friend , and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i have been your friend , morcerf , your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but wait a moment , do not let us get angry , or at least not yet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are irritated and vexedtell me how this fernand is related to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is merely my father , said albert - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then i can well understand your indignation , my dear albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will look at it again; and he read the paragraph for the third time , laying a stress on each word as he proceeded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but the paper nowhere identifies this fernand with your father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; but the connection will be seen by others , and therefore i will have the article contradicted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will retract this assertion , will you not , beauchamp? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied beauchamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the thing is worth looking into , and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what is there to investigate , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert , enraged beyond measure at beauchamp s last remark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> am i to put this construction on your visit? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you insist on my contradicting the article relating to general fernand , an article with which , i assure you on my word of honor , i had nothing whatever to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i insist on it , said albert , whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and if i refuse to retract , you wish to fight , do you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said beauchamp in a calm tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the article was not inserted by mei was not even aware of it; but you have , by the step you have taken , called my attention to the paragraph in question , and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said albert , rising ,  - i will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you , and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons . </s> </s>

<s> <s> do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if i do not make it , although i have repeated more than once , and affirmed on my honor , that i was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me , and although i still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of morcerf under the name of fernand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i maintain my original resolution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well , my dear sir; then i consent to cut throats with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i require three weeks  preparation; at the end of that time i shall come and say to you , the assertion is false , and i retract it ,  or the assertion is true ,  when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath , or the pistols from the case , whichever you please . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when he had concluded his speech , beauchamp bowed coldly to albert , turned his back upon him , and went to the press - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture , as he was crossing the barrier he perceived morrel , who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was passing the chinese baths , and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saint - martin , and to be going towards the madeleine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said morcerf ,  - there goes a happy man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier had just sent for him , and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab , placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab - horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay , and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint - honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel advanced with a firm , manly tread , and poor barrois followed him as he best might . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel was only thirty - one , barrois was sixty years of age; morrel was deeply in love , and barrois was dying with heat and exertion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on arriving at the house , morrel was not even out of breath , for love lends wings to our desires; but barrois , who had long forgotten what it was to love , was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old servant introduced morrel by a private entrance , closed the door of the study , and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the easy - chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor , and he soon made his appearance in the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of valentine and himselfan intervention which had saved them from despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine was sitting at a little distance from them , timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier fixed his eyes on her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - am i to say what you told me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier made a sign that she was to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur morrel , said valentine to the young man , who was regarding her with the most intense interest ,  - my grandfather , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will repeat them , then; and since he has chosen me as his interpreter , i will be faithful to the trust , and will not alter a word of his intentions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i am listening with the greatest impatience , replied the young man;  - speak , i beg of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine cast down her eyes; this was a good omen for morrel , for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my grandfather intends leaving this house , said she ,  - and barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you , mademoiselle de villefort ,you , who are necessary to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s happiness<s> <s>  - i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> interrupted valentine;  - i shall not leave my grandfather ,that is an understood thing between us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my apartment will be close to his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal; in the first case , i shall leave directly , and in the second , i shall wait till i am of age , which will be in about ten months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and with my grandfather s consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone , that nothing but morrel s intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have i not explained your wishes , grandpapa? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said valentine , addressing noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , looked the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector , if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness; in that case i shall expect m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , alas , i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security; i trust we shall never find it so in our experience! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , cried morrel , almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine , and to adore them as two superior beings ,  - what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - until that time , continued the young girl in a calm and self - possessed tone of voice ,  - we will conform to circumstances , and be guided by the wishes of our friends , so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us; in a word , and i repeat it , because it expresses all i wish to convey ,we will wait . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes , sir , said morrel ,  - not only with resignation , but with cheerfulness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - therefore , continued valentine , looking playfully at maximilian ,  - no more inconsiderate actionsno more rash projects; for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined , honorably and happily , to bear your name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness , while barrois , who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed , smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how hot you look , my good barrois , said valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , i have been running very fast , mademoiselle , but i must do m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the fact is , mademoiselle , said barrois ,  - i am dying with thirst , and since you are so kind as to offer it me , i cannot say i should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take some , then , and come back immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine and morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier when a ring was heard at the door - bell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the signal of a visit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine looked at her watch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he will come in here , and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel had better go ,do you not think so , grandpapa? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , signed the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am coming , mademoiselle , replied he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - barrois will open the door for you , said valentine , addressing morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now remember one thing , monsieur officer , that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill - advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i promised him to wait , replied morrel;  - and i will wait . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who rang? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doctor d avrigny , said barrois , staggering as if he would fall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the matter , barrois? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man did not answer , but looked at his master with wild staring eyes , while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is going to fall! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rigors which had attacked barrois gradually increased , the features of the face became quite altered , and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , seeing barrois in this pitiable condition , showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> barrois made some steps towards his master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sufferingi cannot see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , don t touch me , pray don t . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets; his head fell back , and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine uttered a cry of horror; morrel took her in his arms , as if to defend her from some unknown danger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - help , help! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps , then fell at the feet of noirtier , and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid , exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel relaxed his hold of valentine , and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent , he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , burning with impatience and terror , was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic , whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> barrois , his features convulsed , his eyes suffused with blood , and his head thrown back , was lying at full length , beating the floor with his hands , while his legs had become so stiff , that they looked as if they would break rather than bend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment , and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not seen morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame , madame! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said madame de villefort in a harsh and constrained tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but where is the doctor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed villefort;  - where is he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in one hand she held her handkerchief , with which she appeared to be wiping her face , and in the other a bottle of english smelling - salts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her first look on entering the room was at noirtier , whose face , independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing , proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health; her second glance was at the dying man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she turned pale , and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the name of heaven , madame , said villefort ,  - where is the doctor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was with you just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see this is a fit of apoplexy , and he might be saved if he could but be bled! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - has he eaten anything lately? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked madame de villefort , eluding her husband s question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said madame de villefort ,  - why did he not take wine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lemonade was a very bad thing for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - grandpapa s bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side; poor barrois was very thirsty , and was thankful to drink anything he could find . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort started . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has such a short neck , said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame , said villefort ,  - i ask where is m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in god s name answer me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is with edward , who is not quite well , replied madame de villefort , no longer being able to avoid answering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take this , said madame de villefort , giving her smelling - bottle to valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they will , no doubt , bleed him; therefore i will retire , for i cannot endure the sight of blood; and she followed her husband upstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel now emerged from his hiding - place , where he had remained quite unperceived , so great had been the general confusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go away as quick as you can , maximilian , said valentine ,  - and stay till i send for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man , who had preserved all his usual coolness , made a sign to him to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man pressed valentine s hand to his lips , and then left the house by a back staircase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the crisis seemed past , a low moaning was heard , and he raised himself on one knee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you prescribe , doctor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give me some water and ether . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort immediately despatched a messenger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now let everyone retire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - must i go too? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked valentine timidly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , mademoiselle , you especially , replied the doctor abruptly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine looked at m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny with astonishment , kissed her grandfather on the forehead , and left the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look , look , doctor , said villefort ,  - he is quite coming round again; i really do not think , after all , it is anything of consequence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a little better , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you drink some of this ether and water? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will try; but don t touch me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> barrois took the glass , and , raising it to his purple lips , took about half of the liquid offered him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where do you suffer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - everywhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i feel cramps over my whole body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - frightful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when did you first feel that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - suddenly? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no drowsiness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what have you eaten today? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have eaten nothing; i only drank a glass of my master s lemonadethat s all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where is this lemonade? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the kitchen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will go myself and fetch the lemonade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she cried out , but d avrigny paid no attention to her; possessed with but one idea , he cleared the last four steps with a bound , and rushed into the kitchen , where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter , where it had been left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> panting with loss of breath , he returned to the room he had just left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is this the decanter you spoke of? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked d avrigny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is this the same lemonade of which you partook? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i believe so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what did it taste like? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand , put his lips to it , and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine , he spat the liquor into the fireplace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is no doubt the same , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , doctor , cried barrois ,  - the fit is coming on again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , do something for me . </s> </s>

<s> <s> villefort sprang into the passage , exclaiming ,  - the emetic! </s> </s>

<s> <s> but there is nothing which would do! nothing! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , sir , cried barrois ,  - are you going to let me die without help? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was one lying on the table; he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient , who , in the midst of his convulsions , was making vain attempts to vomit; but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor left him in this paroxysm , knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it , and , going up to noirtier , said abruptly: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you any weight on the chest; or does your stomach feel light and comfortableeh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which i am accustomed to give you every sunday? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did barrois make your lemonade? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you bring it to your master directly it was made? </s> </s>

<s> <s> the terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said d avrigny to villefort , so loud that all might hear ,  - poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late; accustomed formerly to ride on horseback , or in the carriage , to the four corners of europe , the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed himhis blood has thickened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor , without shaking hands with villefort , without adding a word to what he had said , went out , amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same evening all villefort s servants , who had assembled in the kitchen , and had a long consultation , came to tell madame de villefort that they wished to leave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no entreaty , no proposition of increased wages , could induce them to remain; to every argument they replied ,  - we must go , for death is in this house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they all left , in spite of prayers and entreaties , testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress , and especially mademoiselle valentine , so good , so kind , and so gentle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort looked at valentine as they said this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was in tears , and , strange as it was , in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears , he looked also at madame de villefort , and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips , like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he would not , however , yield immediately to the young man s request , but made a few conscientious objections . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you not rather young , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think not , sir , replied m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti;  - in italy the nobility generally marry young . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , sir , said danglars ,  - in case your proposals , which do me honor , are accepted by my wife and daughter , by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , my father is a man of great foresight and prudence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so far as i can judge , i suppose this to be a quarter of my father s revenue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i , said danglars ,  - have always intended giving my daughter 500 ,000 francs as her dowry; she is , besides , my sole heiress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we should command an annuity of 175 ,000 livres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> supposing , also , i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital , which is not likely , but still is possible , we would place these two or three millions in your hands , whose talent might make it realize ten per cent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never give more than four per cent , and generally only three and a half; but to my son - in - law i would give five , and we would share the profits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said danglars , who , on his part , did not perceive how soon the conversation , which was at first disinterested , was turning to a business transaction ,  - there is , doubtless , a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that you inherit from your mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - truly , from my mother , leonora corsinari . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how much may it amount to? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , sir , said andrea ,  - i assure you i have never given the subject a thought , but i suppose it must have been at least two millions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure , or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may not only hope , said danglars ,  - but consider it a settled thing , if no obstacle arises on your part . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am , indeed , rejoiced , said andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo , did not make his proposal for you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have just left the count , sir , said he;  - he is , doubtless , a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me; but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another , and he never would . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must , however , do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion , because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what may you have to say to him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that the day after tomorrow i shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs; but the count , expecting my bachelor s revenue could not suffice for the coming month s outlay , has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it bears his signature , as you see , which is all - sufficient . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bring me a million such as that , said danglars ,  - i shall be well pleased , putting the draft in his pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at ten o clock then , if you please; i should like it early , as i am going into the country tomorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well , at ten o clock; you are still at the htel des princes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the following morning , with the banker s usual punctuality , the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young man s hands , as he was on the point of starting , after having left two hundred francs for caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said andrea ,  - my father s old servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , you gave him the two hundred francs i had left for him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , your excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , continued the porter ,  - he would not take them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would not take them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , he wished to speak to your excellency; i told him you were gone out , and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter , which he had brought with him already sealed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give it me , said andrea , and he read by the light of his carriage - lamp: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know where i live; i expect you tomorrow morning at nine o clock . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> andrea examined it carefully , to ascertain if the letter had been opened , or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents; but it was so carefully folded , that no one could have read it , and the seal was perfect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor man , he is a worthy creature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he left the porter to ponder on these words , not knowing which most to admire , the master or the servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousse s letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servant entered just as he had finished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening , and do not wish to be known; lend me your livery till tomorrow . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the next morning he left that inn as he had left the htel des princes , without being noticed , walked down the faubourg saint - antoine , along the boulevard to rue mnilmontant , and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter s absence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for whom are you looking , my fine fellow? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the fruiteress on the opposite side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monsieur pailletin , if you please , my good woman , replied andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a retired baker? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the fruiteress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he lives at the end of the yard , on the left , on the third story . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - confound you and your punctuality! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see , i have thought about youlook at the good breakfast we are going to have; nothing but what you are fond of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea , indeed , inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him , hungry as he was; it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provenal kitchens of an inferior order , added to that of dried fish , and above all , the pungent smell of musk and cloves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove , and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in an adjoining room andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two , two bottles of wine sealed , the one with green , the other with yellow , a supply of brandy in a decanter , and a measure of fruit in a cabbage - leaf , cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you think of it , my little fellow? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes , and i think you relished them tolerably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said andrea , ill - temperedly ,  - by my faith , if it was only to breakfast with you , that you disturbed me , i wish the devil had taken you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my boy , said caderousse sententiously ,  - one can talk while eating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , you ungrateful being , you are not pleased to see an old friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am weeping with joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hold your tongue , hypocrite , said andrea;  - you love me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know it is a weakness , said caderousse ,  - but it overpowers me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said caderousse , wiping his large knife on his apron ,  - if i did not like you , do you think i should endure the wretched life you lead me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> think for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d hte of the htel des princes , or the caf de paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , i too could keep a servant; i too could have a tilbury; i too could dine where i like; but why do i not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> because i would not annoy my little benedetto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , just acknowledge that i could , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said andrea ,  - admitting your love , why do you want me to breakfast with you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that i may have the pleasure of seeing you , my little fellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - eh , dear friend , said caderousse ,  - are wills ever made without codicils? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , sit down , and let us begin with these pilchards , and this fresh butter; which i have put on some vine - leaves to please you , wicked one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what do you expect? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is not the htel des princes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , you are growing discontented , you are no longer happy; you , who only wish to live like a retired baker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse sighed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have seen your dream realized . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , since i bring you your two hundred francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse shrugged his shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is humiliating , said he ,  - thus to receive money given grudgingly ,an uncertain supply which may soon fail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see i am obliged to economize , in case your prosperity should cease . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , my friend , fortune is inconstant , as the chaplain of the regiment said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know your prosperity is great , you rascal; you are to marry the daughter of danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i might as well say count benedetto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding , seeing he came to mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , yes , to mine; gad , he was not so proud then ,he was an under - clerk to the good m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf , so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little , we might meet in the same drawing - rooms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is all very fine , benedetto mio , but i know what i am saying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite , praising each dish he set before his visitor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter seemed to have resigned himself; he drew the corks , and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - faith , yes , replied andrea , whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so you like it , you rogue? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , truly; you may believe me if you will; at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good caderousse! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so much so , that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , you wished to speak to me; but was it indeed remorse , tell me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true remorse; and , besides , an idea had struck me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea shuddered; he always did so at caderousse s ideas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is miserabledo you see? always to wait till the end of the month . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said andrea philosophically , determined to watch his companion narrowly ,  - does not life pass in waiting? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , i wait patiently , do i not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs , you expect five or six thousand , perhaps ten , perhaps even twelve , for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> down there , you always had little presents and christmas - boxes , which you tried to hide from your poor friend caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fortunately he is a cunning fellow , that friend caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there you are beginning again to ramble , to talk again and again of the past! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , you are only one - and - twenty , and can forget the past; i am fifty , and am obliged to recollect it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but let us return to business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was going to say , if i were in your place<s> <s>  - well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would ask for six months  in advance , under pretence of being able to purchase a farm , then with my six months i would decamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said andrea ,  - why do you not act on the advice you gave me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why do you not realize a six months  , a year s advance even , and retire to brussels? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of living the retired baker , you might live as a bankrupt , using his privileges; that would be very good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two months ago you were dying with hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the appetite grows by what it feeds on , said caderousse , grinning and showing his teeth , like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse s plans alarmed andrea still more than his ideas; ideas were but the germ , the plan was reality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me see your plan; i dare say it is a pretty one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of m! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , pursued caderousse ,  - can you without expending one sou , put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , fifteen thousand are not enough ,i cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied andrea , dryly ,  - no , i cannot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you want me to commit a robbery , to spoil all my good fortuneand yours with mineand both of us to be dragged down there again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it would make very little difference to me , said caderousse ,  - if i were retaken , i am a poor creature to live alone , and sometimes pine for my old comrades; not like you , heartless creature , who would be glad never to see them again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea did more than tremble this time , he turned pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , caderousse , no nonsense! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t alarm yourself , my little benedetto , but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance , and i will contrive it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs , my little fellow? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have a fancy , and mean to get a housekeeper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , you shall have your five hundred francs , said andrea;  - but it is very hard for me , my poor caderousseyou take advantage<s> <s>  - bah , said caderousse ,  - when you have access to countless stores . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one would have said andrea anticipated his companion s words , so did his eye flash like lightning , but it was but for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , he replied ,  - and my protector is very kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - five thousand francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as many thousands as you give me hundreds! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> truly , it is only bastards who are thus fortunate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> five thousand francs per month! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what the devil can you do with all that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , it is no trouble to spend that; and i am like you , i want capital . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , and i shall get it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but unfortunately i must wait . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must wait for what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for his death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the death of your prince? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because he has made his will in my favor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on my honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for five hundred thousand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - only that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it s little enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but so it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , it cannot be! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you my friend , caderousse? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but remember<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pardieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mute as a carp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i think<s> <s> andrea stopped and looked around . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not fear; pardieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think i have discovered my father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not old cavalcanti? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , for he has gone again; the true one , as you say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that father is<s> <s>  - well , caderousse , it is monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , you understand , that explains all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cannot acknowledge me openly , it appears , but he does it through m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti , and gives him fifty thousand francs for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would have done it for half that , for twenty thousand , for fifteen thousand; why did you not think of me , ungrateful man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did i know anything about it , when it was all done when i was down there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and you say that by his will<s> <s>  - he leaves me five hundred thousand livres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he showed it me; but that is not allthere is a codicil , as i said just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and in that codicil he acknowledges me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , the good father , the brave father , the very honest father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse , twirling a plate in the air between his two hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , say if i conceal anything from you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion; and your princely father , is he rich , very rich? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it possible? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is evident enough to me , who am always at his house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse was filled with wonder; the young man s words sounded to him like metal , and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you go into that house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse was thoughtful for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then suddenly ,<s> <s>  - how i should like to see all that , cried he;  - how beautiful it must be! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is , in fact , magnificent , said andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said caderousse ,  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - possibly; but it is not the exterior i care for , it is the interior . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what beautiful furniture there must be in it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you ever seen the tuileries? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo lets fall his purse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not worthwhile to wait for that , said andrea;  - money is as plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you should take me there one day with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how can i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on what plea? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are right; but you have made my mouth water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must absolutely see it; i shall find a way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no nonsense , caderousse! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will offer myself as floor - polisher . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , i must be contented to imagine it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is the best plan , believe me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - try , at least , to give me an idea of what it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how can i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing is easier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it large? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - middling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - faith , i should require pen , ink , and paper to make a plan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they are all here , said caderousse , briskly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the house , as i said , is between the court and the garden; in this way , do you see? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea drew the garden , the court and the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - high walls? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not more than eight or ten feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is not prudent , said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the court are orange - trees in pots , turf , and clumps of flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and no steel - traps? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the stables? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us see the ground floor , said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - windows? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - magnificent windows , so beautiful , so large , that i believe a man of your size should pass through each frame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why the devil have they any stairs with such windows? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - luxury has everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , but they are never used . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that count of monte cristo is an original , who loves to look at the sky even at night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and where do the servants sleep? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , they have a house to themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> picture to yourself a pretty coach - house at the right - hand side where the ladders are kept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bells did you say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night , but it has been taken to the house at auteuil , to that you went to , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was saying to him only yesterday , you are imprudent , monsieur count; for when you go to auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  well ,  said he , what next?   well , next , some day you will be robbed . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - what did he answer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he quietly said , what do i care if i am?  <s> <s>  - andrea , he has some secretaire with a spring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how do you know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has simply a mahogany secretaire , in which the key is always kept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and he is not robbed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there ought to be some money in that secretaire? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there may be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sketch me the plan of that floor , as you have done of the ground floor , my boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is very simple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the famous secretaire is in the dressing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is there a window in the dressing - room? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - two ,one here and one there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea sketched two windows in the room , which formed an angle on the plan , and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse became thoughtful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - does he often go to auteuil? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> added he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - two or three times a week . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tomorrow , for instance , he is going to spend the day and night there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you sure of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there s a life for you , said caderousse;  - a town house and a country house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and shall you dine there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when you dine there , do you sleep there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i like; i am at home there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse looked at the young man , as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but andrea drew a cigar - case from his pocket , took a havana , quietly lit it , and began smoking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when do you want your twelve hundred francs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , if you have them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea took five - and - twenty louis from his pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yellow boys? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you despise them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on the contrary , i esteem them , but will not have them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you can change them , idiot; gold is worth five sous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no nonsense , my good fellow; silver simply , round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anybody may possess a five - franc piece . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should want a porter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , leave them with your porter; he is to be trusted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will call for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , tomorrow i will leave them when i go to auteuil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may i depend on it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because i shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now see here , will that be all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and will you not torment me any more? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he redoubled his gayety and carelessness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how sprightly you are , said caderousse;  - one would say you were already in possession of your property . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , unfortunately; but when i do obtain it<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall remember old friends , i can tell you that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you want? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it looks as if you were trying to fleece me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what an idea! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i , who am going to give you another piece of good advice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we shall both get into trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will ruin both yourself and me by your folly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you guess well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you do well to boast of it , said andrea , who , without becoming angry , as caderousse feared , at this new extortion , quietly resigned the ring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse looked so closely at it that andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are joking now , replied andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not be angry , we can try it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse went to the window , touched the glass with it , and found it would cut . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - confiteor! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse , putting the diamond on his little finger;  - i was mistaken; but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller s shopit is another branch of industry paralyzed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you finished? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make free , now you have begun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; you are , after all , a good companion; i will not detain you , and will try to cure myself of my ambition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall not sell itdo not fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not at least till the day after tomorrow , thought the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - happy rogue , said caderousse;  - you are going to find your servants , your horses , your carriage , and your betrothed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i hope you will make a handsome wedding - present the day you marry mademoiselle danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what fortune has she? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i tell you<s> <s>  - a million? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea shrugged his shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let it be a million , said caderousse;  - you can never have so much as i wish you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i wish it you with all my heart! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> added caderousse with his hoarse laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not worthwhile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , said andrea;  - i will let you know a week beforehand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they parted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen andrea go down the three stories , but also cross the court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he returned hastily , shut his door carefully , and began to study , like a clever architect , the plan andrea had left him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day following that on which the conversation we have related took place , the count of monte cristo set out for auteuil , accompanied by ali and several attendants , and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was induced to undertake this journey , of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to andrea either , by the arrival of bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the house was ready , and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men , who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said he ,  - i may require to go in one night from paris to trport; let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road , which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your highness had already expressed that wish , said bertuccio ,  - and the horses are ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have bought them , and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts , that is , in villages , where no one generally stops . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders , baptistin opened the door: he held a letter on a silver waiter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistin , without answering , approached the count , and presented the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - important and urgent , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the champs - lyses with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count s well - known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police , whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count , by any opening from the bedroom , or by concealing himself in the dressing - room , would be able to defend his property himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt , and m . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> the count s first idea was that this was an artificea gross deception , to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police , notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend , or perhaps because of that advice , when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy , whom he alone should recognize and over whom , if such were the case , he alone would gain any advantage , as fiesco[17] had done over the moor who would have killed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we know the count s vigorous and daring mind , denying anything to be impossible , with that energy which marks the great man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from his past life , from his resolution to shrink from nothing , the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged , sometimes against nature , that is to say , against god , and sometimes against the world , that is , against the devil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am rich enough , forsooth , to distribute his authority on this occasion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count recalled baptistin , who had left the room after delivering the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - return to paris , said he;  - assemble the servants who remain there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but will no one remain in the house , my lord? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked baptistin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , the porter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by whom? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by thieves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thieves might strip the houseit would annoy me less than to be disobeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistin bowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bring your comrades here , one and all; but let everything remain as usual , only close the shutters of the ground floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and those of the first floor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count signified his intention of dining alone , and that no one but ali should attend him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation , the count , making a signal to ali to follow him , went out by the side - gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned , apparently without design towards paris and at twilight; found himself opposite his house in the champs - lyses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all was dark; one solitary , feeble light was burning in the porter s lodge , about forty paces distant from the house , as baptistin had said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he hastened to the side - door with ali , entered hurriedly , and by the servants  staircase , of which he had the key , gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain , without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house , which he supposed empty , contained its chief occupant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything appeared as usualthe precious secretaire in its place , and the key in the secretaire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count requirednamely , a short carbine and a pair of double - barrelled pistols , with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single - barrelled one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was about half - past nine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had within his reach his pistols and carbine , and ali , standing near him , held one of the small arabian hatchets , whose form has not varied since the crusades . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> through one of the windows of the bedroom , on a line with that in the dressing - room , the count could see into the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two hours passed thus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it might be expected that the attack , if indeed an attack was projected , would be made from the staircase of the ground floor , and not from a window; in monte cristo s opinion , the villains sought his life , not his money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would be his bedroom they would attack , and they must reach it by the back staircase , or by the window in the dressing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the last stroke died away , the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing - room; this first sound , or rather this first grinding , was followed by a second , then a third; at the fourth , the count knew what to expect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a firm and well - practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count felt his heart beat more rapidly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inured as men may be to danger , forewarned as they may be of peril , they understand , by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame , the enormous difference between a dream and a reality , between the project and the execution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fixed his eyes on that windowhe distinguished a shadow in the darkness; then one of the panes became quite opaque , as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside , then the square cracked without falling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening , then a second; the window turned on its hinges , and a man entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s a daring rascal , whispered the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he ,  - there are two of them; one does the work while the other stands guard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street , and turned to the one in the dressing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the glass - cutter had entered , and was feeling his way , his arms stretched out before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were two doors; he bolted them both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was only a precaution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the glass - cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys , such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock , and which thieves call nightingales , doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the man in the dark could not find the right key . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand , touched a spring , and immediately a pale light , just bright enough to render objects distinct , was reflected on his hands and countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by heavens , exclaimed monte cristo , starting back ,  - it is<s> <s> ali raised his hatchet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he added some words in a low tone , for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count , faint as it had been , had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife - grinder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat , waistcoat , and shirt , and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail , of which the last in france , where daggers are no longer dreaded , was worn by king louis xvi . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , who feared the dagger at his breast , and whose head was cleft with a hatchet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock , as did his hair under a priest s wig; the three - cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man , hearing nothing more , stood erect , and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire , whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he advanced to the window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down , and was still pacing the street; but , strange as it appeared , he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champs - lyses or by the faubourg saint - honor; his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the count s , and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips; then drawing near to ali , he whispered: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - remain here , concealed in the dark , and whatever noise you hear , whatever passes , only come in or show yourself if i call you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali bowed in token of strict obedience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , good - evening , my dear m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the abb busoni! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed caderousse; and , not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors , he let fall his bunch of keys , and remained motionless and stupefied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count placed himself between caderousse and the window , thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the abb busoni! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , undoubtedly , the abb busoni himself , replied monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i am very glad you recognize me , dear m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse; it proves you have a good memory , for it must be about ten years since we last met . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the abb , the abb! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured he , clenching his fists , and his teeth chattering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so you would rob the count of monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , come , continued the count ,  - i see you are still the same ,an assassin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - reverend sir , since you know everything , you know it was not iit was la carconte; that was proved at the trial , since i was only condemned to the galleys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , reverend sir; i have been liberated by someone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that someone has done society a great kindness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said caderousse ,  - i had promised<s> <s>  - and you are breaking your promise! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> interrupted monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , yes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse very uneasily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a bad relapse , that will lead you , if i mistake not , to the place de grve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so much the worse , so much the worsediavolo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - reverend sir , i am impelled<s> <s>  - every criminal says the same thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poverty<s> <s>  - pshaw! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said busoni disdainfully;  - poverty may make a man beg , steal a loaf of bread at a baker s door , but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - idiot! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what would be the advantage of waking the porter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , reverend sir , tell me , do you wish me dead? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wish what god wills . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - then i shall believe god has forgiven you , and i will forgive you too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as true as i am a christian , stammered caderousse ,  - you will make me die of fright! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse , scarcely yet relying on this promise , put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder . </s> </s>

<s> <s> help , reverend sir ,help! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this mournful appeal pierced the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door of the back - staircase opened , then the side - gate of the garden , and ali and his master were on the spot with lights . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - what is the matter? </s> </s>

<s> <s> when the wretched man again opened his eyes , the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity , and his lips moved as if in prayer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know he cannot save my life , but he may strengthen me to give my evidence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - against whom? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - against my murderer . </s> </s>

<s> <s> after giving me the plan of this house , doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir , or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way , he waylaid me , and has murdered me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he will not come in time; i feel my life fast ebbing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait a moment , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he left the room , and returned in five minutes with a phial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dying man s eyes were all the time riveted on the door , through which he hoped succor would arrive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall faint again! </s> </s>

<s> <s> you can sign it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , said caderousse; and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo wrote: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 59 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse ,  - or i shall be unable to sign it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse , who collected all his strength , signed it , and fell back on his bed , saying: </s> </s>

<s> <s> he lodges at the htel des princes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , i am dying! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , and much more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what more will you say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house , in the hope the count would kill you . </s> </s>

<s> <s> said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will say , continued the count ,  - that he followed and watched you the whole time , and when he saw you leave the house , ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - and you did not warn me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; for i saw god s justice placed in the hands of benedetto , and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - god s justice! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> speak not of it , reverend sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - patience , said the abb , in a tone which made the dying man shudder;  - have patience! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse looked at him with amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - besides , said the abb ,  - god is merciful to all , as he has been to you; he is first a father , then a judge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you then believe in god? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - had i been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now , said monte cristo ,  - i must believe on seeing you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , said the abb , extending his hand over the wounded man , as if to command him to believe;  - this is what the god in whom , on your death - bed , you refuse to believe , has done for youhe gave you health , strength , regular employment , even friendsa life , in fact , which a man might enjoy with a calm conscience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> instead of improving these gifts , rarely granted so abundantly , this has been your courseyou have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness , and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried caderousse;  - i require a surgeon , not a priest; perhaps i am not mortally woundedi may not die; perhaps they can yet save my life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your wounds are so far mortal that , without the three drops i gave you , you would now be dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> listen , then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , murmured caderousse ,  - what a strange priest you are; you drive the dying to despair , instead of consoling them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , continued the abb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when you had betrayed your friend , god began not to strike , but to warn you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poverty overtook you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this unexpected , unhoped - for , unheard - of fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it; you wished to double it , and how? by a murder! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to transport me for life , how merciful! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you thought it a mercy then , miserable wretch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace; for like all galley - slaves , you said , i may escape from prison , i cannot from the grave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and you said truly; the way was opened for you unexpectedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have not enough ,  you said , when you had more than you before possessed , and you committed a third crime , without reason , without excuse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse was fast sinking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo gave him a glass of water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and yet that villain , benedetto , will escape! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no one , i tell you , will escape; benedetto will be punished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count , with a smile which petrified the dying man ,  - when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent , i might have prevented benedetto from killing you; but i found you proud and blood - thirsty , and i left you in the hands of god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not believe there is a god , howled caderousse;  - you do not believe it; you lieyou lie! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you do not believe in god when he is striking you dead? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god , who might have directed the assassin s dagger so as to end your career in a moment , has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> reflect , then , wretched man , and repent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said caderousse ,  - no; i will not repent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no god; there is no providenceall comes by chance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is a providence; there is a god , said monte cristo ,  - of whom you are a striking proof , as you lie in utter despair , denying him , while i stand before you , rich , happy , safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe , while in your heart you still believe in him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but who are you , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo , putting the light near his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo took off the wig which disfigured him , and let fall his black hair , which added so much to the beauty of his pallid features . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse , thunderstruck ,  - but for that black hair , i should say you were the englishman , lord wilmore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am neither the abb busoni nor lord wilmore , said monte cristo;  - think again ,do you not recollect me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a magic effect in the count s words , which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who , then , are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and why , if you knew me , do you let me die? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because nothing can save you; your wounds are mortal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by your father s tomb! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said caderousse , supported by a supernatural power , and half - raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred;  - who , then , are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he knew this was the last struggle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse , who had raised himself on his knees , and stretched out his arm , tried to draw back , then clasping his hands , and raising them with a desperate effort ,  - oh , my god , my god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he ,  - pardon me for having denied thee; thou dost exist , thou art indeed man s father in heaven , and his judge on earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> caderousse sighed deeply , and fell back with a groan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the blood no longer flowed from his wounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count mysteriously , his eyes fixed on the corpse , disfigured by so awful a death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived , the one accompanied by the porter , the other by ali , and were received by the abb busoni , who was praying by the side of the corpse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place , as the young man was received at the banker s as the betrothed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> letters had been despatched to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti , as the count s father , who highly approved of the union , regretted his inability to leave parma at that time , and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the baron adored count andrea cavalcanti; not so mademoiselle eugnie danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly expired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one had taken up the remark about the general , and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of yanina the noble count in the house of peers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert , however , felt no less insulted; the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited albert , and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one morning albert was awakened by his valet de chambre , who announced beauchamp . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - tell me , may i shake hands with you , saying , beauchamp , acknowledge you have injured me , and retain my friendship ,  or must i simply propose to you a choice of arms? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - albert , said the journalist ,  - these are questions which it is difficult to answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will facilitate it by repeating the question , will you , or will you not , retract?  <s> <s>  - morcerf , it is not enough to answer yes  or no  to questions which concern the honor , the social interest , and the life of such a man as lieutenant - gnral the count of morcerf , peer of france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what i have done , albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i reasoned thusmoney , time , and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family; probabilities will not suffice , only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i strike with the sword , or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom , for three years , i have been on terms of intimacy , i must , at least , know why i do so; i must meet him with a heart at ease , and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said morcerf , impatiently ,  - what does all this mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it means that i have just returned from yanina . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from yanina? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - impossible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert cast his eyes on the passport , then raised them in astonishment to beauchamp . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - albert , had you been a stranger , a foreigner , a simple lord , like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since , and whom i killed to get rid of , i should not have taken this trouble; but i thought this mark of consideration due to you . </s> </s>

<s> <s> oh , no self - love , beauchamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> acknowledge it , beauchamp; your courage cannot be doubted . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the paragraph was correct , my friend . </s> </s>

<s> <s> albert advanced furiously towards beauchamp , but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friend , said he ,  - here is a proof of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert opened the paper , it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of yanina , proving that colonel fernand mondego , in the service of ali tepelini , had surrendered the castle for two million crowns . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it could no longer be doubted; the family name was fully given . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but , on the contrary , the particulars which are given prove that fernand mondego , raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor - general , is no other than count fernand of morcerf; then , recollecting the honor you had done me , in admitting me to your friendship , i hastened to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hastened to you , continued beauchamp ,  - to tell you , albert , that in this changing age , the faults of a father cannot revert upon his children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> few have passed through this revolutionary period , in the midst of which we were born , without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier , or the gown of the magistrate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now i have these proofs , albert , and i am in your confidence , no human power can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal , but i come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you wish these proofs , these attestations , which i alone possess , to be destroyed? </s> </s>

<s> <s> albert seized them with a convulsive hand , tore them in pieces , and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him , he approached the wax - light , always kept burning for cigars , and burned every fragment . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , yes , said albert ,  - and may there remain only the eternal friendship which i promised to my deliverer , which shall be transmitted to our children s children , and shall always remind me that i owe my life and the honor of my name to you ,for had this been known , oh , beauchamp , i should have destroyed myself; or ,no , my poor mother! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - well , said beauchamp ,  - what still oppresses you , my friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am broken - hearted , said albert . </s> </s>

<s> <s> said albert , gazing through his tears at his mother s portrait;  - if you know this , how much must you suffer! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said beauchamp , taking both his hands ,  - take courage , my friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but how came that first note to be inserted in your journal? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance , bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and deatha fatal secret , known only when the storm bursts . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i think nothing , my friend; but all things are possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the way<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert , seeing that beauchamp hesitated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you going to marry mademoiselle danglars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why do you ask me now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert ,  - the engagement is broken off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said beauchamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy ,  - let us go out , albert , said he;  - a ride in the wood in the phaeton , or on horseback , will refresh you; we will then return to breakfast , and you shall attend to your affairs , and i to mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i think a little exertion would do me good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two friends walked out on the fortress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - since we are out , said beauchamp ,  - let us call on m . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - certainly! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you come from the end of the world? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is the talk of all paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you , count , have made this match? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i? </s> </s>

<s> <s> said the young man;  - oh , no , indeed , the count will do me the justice to assert that i have , on the contrary , always entreated him to break off my engagement , and happily it is ended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count pretends i have not him to thank;so be iti will erect an altar deo ignoto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , said monte cristo;  - i have had little to do with it , for i am at variance both with the father - in - law and the young man; there is only mademoiselle eugnie , who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony , and who , seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty , retains any affection for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , in spite of all i could say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not know the young man; he is said to be of good family and rich , but i never trust to vague assertions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars of it till i am tired , but he is fascinated with his luccanese . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have even informed him of a circumstance i consider very serious; the young man was either charmed by his nurse , stolen by gypsies , or lost by his tutor , i scarcely know which . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years; what he did during these ten years , god only knows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , all that was useless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers , and here they are . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - and what does mademoiselle d armilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari; i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre , who is under some obligation to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you look dull; are you , after all , unconsciously in love with mademoiselle eugnie? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not aware of it , said albert , smiling sorrowfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , continued monte cristo ,  - you are not in your usual spirits? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have a dreadful headache , said albert . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you annoyed , count? </s> </s>

<s> <s> i was rocked when an infant in the arms of old ocean , and on the bosom of the beautiful amphitrite; i have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of the other; i love the sea as a mistress , and pine if i do not often see her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us go , count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to sea? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you accept my proposal? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , viscount , there will be in my courtyard this evening a good travelling britzka , with four post - horses , in which one may rest as in a bed . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - thank you , i have just returned from sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have been to sea? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what of that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , dear morcerf; you know i only refuse when the thing is impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , it is important , added he in a low tone ,  - that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert and beauchamp parted , the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - beauchamp is a worthy fellow , said monte cristo , when the journalist was gone;  - is he not , albert? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now we are alone ,although it is immaterial to me ,where are we going? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - into normandy , if you like . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - delightful; shall we be quite retired? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have no society , no neighbors? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - our companions will be riding - horses , dogs to hunt with , and a fishing - boat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exactly what i wish for; i will apprise my mother of my intention , and return to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but shall you be allowed to go into normandy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i am aware you may go alone , since i once met you in italybut to accompany the mysterious monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>; woman is like a wave of the sea ,  said shakespeare; both the great king and the great poet ought to have known woman s nature well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - woman s , yes; my mother is not woman , but a woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes , indeed , said monte cristo with a sigh;  - and do you think she is in the least interested in me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and does she try to make you dislike me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on the contrary , she often says , morcerf , i believe the count has a noble nature; try to gain his esteem . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see , then , said albert ,  - that instead of opposing , she will encourage me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - adieu , then , until five o clock; be punctual , and we shall arrive at twelve or one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; or in the neighborhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but can we travel forty - eight leagues in eight hours? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - easily , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are certainly a prodigy; you will soon not only surpass the railway , which would not be very difficult in france , but even the telegraph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , viscount , since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours , do not keep me waiting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not fear , i have little to prepare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert , then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie , he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bertuccio , said he ,  - i intend going this evening to normandy , instead of tomorrow or the next day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will have sufficient time before five o clock; despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf will accompany me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage , and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before his departure , the count went to hayde s apartments , told her his intention , and resigned everything to her care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count put his head out of the window and whistled , and the horses appeared to fly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement , and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali , smiling , repeated the sound , grasped the reins with a firm hand , and spurred his horses , whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this child of the desert was in his element , and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared , in the cloud of dust he raised , like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are they made to order? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - precisely , said the count;  - six years since i bought a horse in hungary remarkable for its swiftness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the thirty - two that we shall use tonight are its progeny; they are all entirely black , with the exception of a star upon the forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see , i travel with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you are not always travelling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when i no longer require them , bertuccio will sell them , and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then he will sell them to some eastern vizier , who will empty his coffers to purchase them , and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear count , if you tell me many more marvellous things , i warn you i shall not believe them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i countenance nothing that is marvellous , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , why does a steward rob his master? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because , i suppose , it is his nature to do so , for the love of robbing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation , and wishes to provide for the future . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio is alone in the world; he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it; he is sure never to leave my service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because i should never get a better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - probabilities are deceptive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i deal in certainties; he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you possess that right over bertuccio? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are words which close a conversation with an iron door; such was the count s  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity; the thirty - two horses , dispersed over seven stages , brought them to their destination in eight hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the porter was in attendance; he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the count s approach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments , where a bath and supper were prepared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert bathed , took his supper , and went to bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a creek lay a little sloop , with a narrow keel and high masts , bearing on its flag the monte cristo arms which were a mountain or , on a sea azure , with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary , the mount rendered by our lord s passion more precious than gold , and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy; or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personage s past life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> around the schooner lay a number of small fishing - boats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village , like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there , as in every spot where monte cristo stopped , if but for two days , luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert found in his anteroom two guns , with all the accoutrements for hunting; a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the englisheminent in piscatory pursuits , since they are patient and sluggishhave invented for fishing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day passed in pursuing those exercises in which monte cristo excelled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> towards the evening of the third day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert , completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated monte cristo , was sleeping in an armchair near the window , while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house , when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made albert look up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre , whom he had not brought , that he might not inconvenience monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - florentin here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he hastened to the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo watched and saw him approach the valet , who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket , containing a newspaper and a letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from whom is this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he eagerly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp , replied florentin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did he send you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir; he sent for me to his house , gave me money for my journey , procured a horse , and made me promise not to stop till i had reached you , i have come in fifteen hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his sight was dimmed , his legs sank under him , and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor young man , said monte cristo in a low voice;  - it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile albert had revived , and , continuing to read , he threw back his head , saying: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a poor , lame post - horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all was quiet , but on returning from m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp; she first extended her arms to prevent me , but after a moment s reflection , yes , go , florentin ,  said she , and may he come quickly . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - yes , my mother , said albert ,  - i will return , and woe to the infamous wretch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but first of all i must get there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his voice had become rough and hoarse; his face was furrowed with wrinkles; his eyes burned under the blue - veined lids , and he tottered like a drunken man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , said he ,  - i thank you for your hospitality , which i would gladly have enjoyed longer; but i must return to paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what has happened? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a great misfortune , more important to me than life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t question me , i beg of you , but lend me a horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my stables are at your command , viscount; but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , it would delay me , and i need the fatigue you warn me of; it will do me good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion; he was at the window , calling: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerfquick! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is in a hurry! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried he , throwing himself on his horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - return as soon as you can , florentin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - only dismount; another will be immediately saddled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert hesitated a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> read that , said he ,  - when i am gone , that you may not be witness of my anger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse , which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus , and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count watched him with a feeling of compassion , and when he had completely disappeared , read as follows: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in l impartial , who not only surrendered the castle of yanina , but sold his benefactor to the turks , styled himself truly at that time fernand , as our esteemed contemporary states; but he has since added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he now calls himself the count of morcerf , and ranks among the peers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp was in his bath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here i am , albert said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , my poor friend , replied beauchamp ,  - i expected you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your having sent for me is another proof of your affection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , without losing time , tell me , have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think i have some clew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sent immediately for a cabriolet , and hastened to the publisher s office . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper , beauchampas it sometimes , we may say often , happenswas his intimate friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the editor was reading , with apparent delight , a leading article in the same paper on beet - sugar , probably a composition of his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , pardieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said beauchamp ,  - with the paper in your hand , my friend , i need not tell you the cause of my visit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you interested in the sugar question? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the editor of the ministerial paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied beauchamp ,  - i have not considered the question; a totally different subject interests me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it not a curious affair? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so curious , that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf will not raise his voice against us; besides , it is rendering a service to one s country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp was thunderstruck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who , then , has so correctly informed you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he;  - for my paper , which gave the first information on the subject , has been obliged to stop for want of proof; and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf , as he is a peer of france , and we are of the opposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , that is very simple; we have not sought to scandalize . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this news was brought to us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man arrived yesterday from yanina , bringing a formidable array of documents; and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article , he told us it should be inserted in some other paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit , and left the office to despatch a courier to morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars , as the events had transpired after the messenger s departure; namely , that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour , and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some were perusing the article , others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like all upstarts , he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the true nobility laughed at him , the talented repelled him , and the honorable instinctively despised him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was , in fact , in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice; the finger of god once pointed at him , everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article , and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he arrived at his usual hour , with a proud look and insolent demeanor; he alighted , passed through the corridors , and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door - keepers or the coolness of his colleagues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone held the accusing paper , but , as usual , no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length an honorable peer , morcerf s acknowledged enemy , ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was an impressive silence; morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the article having been read during the painful hush that followed , a universal shudder pervaded the assembly , and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case; it was the honor of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf , and that of the whole house , he proposed to defend , by provoking a debate on personal questions , which are always such painful themes of discussion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this timidity , which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt , conciliated some in his favor; for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the president put it to the vote , and it was decided that the investigation should take place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , that i could , instead of taking up this defence , shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i demand , then , that the examination shall take place as soon as possible , and i will furnish the house with all necessary information . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what day do you fix? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - today i am at your service , replied the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the president rang the bell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - does the house approve that the examination should take place today? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morcerf asked leave to retire; he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm , which his sagacity had foreseen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated; his story , however , had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert listened , trembling now with hope , then with anger , and then again with shame , for from beauchamp s confidence he knew his father was guilty , and he asked himself how , since he was guilty , he could prove his innocence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what next? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my friend , you impose a painful task on me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> must you know all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - absolutely; and rather from your lips than another s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - muster up all your courage , then , for never have you required it more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thought himself strong enough , for he mistook fever for energy . </s> </s>

<s> <s> many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him; many others said he would not appear; while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels; and others went to the police - office to inquire if he had taken out a passport . </s> </s>

<s> <s> de morcerf entered at the last stroke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he held some papers in his hand; his countenance was calm , and his step firm , and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform , which was buttoned completely up to the chin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his presence produced a good effect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the committee was made up of liberals , several of whom came forward to shake hands with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at this moment one of the door - keepers brought in a letter for the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf ,  said the president , as he unsealed the letter; and the count began his defence , i assure you , albert , in a most eloquent and skilful manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence , since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unfortunately , the negotiation failed , and when he returned to defend his benefactor , he was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but ,  said the count , so great was ali pasha s confidence , that on his death - bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what effect did this discourse produce? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i acknowledge it affected me , and , indeed , all the committee also , said beauchamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - meanwhile , the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him; but the first lines aroused his attention; he read them again and again , and fixing his eyes on m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on my return , vasiliki and her daughter hayde had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was not rich; my life was in constant danger; i could not seek them , to my great regret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the president frowned imperceptibly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gentlemen ,  said he , you have heard the comte de morcerf s defence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can you , sir , produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?  alas , no , monsieur ,  replied the count; all those who surrounded the vizier , or who knew me at his court , are either dead or gone away , i know not where . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i believe that i alone , of all my countrymen , survived that dreadful war . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it only remained to put it to the vote , when the president resumed: gentlemen and you , monsieur ,you will not be displeased , i presume , to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness , and who has just presented himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is , doubtless , come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here is a letter i have just received on the subject; shall it be read , or shall it be passed over? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and shall we take no notice of this incident?   m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf turned pale , and clenched his hands on the papers he held . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the committee decided to hear the letter; the count was thoughtful and silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> president ,i can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the lieutenant - general the count of morcerf in epirus and in macedonia with important particulars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> proceed ,  was heard on all sides . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was present during his last moments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know what is become of vasiliki and hayde . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am at the command of the committee , and even claim the honor of being heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - and who is this witness , or rather this enemy?   asked the count , in a tone in which there was a visible alteration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is the committee willing to hear this witness?  yes , yes ,  they all said at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door - keeper was called . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is there anyone in the lobby?   said the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who is it?  a woman , accompanied by a servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  everyone looked at his neighbor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bring her in ,  said the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the president requested her to throw aside her veil , and it was then seen that she was dressed in the grecian costume , and was remarkably beautiful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said albert ,  - it was she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hayde . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who told you that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , i guess it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see i am calm and strong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet we must be drawing near the disclosure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious , that the interest they had felt for the count s safety became now quite a secondary matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady; but she declined availing herself of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the count , he had fallen on his chair; it was evident that his legs refused to support him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but allow me to say that you must have been very young then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and who are you , that they should have made so deep an impression on you?  on them depended my father s life ,  replied she . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman , the brilliancy of her eye , and her highly important communication , produced an indescribable effect on the assembly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the count , he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it had been supposed some of the papers might be in the arabian , romaic , or turkish language , and the interpreter of the house was in attendance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the noble peers , who was familiar with the arabic language , having studied it during the famous egyptian campaign , followed with his eye as the translator read aloud: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the above - mentioned purchase was made on his highness s account , whose mandate i had , for the sum of four hundred thousand francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - given at constantinople , by authority of his highness , in the year 1247 of the hegira . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - signed , el - kobbir . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - that this record should have all due authority , it shall bear the imperial seal , which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - near the merchant s signature there was , indeed , the seal of the sublime emperor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a dreadful silence followed the reading of this document; the count could only stare , and his gaze , fixed as if unconsciously on hayde , seemed one of fire and blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame ,  said the president , may reference be made to the count of monte cristo , who is now , i believe , in paris?  <s> <s>  - sir ,  replied hayde , the count of monte cristo , my foster - father , has been in normandy the last three days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although a christian , may god forgive me , i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since i set my foot in france , and knew the traitor lived in paris , i have watched carefully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i live retired in the house of my noble protector , but i do it from choice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i love retirement and silence , because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the count of monte cristo surrounds me with every paternal care , and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - then ,  remarked the president , the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedings?  he is quite unaware of them , and i have but one fear , which is that he should disapprove of what i have done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it is a glorious day for me ,  continued the young girl , raising her ardent gaze to heaven , that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father!  <s> <s>  - the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his colleagues looked at him , and doubtless pitied his prospects , blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  hayde , whose eyes had been fixed on the door , as if expecting someone , turned hastily , and , seeing the count standing , shrieked , you do not know me?   said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are fernand mondego , the french officer who led the troops of my noble father! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is you who surrendered the castle of yanina! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is you who , with that mandate , obtained the pasha s ring , which gave you authority over selim , the fire - keeper! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look , gentlemen , all!  <s> <s>  - these words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth , that every eye was fixed on the count s forehead , and he himself passed his hand across it , as if he felt ali s blood still lingering there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you positively recognize m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf as the officer , fernand mondego?  indeed i do!   cried hayde . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , my mother , it was you who said ,  - you were free , you had a beloved father , you were destined to be almost a queen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look well at that man; it is he who raised your father s head on the point of a spear; it is he who sold us; it is he who forsook us! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , let him say now if he does not recognize me!   each word fell like a dagger on morcerf , and deprived him of a portion of his energy; as she uttered the last , he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom , and fell back on his seat , overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall further inquiries be made? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall two members of the house be sent to yanina? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> speak!   morcerf did not reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they knew the count s energetic and violent temper; it must be , indeed , a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery outburst . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well ,  asked the president , what is your decision?  <s> <s>  - i have no reply to make ,  said the count in a low tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling , but withdrew then , immediately , as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven , and that other judge named god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , with a hasty movement , he tore open his coat , which seemed to stifle him , and flew from the room like a madman; his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor , then the rattling of his carriage - wheels as he was driven rapidly away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gentlemen ,  said the president , when silence was restored , is the count of morcerf convicted of felony , treason , and conduct unbecoming a member of this house?  yes ,  replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she heard the count s sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity; then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors , and left with that dignified step which virgil attributes to his goddesses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , continued beauchamp ,  - i took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , albert , from whatever source the blow may have proceededit may be from an enemy , but that enemy is only the agent of providence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert held his head between his hands; he raised his face , red with shame and bathed in tears , and seizing beauchamp s arm: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friend , said he ,  - my life is ended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot calmly say with you , providence has struck the blow;  but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred , and when i have found him i shall kill him , or he will kill me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i rely on your friendship to assist me , beauchamp , if contempt has not banished it from your heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - contempt , my friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how does this misfortune affect you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father s actions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> review your life , albert; although it is only just beginning , did a lovely summer s day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , albert , take my advice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are young and richleave parisall is soon forgotten in this great babylon of excitement and changing tastes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will return after three or four years with a russian princess for a bride , and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , my dear beauchamp , thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice; but it cannot be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have told you my wish , or rather my determination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you understand that , interested as i am in this affair , i cannot see it in the same light as you do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source , seems to me to proceed from one far less pure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , i repeat , beauchamp , i wish to return to human and material existence , and if you are still the friend you profess to be , help me to discover the hand that struck the blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be it so , said beauchamp;  - if you must have me descend to earth , i submit; and if you will seek your enemy , i will assist you , and i will engage to find him , my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , you understand , beauchamp , that we begin our search immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the calumniator is not yet punished , and he may hope that he will not be; but , on my honor , if he thinks so , he deceives himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me; satisfy my impatience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i will tell you what i did not like to mention on my return from yanina . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - say on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i went , of course , to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the first word , before i had even mentioned your father s name<s> <s>  - ah ,  said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i guess what brings you here . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - how , and why?  <s> <s>  - because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - by whom?  <s> <s>  - by a banker of paris , my correspondent . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - whose name is <s> <s>  - danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - make inquiries , albert , but do not be angry without reason; make inquiries , and if it be true<s> <s>  - oh , yes , if it be true , cried the young man ,  - he shall pay me all i have suffered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - beware , morcerf , he is already an old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , no , he was afraid to encounter him face to face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> act prudently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , do not fear; besides , you will accompany me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp , solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before this day closes , if m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars is guilty , he shall cease to live , or i shall die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pardieu , beauchamp , mine shall be a splendid funeral! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when such resolutions are made , albert , they should be promptly executed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you wish to go to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us go immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they sent for a cabriolet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on entering the banker s mansion , they perceived the phaeton and servant of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servant announced the young man; but the banker , recollecting what had transpired the day before , did not wish him admitted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was , however , too late; albert had followed the footman , and , hearing the order given , forced the door open , and followed by beauchamp found himself in the banker s study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , cried the latter ,  - am i no longer at liberty to receive whom i choose in my house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir , said albert , coldly;  - there are circumstances in which one cannot , except through cowardice ,i offer you that refuge ,refuse to admit certain persons at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i mean , said albert , drawing near , and without apparently noticing cavalcanti , who stood with his back towards the fireplace - i mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes; that will be sufficientwhere two men having met , one of them will remain on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars turned pale; cavalcanti moved a step forward , and albert turned towards him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you , too , said he ,  - come , if you like , monsieur; you have a claim , being almost one of the family , and i will give as many rendezvous of that kind as i can find persons willing to accept them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti looked at danglars with a stupefied air , and the latter , making an effort , arose and stepped between the two young men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , sir , said he to albert ,  - if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because i have preferred him to you , i shall resign the case to the king s attorney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , miserable wretch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried morcerf ,  - it is your fault . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my fault? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he;  - you must be mad! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have i travelled in that country? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did i advise your father to sell the castle of yaninato betray<s> <s>  - silence! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert , with a thundering voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us , but you hypocritically provoked it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i suppose you read it in the paper in the account from yanina? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who wrote for particulars concerning my father? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but one person only wrote! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one only? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i , doubtless , wrote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man , it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family; it is not only a right , but a duty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you wrote , sir , knowing what answer you would receive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i , indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i assure you , cried danglars , with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man ,  - i solemnly declare to you , that i should never have thought of writing to yanina , did i know anything of ali pasha s misfortunes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pardieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i said the origin of his fortune remained obscure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i answered , in greece . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then ,  said he , write to yanina . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - and who thus advised you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no other than your friend , monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count of monte cristo told you to write to yanina? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; and i wrote , and will show you my correspondence , if you like . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said beauchamp , who had not yet spoken ,  - you appear to accuse the count , who is absent from paris at this moment , and cannot justify himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i accuse no one , sir , said danglars;  - i relate , and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - does the count know what answer you received? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; i showed it to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did he know my father s christian name was fernand , and his family name mondego? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i had told him that long since , and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances , and perhaps less . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when , the day after the arrival of this answer , your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughter s hand for you , i decidedly refused him , but without any explanation or exposure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how did the honor or disgrace of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf affect me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it neither increased nor decreased my income . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert felt the blood mounting to his brow; there was no doubt upon the subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars defended himself with the baseness , but at the same time with the assurance , of a man who speaks the truth , at least in part , if not whollynot for conscience  sake , but through fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty; it was a man who would answer for the offence , whether trifling or serious; it was a man who would fight , and it was evident danglars would not fight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in addition to this , everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo knew everything , as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha; and , knowing everything , he had advised danglars to write to yanina . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the answer known , he had yielded to albert s wish to be introduced to hayde , and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali , and had not opposed hayde s recital ( but having , doubtless , warned the young girl , in the few romaic words he spoke to her , not to implicate morcerf s father ) . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged; monte cristo then was in league with his father s enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert took beauchamp aside , and communicated these ideas to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair , and it is of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert turned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said he to danglars ,  - understand that i do not take a final leave of you; i must ascertain if your insinuations are just , and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , said he;  - just now i told you it was of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - reflect , morcerf , one moment before you go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on what shall i reflect? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on the importance of the step you are taking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars is a money - lover , and those who love money , you know , think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other is , on the contrary , to all appearance a true nobleman; but do you not fear to find him a bully? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not be alarmed , said beauchamp;  - he will meet you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my only fear is that he will be too strong for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the happiest thing that could occur to me , would be to die in my father s stead; that would save us all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your mother would die of grief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert , passing his hand across his eyes ,  - i know she would; but better so than die of shame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you quite decided , albert? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but do you think we shall find the count at home? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he intended returning some hours after me , and doubtless he is now at home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they ordered the driver to take them to no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 30 champs - lyses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp wished to go in alone , but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert sprang from the porter s lodge to the steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was received by baptistin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count had , indeed , just arrived , but he was in his bath , and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but after his bath? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my master will go to dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and after dinner? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he will sleep an hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is going to the opera . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you sure of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - quite , sir; my master has ordered his horses at eight o clock precisely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very good , replied albert;  - that is all i wished to know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , turning towards beauchamp ,  - if you have anything to attend to , beauchamp , do it directly; if you have any appointment for this evening , defer it till tomorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i depend on you to accompany me to the opera; and if you can , bring chteau - renaud with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp availed himself of albert s permission , and left him , promising to call for him at a quarter before eight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went to see his mother , who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone , and had kept her room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mercds; she pressed her son s hand and sobbed aloud , but her tears relieved her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear mother , said he ,  - do you know if m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf has any enemy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds started; she noticed that the young man did not say  - my father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know it , and appeal to your penetration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are of so superior a mind , nothing escapes you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why do you say so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because , for instance , you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave , that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo would eat nothing in our house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she exclaimed;  - and how is he connected with the question you asked me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know , mother , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo is almost an oriental , and it is customary with the orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you say m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo is our enemy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied mercds , becoming paler than the sheet which covered her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who told you so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , you are mad , albert! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo has only shown us kindness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo saved your life; you yourself presented him to us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , i entreat you , my son , if you had entertained such an idea , dispel it; and my counsel to younay , my prayeris to retain his friendship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mercds , blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale , and again becoming paler than ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds shuddered , and , fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze ,  - you speak strangely , said she to albert ,  - and you appear to have some singular prejudices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what has the count done? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert was silent; an instant after , the countess resumed: </s> </s>

<s> <s> scarcely had he shut her door , when mercds called a confidential servant , and ordered him to follow albert wherever he should go that evening , and to come and tell her immediately what he observed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she rang for her lady s maid , and , weak as she was , she dressed , in order to be ready for whatever might happen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at ten minutes to eight beauchamp arrived; he had seen chteau - renaud , who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that chteau - renaud did not seek to dissuade him , and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at last , as albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time , at the beginning of the second act the door opened , and monte cristo entered , dressed in black , and , leaning over the front of the box , looked around the pit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without communicating his thoughts to his companion , he sat down , drew out his opera - glass , and looked another way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although apparently not noticing albert , he did not , however , lose sight of him , and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act , he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes , and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel , but he was well prepared for what might happen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door opened , and monte cristo , turning round , saw albert , pale and trembling , followed by beauchamp and chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , cried he , with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world ,  - my cavalier has attained his object . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the countenance of this man , who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings , expressed the most perfect cordiality . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - an explanation at the opera? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count , with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians , i should not have thought this the place for such a demand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not difficult of access , sir; for yesterday , if my memory does not deceive me , you were at my house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yesterday i was at your house , sir , said the young man;  - because then i knew not who you were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where are you come from , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  said monte cristo  - you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - provided i understand your perfidy , sir , and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged , i shall be reasonable enough , said albert furiously . </s> </s>

<s> <s> wild , almost unconscious , and with eyes inflamed , albert stepped back , and morrel closed the door . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - what shall i do with albert? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as certainly , maximilian , as i now press your hand , i shall kill him before ten o clock tomorrow morning . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the curtain , which had risen at the close of the scene with albert , again fell , and a rap was heard at the door . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and having done so , entirely on my own account , be it understood , i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it is desirable i should know the real cause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is to say , you would rather not? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - hush , the curtain is rising . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never lose a note of this opera if i can avoid it; the music of william tell is so sweet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo waited , according to his usual custom , until duprez had sung his famous  - suivez - moi! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel took leave of him at the door , renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven o clock , and to bring emmanuel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one who knew the count could mistake his expression when , on entering , he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali brought the box to his master , who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these were pistols of an especial pattern , which monte cristo had had made for target practice in his own room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet , and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was , as sportsmen would say , keeping his hand in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> baptistin looked at his master , who made a sign to him , and he went out , closing the door after him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who are you , madame? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count to the veiled woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger cast one look around her , to be certain that they were quite alone; then bending as if she would have knelt , and joining her hands , she said with an accent of despair: </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - fernand , do you mean? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you see , edmond , i am not mistaken , and have cause to say , spare my son!  <s> <s>  - and who told you , madame , that i have any hostile intentions against your son? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no one , in truth; but a mother has twofold sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i guessed all; i followed him this evening to the opera , and , concealed in a parquet box , have seen all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if morrel , one of my friends , had not stopped him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame , you are mistaken , they are not misfortunes ,it is a punishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not i who strike m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and why do you represent providence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are yanina and its vizier to you , edmond? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , madame , replied monte cristo ,  - all this is an affair between the french captain and the daughter of vasiliki . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , sir! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , exclaimed monte cristo ,  - why was i absent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because you had been arrested , edmond , and were a prisoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and why was i arrested? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know , said mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you do not , madame; at least , i hope not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i will tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was arrested and became a prisoner because , under the arbor of la rserve , the day before i was to marry you , a man named danglars wrote this letter , which the fisherman fernand himself posted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo went to a secretaire , opened a drawer by a spring , from which he took a paper which had lost its original color , and the ink of which had become of a rusty huethis he placed in the hands of mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was danglars  letter to the king s attorney , which the count of monte cristo , disguised as a clerk from the house of thomson & french , had taken from the file against edmond dants , on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds read with terror the following lines: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above - mentioned edmond dants , who either carries the letter for paris about with him , or has it at his father s abode . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> should it not be found in possession of either father or son , then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dants on board the pharaon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how dreadful! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you do not know that i remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you , in a dungeon in the chteau d if . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you do not know that every day of those fourteen years i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day; and yet i was not aware that you had married fernand , my calumniator , and that my father had died of hunger! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried mercds , shuddering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is what i heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after i had entered it; and that is why , on account of the living mercds and my deceased father , i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand , andi have revenged myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> compared with such things , what is the letter you have just read? a lover s deception , which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive; but not so the lover who was to have married her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor woman s head and arms fell; her legs bent under her , and she fell on her knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her forehead almost touched the carpet , when the count sprang forward and raised her . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - not crush that accursed race? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mercds! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , mercds , i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy , with the groan of sorrow , with the last effort of despair; i have uttered it when frozen with cold , crouched on the straw in my dungeon; i have uttered it , consumed with heat , rolling on the stone floor of my prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds , i must revenge myself , for i suffered fourteen years ,fourteen years i wept , i cursed; now i tell you , mercds , i must revenge myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - revenge yourself , then , edmond , cried the poor mother;  - but let your vengeance fall on the culprits ,on him , on me , but not on my son! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since god himself dictated those words to his prophet , why should i seek to make myself better than god? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - edmond , continued mercds , with her arms extended towards the count ,  - since i first knew you , i have adored your name , have respected your memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond , my friend , do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edmond , if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what could i do for you , edmond , besides pray and weep? </s> </s>

<s> <s> i had been told that you had endeavored to escape; that you had taken the place of another prisoner; that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body; that you had been thrown alive from the top of the chteau d if , and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , edmond , i swear to you , by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pity ,edmond , for ten years i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy , and for ten years i heard every night the cry which awoke me , shuddering and cold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and i , too , edmondoh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> believe meguilty as i wasoh , yes , i , too , have suffered much! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried monte cristo , thrusting his hands into his hair;  - have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival , while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , interrupted mercds ,  - but i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you ask of me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he , - your son s life? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , he shall live! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said she , seizing the count s hand and raising it to her lips;  - oh , thank you , thank you , edmond! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now you are exactly what i dreamt you were ,the man i always loved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , now i may say so! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so much the better , replied monte cristo;  - as that poor edmond will not have long to be loved by you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> death is about to return to the tomb , the phantom to retire in darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you say , edmond? </s> </s>

<s> <s> and why so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who talks of dying? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but the duel will not take place , edmond , since you forgive? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it will take place , said monte cristo , in a most solemn tone;  - but instead of your son s blood to stain the ground , mine will flow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while waiting his assistance i trust to your word; you have said that my son should live , have you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , madame , he shall live , said monte cristo , surprised that without more emotion mercds had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds extended her hand to the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , believe me , edmond , as i told you , i too have suffered much; i repeat , it is melancholy to pass one s life without having one joy to recall , without preserving a single hope; but that proves that all is not yet over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , i repeat it , edmond; what you have just done is beautifulit is grand; it is sublime . </s> </s>

<s> <s> suppose that the supreme being , after having created the world and fertilized chaos , had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes; suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for god to look upon his work and see that it was goodsuppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal nighttheneven then , mercds , you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my life at this moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands , as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - edmond , said mercds ,  - i have but one word more to say to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count smiled bitterly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs - lyses , and made monte cristo raise his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a fool i was , said he ,  - not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after mercds had left monte cristo , he fell into profound gloom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped; his energetic mind slumbered , as the body does after extreme fatigue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he to himself , while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out , and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom;  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this edifice which i have been so long preparing , which i have reared with so much care and toil , is to be crushed by a single touch , a word , a breath! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , this self , of whom i thought so much , of whom i was so proud , who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the chteau d if , and whom i had succeeded in making so great , will be but a lump of clay tomorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas , it is not the death of the body i regret; for is not the destruction of the vital principle , the repose to which everything is tending , to which every unhappy being aspires ,is not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed , and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one step farther into rest ,two , perhaps , into silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , it is not existence , then , that i regret , but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out , so laboriously framed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not god s will that they should be accomplished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this burden , almost as heavy as a world , which i had raised , and i had thought to bear to the end , was too great for my strength , and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and all thisall this , because my heart , which i thought dead , was only sleeping; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again , because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman s voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yet , continued the count , becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow , which mercds had accepted ,  - yet , it is impossible that so noble - minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength; it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love , or rather delirium . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , she must have conceived some pathetic scene; she will come and throw herself between us; and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the blush of pride mounted to the count s forehead as this thought passed through his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ridiculous? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated he;  - and the ridicule will fall on me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ridiculous? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , i would rather die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill - fortune of the next day , to which he had condemned himself by promising mercds to spare her son , the count at last exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - folly , folly , folly! to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it must be; it shall be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seizing a pen , he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk , and wrote at the bottom of the document ( which was no other than his will , made since his arrival in paris ) a sort of codicil , clearly explaining the nature of his death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance , and other wretches , like morcerf , danglars , villefort , even morcerf himself , must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let them know , on the contrary , that their punishment , which had been decreed by providence , is only delayed by my present determination , and although they escape it in this world , it awaits them in another , and that they are only exchanging time for eternity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties ,wretched waking dreams of grief ,the first rays of morning pierced his windows , and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned his head , looked around him , and saw no one; but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had been standing at the door , to prevent his going out without seeing her , until sleep , which the young cannot resist , had overpowered her frame , wearied as she was with watching . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the noise of the door did not awaken her , and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , shaking his head sorrowfully ,  - poor hayde , said he;  - she wished to see me , to speak to me; she has feared or guessed something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he quietly regained his seat , and wrote under the other lines: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i bequeath to maximilian morrel , captain of spahis ,and son of my former patron , pierre morrel , shipowner at marseilles ,the sum of twenty millions , a part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brother - in - law emmanuel , if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at monte cristo , of which bertuccio knows the secret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if his heart is free , and he will marry hayde , the daughter of ali pasha of yanina , whom i have brought up with the love of a father , and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me , he will thus accomplish my last wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this will has already constituted hayde heiress of the rest of my fortune , consisting of lands , funds in england , austria , and holland , furniture in my different palaces and houses , and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants , may still amount to sixty millions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my lord , said she ,  - why are you writing thus at such an hour? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the young girl , with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before , and which startled him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , if any misfortune happen to me , replied monte cristo ,  - i wish my daughter to be happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hayde smiled sorrowfully , and shook her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think of dying , my lord? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the wise man , my child , has said , it is good to think of death . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - well , if you die , said she ,  - bequeath your fortune to others , for if you die i shall require nothing; and , taking the paper , she tore it in four pieces , and threw it into the middle of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , the effort having exhausted her strength , she fell , not asleep this time , but fainting on the floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms; and seeing that sweet pale face , those lovely eyes closed , that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless , the idea occurred to him for the first time , that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he carried hayde to her room , resigned her to the care of her attendants , and returning to his study , which he shut quickly this time , he again copied the destroyed will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he was finishing , the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo approached the window , and saw maximilian and emmanuel alight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good , said he;  - it was time ,and he sealed his will with three seals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing - room , and went to open the door himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am perhaps come too soon , count , said he ,  - but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eyes all night , nor has anyone in my house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance , to recover myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - morrel , said he ,  - it is a happy day for me , to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good - morning , emmanuel; you will come with me then , maximilian? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the young captain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but if i were wrong<s> <s>  - i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday; i have been thinking of your firmness all night , and i said to myself that justice must be on your side , or man s countenance is no longer to be relied on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , morrel , albert is your friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you met on the same day you first saw me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , that is true; but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he to ali , who came immediately ,  - take that to my solicitor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i am dead , you will go and examine it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; must i not be prepared for everything , dear friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what did you do yesterday after you left me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i went to tortoni s , where , as i expected , i found beauchamp and chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i own i was seeking them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , when all was arranged? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , count; the affair is serious and unavoidable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; the offence was public , and everyone is already talking of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you succeeded? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monte cristo quickly , with an imperceptible gleam of hope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah? who has betrayed me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you failed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they positively refused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - morrel , said the count ,  - have you ever seen me fire a pistol? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at each shot morrel turned pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat , and saw that they were no larger than buckshot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is astonishing , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look , emmanuel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then turning towards monte cristo ,  - count , said he ,  - in the name of all that is dear to you , i entreat you not to kill albert! the unhappy youth has a mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are right , said monte cristo;  - and i have none . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these words were uttered in a tone which made morrel shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are the offended party , count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doubtless; what does that imply? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that you will fire first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i fire first? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i obtained , or rather claimed that; we had conceded enough for them to yield us that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - twenty paces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a smile of terrible import passed over the count s lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - morrel , said he ,  - do not forget what you have just seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the only chance for albert s safety , then , will arise from your emotion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i suffer from emotion? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - or from your generosity , my friend; to so good a marksman as you are , i may say what would appear absurd to another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will tell you , morrel , said the count ,  - that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as i told you , my dear morrel , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf will kill me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel looked at him in utter amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what has happened , then , since last evening , count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the same thing that happened to brutus the night before the battle of philippi; i have seen a ghost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that ghost<s> <s>  - told me , morrel , that i had lived long enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo drew out his watch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a carriage was in readiness at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo stepped into it with his two friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door , and maximilian and emmanuel , who had considerately passed forward a few steps , thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage , and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter retained the count s hand between his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i like , said he ,  - to feel a hand like this , when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems to me , said emmanuel ,  - that i see two young men down there , who are evidently , waiting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother - in - law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not seek your confidence , my dear friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i only ask you a simple question; answer it;that is all i require . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you love her much? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - another hope defeated! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to tell the truth , count , if i knew less of you , i should think that you were less brave than you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because i sigh when thinking of someone i am leaving? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , morrel , it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do i regret life? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is it to me , who have passed twenty years between life and death? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , do not alarm yourself , morrel; this weakness , if it is such , is betrayed to you alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know the world is a drawing - room , from which we must retire politely and honestly; that is , with a bow , and our debts of honor paid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is to the purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you brought your arms? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i? what for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope these gentlemen have theirs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will inquire , said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do; but make no treatyyou understand me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you need not fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the three young men bowed to each other courteously , if not affably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excuse me , gentlemen , said morrel ,  - but i do not see m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he sent us word this morning , replied chteau - renaud ,  - that he would meet us on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp pulled out his watch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is a carriage coming , said chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are doubtless provided with pistols , gentlemen? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo yields his right of using his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count , said beauchamp ,  - and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten days since , thinking to want them on a similar occasion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are quite new , and have not yet been used . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf does not know these pistols , you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentlemen , said chteau - renaud ,  - it is not morcerf coming in that carriage;faith , it is franz and debray! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what chance brings you here , gentlemen? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because , said debray ,  - albert sent this morning to request us to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp and chteau - renaud exchanged looks of astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think i understand his reason , said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf , begging me to attend the opera . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i , said debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i also , said franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and we , too , added beauchamp and chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - having wished you all to witness the challenge , he now wishes you to be present at the combat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , after all these arrangements , he does not come himself , said chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there he comes , said beauchamp ,  - on horseback , at full gallop , followed by a servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how imprudent , said chteau - renaud ,  - to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols , after all the instructions i had given him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he jumped from his horse , threw the bridle on his servant s arms , and joined them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was pale , and his eyes were red and swollen; it was evident that he had not slept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance , which was not natural to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thank you , gentlemen , said he ,  - for having complied with my request; i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached , and remained at a short distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and to you also , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , there cannot be too many . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so much the better; the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , said chteau - renaud ,  - will you apprise the count of monte cristo that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf is arrived , and we are at his disposal? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stop , gentlemen , said albert;  - i have two words to say to the count of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir; before all who are here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert s witnesses looked at each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper , and morrel , rejoiced at this unexpected incident , went to fetch the count , who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what does he want with me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know , but he wishes to speak to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo ,  - i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count advanced , accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to albert s grief - stricken face , who approached also , followed by the other four young men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when at three paces distant from each other , albert and the count stopped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - approach , gentlemen , said albert;  - i wish you not to lose one word of what i am about to have the honor of saying to the count of monte cristo , for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it , strange as it may appear to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said albert , at first with a tremulous voice , but which gradually became firmer ,  - i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf in epirus , for guilty as i knew he was , i thought you had no right to punish him; but i have since learned that you had that right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not fernand mondego s treachery towards ali pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you , but the treachery of the fisherman fernand towards you , and the almost unheard - of miseries which were its consequences; and i say , and proclaim it publicly , that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father , and i , his son , thank you for not using greater severity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene , it would not have surprised them more than did albert s declaration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for monte cristo , his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could not understand how albert s fiery nature , of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits , had suddenly stooped to this humiliation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he recognized the influence of mercds , and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , sir , said albert ,  - if you think my apology sufficient , pray give me your hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess , i rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this confession concerns me only . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i acted well as a man , but you have acted better than man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an angel alone could have saved one of us from deaththat angel came from heaven , if not to make us friends ( which , alas , fatality renders impossible ) , at least to make us esteem each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentlemen , said he ,  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hasty actions are generally bad ones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now my fault is repaired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me , added he , drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies ,  - i shall endeavor to correct his mistake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what happened during the night? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked beauchamp of chteau - renaud;  - we appear to make a very sorry figure here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said debray to franz . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf , and is justified by his son! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for monte cristo , his head was bent down , his arms were powerless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bowing under the weight of twenty - four years  reminiscences , he thought not of albert , of beauchamp , of chteau - renaud , or of any of that group; but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son s life , to whom he had offered his , and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret , capable of destroying forever in that young man s heart every feeling of filial piety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count of monte cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile , and got into his carriage with maximilian and emmanuel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert , beauchamp , and chteau - renaud remained alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert looked at his two friends , not timidly , but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , my dear friend , said beauchamp first , who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation ,  - allow me to congratulate you; this is a very unhoped - for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he , after this embarrassing silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when you please , replied beauchamp;  - allow me only to compliment m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , said chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - assuredly; as for me , i should have been incapable of it , said chteau - renaud , with most significant coolness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentlemen , interrupted albert ,  - i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo and myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> may i give you a friendly counsel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> set out for naples , the hague , or st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> petersburgcalm countries , where the point of honor is better understood than among our hot - headed parisians . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seek quietude and oblivion , so that you may return peaceably to france after a few years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> am i not right , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is deeply engraved on my heart , and , after what you have just said , i remember that only . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> chteau - renaud and beauchamp looked at each other; the impression was the same on both of them , and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - bye , albert , said beauchamp suddenly , carelessly extending his hand to the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy; in fact , he did not notice the offered hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - bye , said chteau - renaud in his turn , keeping his little cane in his left hand , and saluting with his right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert s lips scarcely whispered  - good - bye , but his look was more explicit; it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger , proud disdain , and generous indignation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage; then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it , he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he alighted , he thought he saw his father s pale face behind the curtain of the count s bedroom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy; he looked at the pictures , whose faces seemed to smile , and the landscapes , which appeared painted in brighter colors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he arranged all his beautiful turkish arms , his fine english guns , his japanese china , his cups mounted in silver , his artistic bronzes by feuchres or barye; examined the cupboards , and placed the key in each; threw into a drawer of his secretaire , which he left open , all the pocket - money he had about him , and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel - boxes; then he made an exact inventory of everything , and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table , after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you want? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he , with a more sorrowful than angry tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pardon me , sir , replied the valet;  - you had forbidden me to disturb you , but the count of morcerf has called me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did not like to go to him without first seeing you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i shall say the duel did not take place? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he was finishing this work , the sound of horses prancing in the yard , and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window , attracted his attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he approached the window , and saw his father get into it , and drive away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert saw all these preparations and understood them , and exclaiming ,  - my mother! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he threw his arms around her neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all these proofs of an energetic resolution , which albert did not fear on his own account , alarmed him for his mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what are you doing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my mother! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i also , replied mercds ,  - am going , and i acknowledge i had depended on your accompanying me; have i deceived myself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i cannot make you share the fate i have planned for myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must live henceforth without rank and fortune , and to begin this hard apprenticeship i must borrow from a friend the loaf i shall eat until i have earned one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , my dear mother , i am going at once to ask franz to lend me the small sum i shall require to supply my present wants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , do not say so; it will break my resolutions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but not mine , mother , replied albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas , my dear mother , some have suffered so much , and yet live , and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made themon the fragments of all the hope which god had given them! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , mother; from this moment i have done with the past , and accept nothing from itnot even a name , because you can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - albert , my child , said mercds ,  - if i had a stronger heart , that is the counsel i would have given you; your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak; listen to its dictates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you had friends , albert; break off their acquaintance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do not despair; you have life before you , my dear albert , for you are yet scarcely twenty - two years old; and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name , take my father sit was herrera . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am sure , my dear albert , whatever may be your career , you will soon render that name illustrious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , my son , return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows; and if i am wrong , still let me cherish these hopes , for i have no future to look forward to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , since our resolution is formed , let us act promptly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf went out about half an hour ago; the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert ran to fetch a carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the carriage stopped at the door , and albert was alighting , a man approached and gave him a letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert took the letter , opened , and read it , then looked round for bertuccio , but he was gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he returned to mercds with tears in his eyes and heaving breast , and without uttering a word he gave her the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds read: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - albert ,while showing you that i have discovered your plans , i hope also to convince you of my delicacy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are free , you leave the count s house , and you take your mother to your home; but reflect , albert , you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not seek to know how i discovered it; i know itthat is sufficient . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , listen , albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twenty - four years ago i returned , proud and joyful , to my country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this money was for her; i destined it for her , and , knowing the treachery of the sea i buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at marseilles , on the alles de meilhan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your mother , albert , knows that poor house well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a short time since i passed through marseilles , and went to see the old place , which revived so many painful recollections; and in the evening i took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where i had concealed my treasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , albert , this money , which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored , may now , through strange and painful circumstances , be devoted to the same purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , feel for me , who could offer millions to that poor woman , but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day i was torn from her i loved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile monte cristo had also returned to town with emmanuel and maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their return was cheerful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the barrire du trne they met bertuccio , who was waiting there , motionless as a sentinel at his post . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo put his head out of the window , exchanged a few words with him in a low tone , and the steward disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , said emmanuel , when they were at the end of the place royale ,  - put me down at my door , that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph , said morrel , i would invite the count to our house; besides that , he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so we will take leave of our friend , and let him hasten home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> return , emmanuel , to your charming wife , and present my best compliments to her; and do you , morrel , accompany me to the champs - lyses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - willingly , said maximilian;  - particularly as i have business in that quarter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked emmanuel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door was closed , and the carriage proceeded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continued morrel , answering his own thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for albert is brave , resumed morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i know he has fought two duels , said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all owing to your influence , replied monte cristo , smiling . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - an apology on the ground! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said the count mildly ,  - do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men , morrel! </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - you will breakfast with me , will you not , morrel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; i must leave you at ten o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel smiled , and shook his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - still you must breakfast somewhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now after what you told me this morning of your heart , i may believe<s> <s>  - well , count , replied morrel gayly ,  - i will not dispute it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you will not make me your confidant , maximilian? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count , in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , continued the latter ,  - since that heart is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes , it is elsewhere , and i must go and find it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go , said the count deliberately;  - go , dear friend , but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that i have some power in this world , that i am happy to use that power in the behalf of those i love , and that i love you , morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i need your assistance , and the moment arrives , i will come to you , count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i rely upon your promise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had arrived in the champs - lyses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is going to leave her house , said the steward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - florentin , his valet , thinks he is going to do the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come this way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo took bertuccio into his study , wrote the letter we have seen , and gave it to the steward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go , said he quickly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but first , let hayde be informed that i have returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every transport of a daughter finding a father , all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover , were felt by hayde during the first moments of this meeting , which she had so eagerly expected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> doubtless , although less evident , monte cristo s joy was not less intense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his eye , elate with happiness , was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of hayde , when suddenly the door opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count knit his brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said baptistin , as if that name sufficed for his excuse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact , the count s face brightened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which , asked he ,  - the viscount or the count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , exclaimed hayde ,  - is it not yet over? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know not if it is finished , my beloved child , said monte cristo , taking the young girl s hands;  - but i do know you have nothing more to fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what i have suffered , said the young girl ,  - you shall never know , my lord . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i believe you , my lord , as implicitly as if god had spoken to me , said the young girl , presenting her forehead to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once , the one violently , the other secretly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ask m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf into the drawing - room , said he to baptistin , while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he who was thus looking , without being heard or seen , probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerf s apartments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from that glass door the pale - faced man went to the count s bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained there ten minutes , motionless and dumb , listening to the beating of his own heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for him those ten minutes were very long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count s eye expanded; he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully , and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert returned safelythen the count was revenged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect , not of a downy couch , but of a tomb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as we have said , he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father s honor; but when that was done , why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was then , when the count could not see albert , that he sent for his servant , who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the coachman stooped down for his orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to the champs - lyses , said the general;  - the count of monte cristo s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the horses bounded beneath the whip; and in five minutes they stopped before the count s door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf opened the door himself , and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk , rang , and entered the open door with his servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a moment afterwards , baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo , and the latter , leading hayde aside , ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the general was pacing the room the third time when , in turning , he perceived monte cristo at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , it is m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf , said monte cristo quietly;  - i thought i had not heard aright . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , it is i , said the count , whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may i know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf so early? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yet he considered you the cause of his father s dishonor , the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doubtless you made , then , some apology or explanation? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i explained nothing , and it is he who apologized to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but to what do you attribute this conduct? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to the conviction , probably , that there was one more guilty than i . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who was that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that may be , said the count , turning pale;  - but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know it , and i expected this result . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you expected my son would be a coward? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why is he not here that i may tell him so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , replied monte cristo coldly ,  - i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go and tell m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert that , and he may know what to answer you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , no , said the general , smiling faintly ,  - i did not come for that purpose; you are right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively; that it seems as if i had always known you , and always hated you; and , in short , since the young people of the present day will not fight , it remains for us to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so much the better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you prepared? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us start , then; we need no witnesses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very true , said monte cristo;  - it is unnecessary , we know each other so well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on the contrary , said the count ,  - we know so little of each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo , with the same indomitable coolness;  - let us see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you not the captain fernand who betrayed , sold , and murdered his benefactor , ali? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , i did not say i was a stranger to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know well , demon , that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past , and that you have read , by the light of what torch i know not , every page of my life; but perhaps i may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nono , i am aware you know me; but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you call yourself , in paris , the count of monte cristo; in italy , sinbad the sailor; in malta , i forget what . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it is your real name i want to know , in the midst of your hundred names , that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight , at the moment when i plunge my sword through your heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale; his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he leaped towards a dressing - room near his bedroom , and in less than a moment , tearing off his cravat , his coat and waistcoat , he put on a sailor s jacket and hat , from beneath which rolled his long black hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he returned thus , formidable and implacable , advancing with his arms crossed on his breast , towards the general , who could not understand why he had disappeared , but who on seeing him again , and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him , drew back , and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but you guess it now , do you not? or , rather , you remember it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for , notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures , i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young againa face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercds , my betrothed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the general , with his head thrown back , hands extended , gaze fixed , looked silently at this dreadful apparition; then seeking the wall to support him , he glided along close to it until he reached the door , through which he went out backwards , uttering this single mournful , lamentable , distressing cry: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - edmond dants! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , with sighs which were unlike any human sound , he dragged himself to the door , reeled across the courtyard , and falling into the arms of his valet , he said in a voice scarcely intelligible , - home , home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants , partly recalled his senses , but the ride was short , and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two persons were coming down the stairs; he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was mercds leaning on her son s arm and leaving the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they passed close by the unhappy being , who , concealed behind the damask curtain , almost felt mercds dress brush past him , and his son s warm breath , pronouncing these words: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - courage , mother! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , this is no longer our home! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the general drew himself up , clinging to the curtain; he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard , and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window , which was broken by the explosion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villefort s; we say slowly , for morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps , but he had hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week , and he was now availing himself of that permission . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he arrived; valentine was expecting him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one at villefort s doubted that a duel would ensue from it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine , with her woman s instinct , guessed that morrel would be monte cristo s second , and from the young man s well - known courage and his great affection for the count , she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you know , maximilian , grandpapa once thought of leaving this house , and taking an apartment away from m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bravo , said maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier looked at valentine to impose silence , but she did not notice him; her looks , her eyes , her smile , were all for morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , whatever may be m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s reason , answered morrel ,  - i can readily believe it to be a good one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an excellent one , said valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he pretends the air of the faubourg saint - honor is not good for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morrel;  - in that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier may be right; you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not very , said valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you then really suffer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel quickly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , it must not be called suffering; i feel a general uneasiness , that is all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have lost my appetite , and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grandpapa says it is a panacea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine smiled , but it was evident that she suffered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian , in his devotedness , gazed silently at her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was very beautiful , but her usual pallor had increased; her eyes were more brilliant than ever , and her hands , which were generally white like mother - of - pearl , now more resembled wax , to which time was adding a yellowish hue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from valentine the young man looked towards noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl , absorbed by her affection , and he also , like morrel , followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know it is very bitter , said valentine;  - so bitter , that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , grandpapa , said valentine;  - it is so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just now , before i came down to you , i drank a glass of sugared water; i left half , because it seemed so bitter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier turned pale , and made a sign that he wished to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier watched her with evident anguish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact , the blood was rushing to the young girl s head already , her cheeks were becoming red . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , cried she , without losing any of her cheerfulness ,  - this is singular! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can t see! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did the sun shine in my eyes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the sun is not shining , said morrel , more alarmed by noirtier s expression than by valentine s indisposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he ran towards her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - cheer up , said she to noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not be alarmed , maximilian; it is nothing , and has already passed away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but listen! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said she ,  - it is madame danglars and her daughter , who have come to call on us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stay with grandpapa , maximilian; i promise you not to persuade them to stay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to madame de villefort s apartments and to hers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as she was gone , noirtier made a sign to morrel to take the dictionary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> accustomed , however , as he was to the work , he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary , so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words ,<s> <s>  - fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barrois s situation , and in noirtier s name gave that order . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servant soon returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the decanter and the glass were completely empty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why are the glass and decanter empty? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he;  - valentine said she only drank half the glassful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know , said the servant ,  - but the housemaid is in mademoiselle valentine s room: perhaps she has emptied them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servant went out , but returned almost immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mademoiselle valentine passed through the room to go to madame de villefort s , said he;  - and in passing , as she was thirsty , she drank what remained in the glass; as for the decanter , master edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from that moment the old man s eyes were fixed on the door , and did not quit it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen; they had been ushered into madame de villefort s room , who had said she would receive them there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is why valentine passed through her room , which was on a level with valentine s , and only separated from it by edward s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two ladies entered the drawing - room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> among worldly people manner is contagious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the popular banker found that it answered better than count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - allow me to present you my sincere congratulations , replied madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , said the baroness , smiling;  - speaking to you as a friend i can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars assures me that his fortune is majesticthat is his word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then , said eugnie , while turning over the leaves of madame de villefort s album ,  - add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and , said madame de villefort ,  - i need not ask you if you share that fancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eugnie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to valentine s cheeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at any rate , said she ,  - since i am to be married whether i will or not , i ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my engagement with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert de morcerf , or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the general depended much on it; he even came to force m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have had a narrow escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monsieur albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excuse me , said the implacable young girl ,  - monsieur albert claims and well deserves his share . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it appears that after having challenged m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo at the opera yesterday , he apologized on the ground today . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - impossible , said madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , my dear friend , said madame danglars , with the same simplicity we before noticed ,  - it is a fact . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i heard it from m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine also knew the truth , but she did not answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her in m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation , valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she would , indeed , have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes , when suddenly madame danglars  hand , pressed on her arm , aroused her from her lethargy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she , starting at madame danglars  touch as she would have done from an electric shock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is , my dear valentine , said the baroness ,  - that you are , doubtless , suffering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , cried eugnie ,  - you are very pale! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> artless as she was , the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave , and besides , madame de villefort came to her assistance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - retire , valentine , said she;  - you are really suffering , and these ladies will excuse you; drink a glass of pure water , it will restore you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine kissed eugnie , bowed to madame danglars , who had already risen to take her leave , and went out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile , valentine , in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand , had crossed edward s room without noticing some trick of the child , and through her own had reached the little staircase . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was within three steps of the bottom; she already heard morrel s voice , when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes , her stiffened foot missed the step , her hands had no power to hold the baluster , and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel bounded to the door , opened it , and found valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> quick as a flash , he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , what a clumsy thing i am , said she with feverish volubility;  - i don t know my way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have hurt yourself , perhaps , said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what can i do for you , valentine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine looked around her; she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtier s eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t worry , dear grandpapa , said she , endeavoring to smile;  - it is nothingit is nothing; i was giddy , that is all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - another attack of giddiness , said morrel , clasping his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , attend to it , valentine , i entreat you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but no , said valentine , - no , i tell you it is all past , and it was nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , let me tell you some news; eugnie is to be married in a week , and in three days there is to be a grand feast , a betrothal festival . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when will it be our turn to think of these things? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and do you , said valentine ,  - depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , cried morrel ,  - make haste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so long as you are not mine , valentine , i shall always think i may lose you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh , her arms stiffened and twisted , her head fell back on her chair , and she remained motionless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtier s lips , seemed to start from his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel understood it; he knew he must call assistance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man rang the bell violently; the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentine s room , and the servant who had replaced barrois , ran in at the same moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine was so pale , so cold , so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house , and they flew into the passage crying for help . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i told you so! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same moment m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort s voice was heard calling from his study ,  - what is the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel looked at noirtier who had recovered his self - command , and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances , he had taken refuge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur s footstep was heard in the passage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort sprang into the room , ran to valentine , and took her in his arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a physician , a physician ,m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried villefort;  - or rather i will go for him myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollectionthe conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saint - mran s death , recurred to him; these symptoms , to a less alarming extent , were the same which had preceded the death of barrois . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time monte cristo s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before ,  - whatever you want , morrel , come to me; i have great power . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> more rapidly than thought , he darted down the rue matignon , and thence to the avenue des champs - lyses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the porter knew him , and let him pass , only calling to him: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort pushed , or rather forced , the door open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said the doctor ,  - is it you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said villefort , closing the door after him ,  - it is i , who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> doctor , my house is accursed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the latter with apparent coolness , but with deep emotion ,  - have you another invalid? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , doctor , cried villefort , clutching his hair ,  - yes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he slowly uttered these words ,  - who is now dying in your house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your daughter! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried d avrigny with grief and surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see you were deceived , murmured the magistrate;  - come and see her , and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but let us make haste , sir; with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , this time , doctor , you shall not have to reproach me with weakness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time i will know the assassin , and will pursue him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same cabriolet which had brought villefort took them back at full speed , and at this moment morrel rapped at monte cristo s door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hearing the name of morrel , who had left him only two hours before , the count raised his head , arose , and sprang to meet him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel fell into a chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said he ,  - i came quickly; i wanted to speak to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , countthank you , said the young man , evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation;  - yes , everyone in my family is well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied the count with increased anxiety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said morrel ,  - it is true; i have but now left a house where death has just entered , to run to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you then come from m . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - oh , yes , very gloomy , my friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the persons whose conversation i overheard was the master of the house; the other , the physician . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - and what did the doctor answer? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - to poison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush , or his pallor , or the intense interest with which he listened;  - indeed , maximilian , did you hear that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said maximilian ,  - death came a third time , and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> death is now , perhaps , striking a fourth blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear friend , said monte cristo ,  - you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know the house where you heard it , or one very similar to it; a house with a garden , a master , a physician , and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths . </s> </s>

<s> <s> morrel shuddered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was something mournful , solemn , and terrible in the count s manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - besides , continued he , in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking - besides , who says that it will begin again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it has returned , count , exclaimed morrel;  - that is why i hastened to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , what do you wish me to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that morrel , starting up , cried out: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know of whom i speak , count , do you not? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - well , said the count , astonished at his perseverance , which he could not understand , and looking still more earnestly at maximilian ,  - let it begin again ,it is like the house of the atreidae;[19] god has condemned them , and they must submit to their punishment . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and must i lose the one to save the other? </s> </s>

<s> <s> monte cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion . </s> </s>

<s> <s> what was passing in that brain , so loaded with dreadful secrets? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god only knows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo raised his head once more , and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - maximilian , said he ,  - return home . </s> </s>

<s> <s> morrel , subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy monte cristo exercised over everything around him , did not endeavor to resist it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he pressed the count s hand and left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , closely watching his countenance and his lips , awaited the result of the examination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier , paler than even the young girl , more eager than villefort for the decision , was watching also intently and affectionately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - still? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried villefort;  - oh , doctor , what a dreadful word is that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said the physician ,  - i repeat it; she is still alive , and i am astonished at it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , since she lives . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it glistened with such extraordinary joy , so rich and full of thought , that the physician was struck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort went himself to find her; and d avrigny approached noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you something to tell me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i will remain with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment villefort returned , followed by the lady s maid; and after her came madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the matter , then , with this dear child? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she has just left me , and she complained of being indisposed , but i did not think seriously of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny continued to look at noirtier; he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round , his cheeks turn pale and tremble; the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said he , involuntarily following noirtier s eyes , which were fixed on madame de villefort , who repeated: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , fanny , we will put her to bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny , who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier , expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done; but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny followed the invalid , wrote a prescription , ordered villefort to take a cabriolet , go in person to a chemist s to get the prescribed medicine , bring it himself , and wait for him in his daughter s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything , he went down again to noirtier , shut the doors carefully , and after convincing himself that no one was listening: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you , said he ,  - know anything of this young lady s illness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we have no time to lose; i will question , and do you answer me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny reflected a moment; then approaching noirtier: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pardon what i am going to say , added he ,  - but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you see poor barrois die? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier raised his eyes to heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked d avrigny , placing his hand on noirtier s shoulder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think he died a natural death? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you have thought that barrois was poisoned? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked d avrigny , fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he watched the effect of this question on the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you hope? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said d avrigny , with surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes , it is true , murmured d avrigny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , turning to noirtier , - do you hope the assassin will be tried? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is no news to you , added d avrigny ,  - to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said d avrigny , struck with a sudden thought ,  - has it occurred to younoirtier did not let him finish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to prepare her system to resist poison? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by accustoming her by degrees<s> <s>  - yes , yes , yes , said noirtier , delighted to be understood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s joy continued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you have succeeded , exclaimed d avrigny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - without that precaution valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dose has been excessive , but she has only been shaken by it; and this time , at any rate , valentine will not die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here , doctor , said he ,  - is what you sent me for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - was this prepared in your presence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the procureur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you not let it go out of your hands? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny took the bottle , poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand , and swallowed them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said he ,  - let us go to valentine; i will give instructions to everyone , and you , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , will yourself see that no one deviates from them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the moment when d avrigny was returning to valentine s room , accompanied by villefort , an italian priest , of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone , hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe; but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lease was drawn up for three , six , or nine years by the new tenant , who , according to the rule of the proprietor , paid six months in advance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> workmen were immediately called in , and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we saw in a preceding chapter how madame danglars went formally to announce to madame de villefort the approaching marriage of eugnie danglars and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this formal announcement , which implied or appeared to imply , the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair , had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we beg them to take one step backward , and to transport themselves , the morning of that day of great catastrophes , into the showy , gilded salon we have before shown them , and which was the pride of its owner , baron danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this room , at about ten o clock in the morning , the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness , watching both doors , and listening to every sound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when his patience was exhausted , he called his valet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tienne , said he ,  - see why mademoiselle eugnie has asked me to meet her in the drawing - room , and why she makes me wait so long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having given this vent to his ill - humor , the baron became more calm; mademoiselle danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father , and had fixed on the gilded drawing - room as the spot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the singularity of this step , and above all its formality , had not a little surprised the banker , who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tienne soon returned from his errand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mademoiselle s lady s maid says , sir , that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette , and will be here shortly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars nodded , to signify that he was satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to the world and to his servants danglars assumed the character of the good - natured man and the indulgent father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other , so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and why in this solemn drawing - room when the study is so comfortable? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i quite understand why you ask , sir , said eugnie , making a sign that her father might be seated ,  - and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will answer them both , and contrary to the usual method , the last first , because it is the least difficult . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those gilded cashbooks , drawers locked like gates of fortresses , heaps of bank - bills , come from i know not where , and the quantities of letters from england , holland , spain , india , china , and peru , have generally a strange influence on a father s mind , and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have , therefore , chosen this drawing - room , where you see , smiling and happy in their magnificent frames , your portrait , mine , my mother s , and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i rely much on external impressions; perhaps , with regard to you , they are immaterial , but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well , replied m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you ask me why i have requested this interview; i will tell you in two words , sir; i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , indeed , sir , continued eugnie , still quite calm;  - you are astonished , i see; for since this little affair began , i have not manifested the slightest opposition , and yet i am always sure , when the opportunity arrives , to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me , and things which displease me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , this time , my tranquillity , or passiveness as philosophers say , proceeded from another source; it proceeded from a wish , like a submissive and devoted daughter ( a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl ) ,  - to practice obedience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , sir , replied eugnie ,  - i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come , i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my reason? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied the young girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , it is not that the man is more ugly , more foolish , or more disagreeable than any other; no , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men s faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not , either , that my heart is less touched by him than any other; that would be a schoolgirl s reason , which i consider quite beneath me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not then see why , without real necessity , i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has not some sage said , nothing too much ? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and another , i carry all my effects with me ? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek; one is , i believe , from phdrus , and the other from bias . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unhappy girl , unhappy girl! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unhappy girl , replied eugnie ,  - unhappy girl , do you say , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , indeed; the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the world calls me beautiful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i like a favorable reception; it expands the countenance , and those around me do not then appear so ugly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i possess a share of wit , and a certain relative sensibility , which enables me to draw from life in general , for the support of mine , all i meet with that is good , like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am your only daughter , and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the porte saint - martin and gat , who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me , at least entirely , as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and sobeing , beautiful , witty , somewhat talented , as the comic operas say , and richand that is happiness , sirwhy do you call me unhappy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - truly , my daughter , replied he with a smile ,  - you are all you boast of being , excepting one thing; i will not too hastily tell you which , but would rather leave you to guess it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eugnie looked at danglars , much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride , with which she had so superbly decked herself , should be disputed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my daughter , continued the banker ,  - you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you , who is determined she will not marry; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me , who has decided that his daughter shall marry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my daughter , continued danglars ,  - when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband , he has always some reason for wishing her to marry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i may acknowledge this to a daughter whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference , and not to impute it to me as a crime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is not to the purpose , said eugnie;  - let us speak candidly , sir; i admire candor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said danglars ,  - i can , when circumstances render it desirable , adopt your system , although it may not be my general practice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have proposed to you to marry , not for your sake , for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment ( you admire candor , and will now be satisfied , i hope ); but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible , on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eugnie became uneasy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is just as i tell you , i assure you , and you must not be angry with me , for you have sought this disclosure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you , who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti - poetic impressions and sensations . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but eugnie , instead of stooping , drew herself up under the blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exactly , my daughter; that is precisely what i mean , said danglars , almost digging his nails into his breast , while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man;  - ruinedyes , that is it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , ruined! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now it is revealed , this secret so full of horror , as the tragic poet says . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - oh , cried eugnie ,  - you are a bad physiognomist , if you imagine i deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have i not my talent left? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can i not , like pasta , malibran , grisi , acquire for myself what you would never have given me , whatever might have been your fortune , a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum , for which i shall be indebted to no one but myself; and which , instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs , with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality , will be accompanied with acclamations , with bravos , and with flowers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , i grieve not on my own account , i shall always find a resource; my books , my pencils , my piano , all the things which cost but little , and which i shall be able to procure , will remain my own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> undeceive yourself again; either i am greatly mistaken , or she has provided against the catastrophe which threatens you , and , which will pass over without affecting her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she has taken care for herself ,at least i hope so ,for her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , no , sir; from my childhood i have seen too much , and understood too much , of what has passed around me , for misfortune to have an undue power over me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from my earliest recollections , i have been beloved by no oneso much the worse; that has naturally led me to love no oneso much the betternow you have my profession of faith . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said danglars , pale with anger , which was not at all due to offended paternal love , - then , mademoiselle , you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your ruin? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i accelerate your ruin? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so much the better , i have a ray of hope left; listen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am all attention , said eugnie , looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is admirable! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you think i shall deprive you of those three millions , said danglars;  - but do not fear it . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway , the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that law once held out to the eternally deluded parisians , in the fantastic mississippi scheme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as i look at it , a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the ohio . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - no , said andrea , - no; it is useless for you to say so , count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name , my social position , and my merit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> personally , i do not know you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was , for the moment , restrained by a more muscular hand than his own , and that the restraint could not be easily broken through . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it appears so , sir , replied monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come? </s> </s>

<s> <s> then , arousing from his reverie: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , sir , i have one request to make to you , which you will understand , even if it should be disagreeable to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - proceed , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have formed an acquaintance , thanks to my good fortune , with many noted persons , and have , at least for the moment , a crowd of friends . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - then you refuse me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - decidedly; and were you my son or my brother i would refuse you in the same way . </s> </s>

<s> <s> recollect what i told you when you asked me to propose you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , i never make matches , my dear prince , it is my settled principle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  andrea bit his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , at least , you will be there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , like all paris , i shall be there too , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and will you sign the contract? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , since you will grant me no more , i must be content with what you give me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be careful; advice is worse than a service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you can give me this without compromising yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me what it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is the sum m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars himself announced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - must i receive it , or leave it in the hands of the notary? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly: your two solicitors appoint a meeting , when the contract is signed , for the next or the following day; then they exchange the two portions , for which they each give a receipt; then , when the marriage is celebrated , they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , replied monte cristo ,  - it will be the way , everybody says , of trebling your fortune in twelve months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said andrea ,  - let it be as you wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - adieu till then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of monte cristo , whose lips turned pale , but who preserved his ceremonious smile , andrea seized the count s hand , pressed it , jumped into his phaeton , and disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the four or five remaining hours before nine o clock arrived , andrea employed in riding , paying visits ,designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker s in their gayest equipages ,dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain , and in which danglars was just taking the initiative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies , famished bees , and buzzing drones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated; the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings; and all the bad taste of decorations , which had only their richness to boast of , shone in its splendor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her eyes , however , betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars was chatting at a short distance with debray , beauchamp , and chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue , was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea , on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the opera , was explaining to him rather cleverly , since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease , his future projects , and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy - five thousand livres per annum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as usual , the oldest women were the most decorated , and the ugliest the most conspicuous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if there was a beautiful lily , or a sweet rose , you had to search for it , concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban , or an aunt with a bird - of - paradise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at each moment , in the midst of the crowd , the buzzing , and the laughter , the door - keeper s voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department , respected in the army , or illustrious in the literary world , and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the moment when the hand of the massive time - piece , representing endymion asleep , pointed to nine on its golden face , and the hammer , the faithful type of mechanical thought , struck nine times , the name of the count of monte cristo resounded in its turn , and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity; his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his only jewellery was a chain , so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars at the other , and eugnie in front of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he first advanced towards the baroness , who was chatting with madame de villefort , who had come alone , valentine being still an invalid; and without turning aside , so clear was the road left for him , he passed from the baroness to eugnie , whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms , that the proud artist was quite struck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> near her was mademoiselle louise d armilly , who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for italy , which she intended immediately to make use of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars , who had advanced to meet him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having accomplished these three social duties , monte cristo stopped , looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class , which seems to say ,  - i have done my duty , now let others do theirs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea , who was in an adjoining room , had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of monte cristo , and now came forward to pay his respects to the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature; it was a gilt table supported on lions  claws . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the notaries sat down , the other remained standing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract , which half paris assembled was to sign . </s> </s>

<s> <s> danglars  riveted attention , eugnie s composure , and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as soon as it was finished , the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing - rooms; the brilliant sums , the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people , and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young lady s diamonds , which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose , had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mademoiselle danglars  charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men , and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for the ladies , it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions , they thought they did not need them for themselves , as they were beautiful enough without them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the notary solemnly took the pen , flourished it above his head , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cavalcanti , senior , then the baroness , afterwards the  - future couple , as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the baroness approached , leaning on madame de villefort s arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear , said she , as she took the pen ,  - is it not vexatious? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , in the same tone in which he would have said ,  - oh , well , what do i care? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said madame danglars , signing;  - if you are , take care , for i shall never forgive you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone listened eagerly; monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips , was about to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ladies screamed , and two or three prepared to faint . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was brought to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my valet , in examining this mournful relic , felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out; it was a letter addressed to you , baron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , indeed , to you; i succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained , replied monte cristo , amid the general outburst of amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , asked madame danglars , looking at her husband with uneasiness ,  - how could that prevent m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort<s> <s>  - in this simple way , madame , replied monte cristo;  - the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence; i therefore sent them to the king s attorney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you understand , my dear baron , that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases; it was , perhaps , some plot against you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea looked steadily at monte cristo and disappeared in the second drawing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - possibly , said danglars;  - was not this murdered man an old galley - slave? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the count;  - a felon named caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars turned slightly pale; andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but go on signing , said monte cristo;  - i perceive that my story has caused a general emotion , and i beg to apologize to you , baroness , and to mademoiselle danglars . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - call the prince; inform him that it is his turn to sign , cried danglars to one of the floorkeepers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments , qurens quem devoret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing - room , and was advancing towards danglars , preceded by a commissary of police , girded with his scarf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars uttered a scream and fainted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the matter , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which of you gentlemen , asked the magistrate , without replying to the count ,  - answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - a galley - slave , escaped from confinement at toulon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what crime has he committed? </s> </s>

<s> <s> as for the numerous servants ( more numerous that evening than usual , for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the caf de paris ) , venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected , they collected in groups in the hall , in the kitchens , or in their rooms , thinking very little of their duty , which was thus naturally interrupted . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - now , where are you going? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we can go to brussels , lige , aix - la - chapelle; then up the rhine to strasbourg . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i am looking at you; indeed you are adorable like that! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one would say you were carrying me off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and they would be right , pardieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i think you swore , eugnie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the yard was empty; the clock was striking twelve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the porter was not yet gone to bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she returned to louise , took up the portmanteau , which she had placed for a moment on the ground , and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eugnie concealed louise in an angle of the gateway , so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gate! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried she , with her finest contralto voice , and rapping at the window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> louise slid through the half - open gate like a snake , and bounded lightly forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau; then the two young girls , having told him to take it to no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for eugnie , she was as strong as a judith or a delilah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they arrived at the appointed spot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the shutter where eugnie had rapped was that of a little laundress , who had been previously warned , and was not yet gone to bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she opened the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mademoiselle , said eugnie ,  - let the porter get the post - chaise from the coach - house , and fetch some post - horses from the hotel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here are five francs for his trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , said louise ,  - i admire you , and i could almost say respect you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post - boy and horses , which were harnessed , and put in the post - chaise in a minute , while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to fontainebleau , replied eugnie with an almost masculine voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am giving them the slip , said eugnie;  - this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty; we will soon alter our direction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion , having been put in the right road , passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the barrire saint - martin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said louise , breathing freely ,  - here we are out of paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , my dear , the abduction is an accomplished fact , replied eugnie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars no longer had a daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now let us leave mademoiselle danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels , and return to poor andrea cavalcanti , so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> notwithstanding his youth , master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door , and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance , which nevertheless ought not to be omitted; in one of the rooms he crossed , the trousseau of the bride - elect was on exhibition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were caskets of diamonds , cashmere shawls , valenciennes lace , english veils , and in fact all the tempting things , the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy , and which is called the corbeille . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>[22] now , in passing through this room , andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent , but also provident , for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> furnished with this plunder , andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window , intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator , and muscular as a spartan , he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps , actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there he stopped , breathless and panting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was quite alone; on one side was the vast wilderness of the saint - lazare , on the other , paris enshrouded in darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried;  - no , not if i can use more activity than my enemies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my safety is now a mere question of speed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dull driver , smoking his pipe , was plodding along toward the limits of the faubourg saint - denis , where no doubt he ordinarily had his station . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ho , friend! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said benedetto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you want , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is your horse tired? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tired? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , yes , tired enoughhe has done nothing the whole of this blessed day! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> four wretched fares , and twenty sous over , making in all seven francs , are all that i have earned , and i ought to take ten to the owner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me what i am to do for this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a very easy thing , if your horse isn t tired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i tell you he ll go like the wind ,only tell me which way to drive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - exactly so; i merely wish to overtake one of my friends , with whom i am going to hunt tomorrow at chapelle - en - serval . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till half - past eleven; it is twelve , and , tired of waiting , he must have gone on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is likely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , will you try and overtake him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing i should like better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you do not overtake him before we reach bourget you shall have twenty francs; if not before louvres , thirty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and if we do overtake him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - forty , said andrea , after a moment s hesitation , at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who - o - o - pla! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everyone had just seen it pass; it was only five hundred , two hundred , one hundred steps in advance; at length they reached it , but it was not the friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said cavalcanti to himself ,  - if i only had that britzka , those two good post - horses , and above all the passport that carries them on! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he sighed deeply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the calash contained mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hurry , hurry! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here are thirty francs; i will sleep at the cheval rouge , and will secure a place in the first coach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good - night , friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and andrea , after placing six pieces of five francs each in the man s hand , leaped lightly on to the pathway . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum , and turned back on his road to paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the cheval rouge , but after leaning an instant against the door , and hearing the last sound of the cab , which was disappearing from view , he went on his road , and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he rested; he must be near chapelle - en - serval , where he pretended to be going . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here; it was that he might form some resolution , adopt some plan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise , one of the most open and strictly guarded in france; this was quite out of the question , especially to a man like andrea , perfectly conversant with criminal matters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sat down by the side of the moat , buried his face in his hands and reflected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ten minutes after he raised his head; his resolution was made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he threw some dust over the topcoat , which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume , and going to chapelle - en - serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the host opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> could you let me hire a horse of you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an innkeeper has always a horse to let , whether it be good or bad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs , and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this belonged to one of his friends at the caf de paris , so that the innkeeper , picking it up after andrea had left , was convinced that he had let his horse to the count of maulon , 25 rue saint - dominique , that being the name and address on the card . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> le blanc was not a fast animal , but he kept up an easy , steady pace; in three hours and a half andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from compigne , and four o clock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is an excellent tavern at compigne , well remembered by those who have ever been there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea , who had often stayed there in his rides about paris , recollected the bell and bottle inn; he turned around , saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp , and having dismissed the child , giving him all the small coin he had about him , he began knocking at the door , very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a waiter opened the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friend , said andrea ,  - i have been dining at saint - jean - aux - bois , and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight , but like a fool i have lost my way , and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court , and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while the waiter was preparing his room , the hostess arose; andrea assumed his most charming smile , and asked if he could have no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his sister . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea appeared in despair , but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 3 , and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at chantilly , he waited until they announced his room to be ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the bell hotel , which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre , with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns , forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age , even when they are torn with remorse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse , but that he did not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before daybreak he would awake , leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill , and reaching the forest , he would , under pretence of making studies in painting , test the hospitality of some peasants , procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet , casting off the lion s skin to assume that of the woodman; then , with his hands covered with dirt , his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb , his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe , he intended , by following the wooded districts , to reach the nearest frontier , walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries , and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once past the frontier , andrea proposed making money of his diamonds; and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank - notes he always carried about with him in case of accident , he would then find himself possessor of about 50 ,000 livres , which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters , but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long - pointed knife , whose temper he well knew , and which was never absent from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about seven in the morning andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight , which played , warm and brilliant , upon his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in all well - organized brains , the predominating ideaand there always is oneis sure to be the last thought before sleeping , and the first upon waking in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself , and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he jumped out of bed and ran to the window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a gendarme was crossing the court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world , even to a man void of uneasiness; but for one who has a timid conscience , and with good cause too , the yellow , blue , and white uniform is really very alarming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , all at once , he replied , with that logic which the reader has , doubtless , remarked in him ,  - there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn; instead of being astonished , let me dress myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now then , said andrea , while dressing himself ,  - i ll wait till he leaves , and then i ll slip away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not only was the first gendarme still there , but the young man now perceived a second yellow , blue , and white uniform at the foot of the staircase , the only one by which he could descend , while a third , on horseback , holding a musket in his fist , was posted as a sentinel at the great street - door which alone afforded the means of egress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they re after me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was andrea s first thought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - diable! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a pallor overspread the young man s forehead , and he looked around him with anxiety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney - piece; they were a pen , ink , and paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have no money to pay my bill , but i am not a dishonest man; i leave behind me as a pledge this pin , worth ten times the amount . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this precise time , the first gendarme andrea had noticed walked upstairs , preceded by the commissary of police , and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at daybreak , the telegraphs were set at work in all directions , and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the htel de ville , which is next door to the bell and bottle , it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sentinel who was relieved at six o clock in the morning , remembered perfectly that , just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four , a young man arrived on horseback , with a little boy before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man , having dismissed the boy and horse , knocked at the door of the hotel , which was opened , and again closed after his entrance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they found the door ajar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , oh , said the brigadier , who thoroughly understood the trick;  - a bad sign to find the door open! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , indeed , the little note and pin upon the table confirmed , or rather corroborated , the sad truth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea had fled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we say corroborated , because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he glanced around , looked in the bed , shook the curtains , opened the closets , and finally stopped at the chimney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fire crackled , and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano; but still no prisoner fell down , as they expected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fact was , that andrea , at war with society ever since his youth , was quite as deep as a gendarme , even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier , and quite prepared for the fire , he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney - pots . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at one time he thought he was saved , for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice , to the two gendarmes ,  - he is not here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but venturing to peep , he perceived that the latter , instead of retiring , as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement , were watching with increased attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was now his turn to look about him; the htel de ville , a massive sixteenth century building , was on his right; anyone could descend from the openings in the tower , and examine every corner of the roof below , and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if once discovered , he knew he would be lost , for the roof afforded no chance of escape; he therefore resolved to descend , not through the same chimney by which he had come up , but by a similar one conducting to another room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued , and having reached it , he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same minute , one of the little windows of the htel de ville was thrown open , and the head of a gendarme appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the brigadier , calm and dignified as the law he represented , passed through the crowd , without answering the thousand questions addressed to him , and re - entered the hotel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the two gendarmes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , my boys , said the brigadier ,  - the brigand must really have escaped early this morning; but we will send to the villers - coterets and noyon roads , and search the forest , when we shall catch him , no doubt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , what is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what number was it that rang? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - number 3 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - run , waiter! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the brigadier , stopping the servant ,  - the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter; we will attend upon him with a gendarme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who occupies number 3? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the little fellow who arrived last night in a post - chaise with his sister , and who asked for an apartment with two beds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - follow me , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> commissary! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the brigadier;  - tread in my steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait an instant , said the host;  - number 3 has two staircases ,inside and outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will take charge of the inside one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are the carbines loaded? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , brigadier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is what had happened: andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two - thirds of the chimney , but then his foot slipped , and notwithstanding his endeavors , he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would have signified little had the room been empty , but unfortunately it was occupied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two ladies , sleeping in one bed , were awakened by the noise , and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded , they saw a man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of these ladies , the fair one , uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house , while the other , rushing to the bell - rope , rang with all her strength . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea , as we can see , was surrounded by misfortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for pity s sake , he cried , pale and bewildered , without seeing whom he was addressing , - for pity s sake do not call assistance! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> save me! i will not harm you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - andrea , the murderer! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried one of the ladies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - eugnie! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mademoiselle danglars! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed andrea , stupefied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for pity , for mercy s sake do not deliver me up! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is too late , they are coming , said eugnie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , conceal me somewhere; you can say you were needlessly alarmed; you can turn their suspicions and save my life! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two ladies , pressing closely to one another , and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them , remained silent to this supplicating voice , repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , be it so , at length said eugnie;  - return by the same road you came , and we will say nothing about you , unhappy wretch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here he is , here he is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried a voice from the landing;  - here he is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i see him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock , two more forced out the bolts , and the broken door fell in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fly , then! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried mademoiselle d armilly , whose pity returned as her fears diminished;  - fly! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - or kill yourself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said eugnie ( in a tone which a vestal in the amphitheatre would have used , when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary ) . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea shuddered , and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - kill myself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bah , said cavalcanti , crossing his arms ,  - one has friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the brigadier advanced to him , sword in hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea turned towards them , and with an impertinent smile asked ,  - have you any message for your father , mademoiselle danglars , for in all probability i shall return to paris? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eugnie covered her face with her hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was i not nearly your husband? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an hour after they stepped into their calash , both dressed in feminine attire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight , but they were forced , when the door was open , to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eugnie closed her eyes; but though she could not see , she could hear , and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , why is not the world a wilderness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day they stopped at the htel de flandre , at brussels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly accomplished their transformation and flight; the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which , over a girl of eugnie s character , could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking; for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union , the mother , to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter , must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , madame danglars feared eugnie s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d armilly; she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray ,an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary; moreover , she saw that eugnie detested debray , not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof , but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men , and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unfortunately , in this world of ours , each person views things through a certain medium , and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others , and madame danglars , therefore , very much regretted that the marriage of eugnie had not taken place , not only because the match was good , and likely to insure the happiness of her child , but because it would also set her at liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she ran therefore to debray , who , after having , like the rest of paris , witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it , had retired in haste to his club , where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three - fourths of that city known as the capital of the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the precise time when madame danglars , dressed in black and concealed in a long veil , was ascending the stairs leading to debray s apartments , notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home , debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend , who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought , as a friend of the family , to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray did not defend himself very warmly , for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind; still , when he recollected the independent , proud spirit of eugnie , he positively rejected it as utterly impossible , though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting - place in his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tea , play , and the conversation , which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs , lasted till one o clock in the morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile madame danglars , veiled and uneasy , awaited the return of debray in the little green room , seated between two baskets of flowers , which she had that morning sent , and which , it must be confessed , debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at twenty minutes to twelve , madame danglars , tired of waiting , returned home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect , they seldom return home after twelve o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was fearful of exciting any remark , and believed firmly in her daughter s innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she listened at eugnie s door , and hearing no sound tried to enter , but the bolts were in place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening , and had gone to bed and to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she called the maid and questioned her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mademoiselle eugnie , said the maid ,  - retired to her apartment with mademoiselle d armilly; they then took tea together , after which they desired me to leave , saying that they needed me no longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since then the maid had been below , and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room; madame danglars , therefore , went to bed without a shadow of suspicion , and began to muse over the recent events . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in proportion as her memory became clearer , the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light; what she had taken for confusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as something distressing , was in reality a disgrace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercds , who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the affair , as it will be reported , will cover us with shame; for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how fortunate that eugnie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and her glance was turned towards heaven , where a mysterious providence disposes all things , and out of a fault , nay , even a vice , sometimes produces a blessing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this andrea was a wretch , a robber , an assassin , and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education , if not a complete one; he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune , supported by an honorable name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , to whom she had run , with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves , and who yet betrays her ,debray could but give her advice , she must apply to someone more powerful than he . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but , no; on reflection , the procureur was not a merciless man; and it was not the magistrate , slave to his duties , but the friend , the loyal friend , who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption; it was not the executioner , but the surgeon , who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son - in - law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and since villefort , the friend of danglars , had acted in this way , no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with , or had lent himself to , any of andrea s intrigues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort s conduct , therefore , upon reflection , appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there; she would see him the next day , and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate , she would , at least , obtain all the indulgence he could allow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she would invoke the past , recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty , yet happy days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort would stifle the affair; he had only to turn his eyes on one side , and allow andrea to fly , and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and after this reasoning she slept easily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort s house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some of the apartments were closed within and without; the shutters were only opened to admit a minute s air , showing the scared face of a footman , and immediately afterwards the window would be closed , like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre , and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice ,  - will there be another funeral today at the procureur s house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three times did the bell ring with a dull , heavy sound , seeming to participate , in the general sadness , before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door , which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - do you intend opening the door? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - first , madame , who are you? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes; go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the concierge closed the door , leaving madame danglars in the street . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the baroness ascended the steps; she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own , and still guided by the valet de chambre , who never lost sight of her for an instant , she was introduced to the magistrate s study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit , the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting , that she began by complaining of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - forgive my servants , he said ,  - for a terror i cannot blame them for; from being suspected they have become suspicious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded , but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you too , then , are unhappy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , madame , replied the magistrate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you pity me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you understand what brings me here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , madame , said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner ,  - i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - everything will be forgotten , madame , said villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars gazed on villefort , stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - am i come to a friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know that you are , madame , said villefort , whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort bowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances; that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this annoys you; let us change the subject . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i hope so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at least keep him there till my daughter be married . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - impossible , madame; justice has its formalities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the baroness , half jesting , half in earnest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for all , even for myself among the rest , replied villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the baroness , without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you could not help thinking of it , and saying to yourself , you , who pursue crime so vindictively , answer now , why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling?   the baroness became pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you were saying this , were you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i own it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will answer you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars; then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown , and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty; but when the culprits are discovered ( villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk ) - when they are discovered , i swear to you , by all i hold most sacred , that whoever they may be they shall die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , after the oath i have just taken , and which i will keep , madame , dare you ask for mercy for that wretch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , sir , are you sure he is as guilty as they say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  he promised well , as you seefirst a runaway , then an assassin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who is this wretch? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who can tell? a vagabond , a corsican . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - has no one owned him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but who was the man who brought him from lucca? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - another rascal like himself , perhaps his accomplice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the baroness clasped her hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for heaven s sake , madame , said villefort , with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshness - for heaven s sake , do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what am i? the law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has the law any eyes to witness your grief? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , madame; the law has commanded , and when it commands it strikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look at me , madamelook around me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has mankind treated me as a brother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have men loved me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have they spared me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , madame , they struck me , always struck me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - woman , siren that you are , do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye , which reminds me that i ought to blush? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every criminal i condemn seems to me living evidence that i am not a hideous exception to the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas , alas , alas; all the world is wicked; let us therefore strike at wickedness! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage , which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but  said madame danglars , resolving to make a last effort ,  - this young man , though a murderer , is an orphan , abandoned by everybody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so much the worse , or rather , so much the better; it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but this is trampling on the weak , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his dishonor reflects upon us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is not death in my house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said villefort , raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at least , delay the trial till the next assizes; we shall then have six months before us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , madame , said villefort;  - instructions have been given . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort seized the letter , and hastily broke the seal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he exclaimed;  - he was taken at compigne , and all is over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars rose from her seat , pale and cold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - adieu , sir , she said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - adieu , madame , replied the king s attorney , as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , turning to his desk , he said , striking the letter with the back of his right hand: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , i had a forgery , three robberies , and two cases of arson , i only wanted a murder , and here it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the procureur had told madame danglars , valentine was not yet recovered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bowed down with fatigue , she was indeed confined to her bed; and it was in her own room , and from the lips of madame de villefort , that she heard all the strange events we have related; we mean the flight of eugnie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti , or rather benedetto , together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , her brain was only the seat of vague ideas , and confused forms , mingled with strange fancies , alone presented themselves before her eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the daytime valentine s perceptions remained tolerably clear , owing to the constant presence of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at six o clock villefort retired to his study , at eight m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny himself arrived , bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl , and then m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier was carried away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a nurse of the doctor s choice succeeded them , and never left till about ten or eleven o clock , when valentine was asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she went downstairs she gave the keys of valentine s room to m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every morning morrel called on noirtier to receive news of valentine , and , extraordinary as it seemed , each day found him less uneasy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now four days had elapsed , and valentine still lived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep , or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours; it was then , in the silence of night , in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney - piece , that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness , and fan the fever with their trembling wings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her , then morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes mere strangers , like the count of monte cristo came to visit her; even the very furniture , in these moments of delirium , seemed to move , and this state lasted till about three o clock in the morning , when a deep , heavy slumber overcame the young girl , from which she did not awake till daylight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugnie and the arrest of benedetto ,villefort having retired as well as noirtier and d avrigny ,her thoughts wandered in a confused maze , alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the nurse , having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient , and locked the door , was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen , and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the house of the king s attorney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left; valentine , who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly , incapable of controlling her ideas , was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at any other time valentine would have seized the silken bell - pull and summoned assistance , but nothing astonished her in her present situation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination , and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms , who disappeared with the coming of daylight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , she felt her pulse , and finding it throb violently she remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink , for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain , and for a short time she suffered less . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass , but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her , and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath , and felt the pressure of his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time the illusion , or rather the reality , surpassed anything valentine had before experienced; she began to believe herself really alive and awake , and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision; but the man , instead of dissolving like a shadow , again approached her , and said in an agitated voice ,  - now you may drink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine shuddered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice , and she was about to utter an exclamation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count of monte cristo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl s mind as to the reality of the scene; her eyes started with terror , her hands trembled , and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , the presence of monte cristo at such an hour , his mysterious , fanciful , and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall , might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not call anyonedo not be alarmed , said the count;  - do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast; the man standing before you , valentine ( for this time it is no ghost ) , is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl s mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen to me , he said ,  - or , rather , look upon me; look at my face , paler even than usual , and my eyes , red with wearinessfor four days i have not closed them , for i have been constantly watching you , to protect and preserve you for maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of valentine , for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he told me your life was his , and i have promised him that you shall live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have promised him that i shall live? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , sir , you spoke of vigilance and protection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you a doctor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you say you have watched? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said valentine uneasily;  - where have you been? i have not seen you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count extended his hand towards the library . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine turned her eyes away , and , with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear , exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion , and that what you call protection is more like an insult . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - valentine , he answered ,  - during my long watch over you , all i have observed has been what people visited you , what nourishment was prepared , and what beverage was served; then , when the latter appeared dangerous to me , i entered , as i have now done , and substituted , in the place of the poison , a healthful draught; which , instead of producing the death intended , caused life to circulate in your veins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poisondeath! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush , my child , said monte cristo , again placing his finger upon her lips ,  - i did say poison and death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but drink some of this; and the count took a bottle from his pocket , containing a red liquid , of which he poured a few drops into the glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine stretched out her hand , but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo took the glass , drank half its contents , and then presented it to valentine , who smiled and swallowed the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , she exclaimed ,  - i recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much , and seemed to ease my aching brain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thank you , sir , thank you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is how you have lived during the last four nights , valentine , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said valentine , at the height of her terror ,  - you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass; but if you saw this , you must also have seen the person who poured it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine raised herself in bed , and drew over her chest , which appeared whiter than snow , the embroidered cambric , still moist with the cold dews of delirium , to which were now added those of terror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated the young girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , repeated the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what you tell me is horrible , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what? attempt to murder me in my father s house , in my room , on my bed of sickness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you the first that this hand has stricken? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you not seen m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> would not m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier also have fallen a victim , had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , heaven , said valentine;  - is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor , like that of dried orange - peel? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your grandfather knows , then , that a poisoner lives here; perhaps he even suspects the person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has been fortifying you , his beloved child , against the fatal effects of the poison , which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago , which is generally but too fatal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me also ask you a question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you never seen anyone enter your room at night? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes; i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me , approach , and disappear; but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination , and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you do not know who it is that attempts your life? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said valentine , looking anxiously around . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because you are not feverish or delirious tonight , but thoroughly awake; midnight is striking , which is the hour murderers choose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , heavens , exclaimed valentine , wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> midnight struck slowly and sadly; every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine seized the count s hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think i hear a noise , she said;  - leave me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - bye , for the present , replied the count , walking upon tiptoe towards the library door , and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girl s heart was filled with gratitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before closing the door he turned around once more , and said ,  - not a movementnot a word; let them think you asleep , or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine was alone; two other clocks , slower than that of saint - philippe - du - roule , struck the hour of midnight from different directions , and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she began counting them , remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart; and still she doubted ,the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why should they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one terrible idea pressed upon her mind ,that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her , and who was about to endeavor to do so again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> supposing this person , wearied at the inefficacy of the poison , should , as monte cristo intimated , have recourse to steel! what if the count should have no time to run to her rescue! what if her last moments were approaching , and she should never again see morrel! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when this terrible chain of ideas presented itself , valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell , and call for help . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the countthat eye which lived in her memory , and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twenty minutes , twenty tedious minutes , passed thus , then ten more , and at last the clock struck the half - hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine had raised herself upon her elbow , and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm; then , trembling , agitated , and her heart beating with indescribable terror , she awaited the event . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said a low voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still silent: valentine had promised not to wake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then everything was still , excepting that valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she ventured to open her eyelids , and glance over her extended arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on recognizing her step - mother , valentine could not repress a shudder , which caused a vibration in the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall , and there , shaded by the bed - curtains , she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo; she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort , however , reassured by the silence , which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine , again extended her hand , and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she retired so gently that valentine did not know she had left the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she raised her head with an effort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the noiseless door again turned on its hinges , and the count of monte cristo reappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you seen? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you recognize? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - would you rather die , then , and cause maximilian s death? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - valentine , the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere; your servants will be seduced with gold , and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will find it in the water you drink from the spring , in the fruit you pluck from the tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , but not against a strong dose; the poison will be changed , and the quantity increased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took the glass and raised it to his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is already done , he said;  - brucine is no longer employed , but a simple narcotic! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you had taken what madame de villefort has poured into your glass , valentinevalentineyou would have been doomed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , exclaimed the young girl ,  - why am i thus pursued? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i have never injured her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you are rich , valentine; you have 200 ,000 livres a year , and you prevent her son from enjoying these 200 ,000 livres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how so? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - sir , said valentine ,  - i will do all i can to live , for there are two beings who love me and will die if i diemy grandfather and maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will watch over them as i have over you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , sir , do as you will with me; and then she added , in a low voice ,  - oh , heavens , what will befall me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> reassure yourself , then , and say to yourself: at this moment , a friend , a father , who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian , watches over me!  <s> <s>  - alas , alas , what a fearful extremity! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you are my own darling child , valentine! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands ,for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage ,and began to pray , and while uttering little more than incoherent words , she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair , and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl s arm , drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat , and said with a paternal smile: </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - and now , my dear child , adieu for the present . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go , said valentine ,  - whatever happens , i promise you not to fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he took the glass , emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace , that it might be supposed valentine had taken it , and replaced it on the table; then he disappeared , after throwing a farewell glance on valentine , who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the lord . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the night - light continued to burn on the chimney - piece , exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue , and the flame , brightening before it expired , threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was then that the door of edward s room opened , and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite; it was madame de villefort , who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she stopped in the doorway , listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp , the only sound in that deserted room , and then advanced to the table to see if valentine s glass were empty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was still about a quarter full , as we before stated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dim light , the profound silence , and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour , and still more by her own conscience , all combined to produce a sensation of fear; the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young girl no longer breathed , no breath issued through the half - closed teeth; the white lips no longer quiveredthe eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor , and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness; then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl s heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort had no longer any doubt; all was overshe had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no more to do in the room , so the poisoner retired stealthily , as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps; but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain , absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death , so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the minutes passed; madame de villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> immediately afterwards the light expired , and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity , while the clock at that minute struck half - past four . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> overpowered with agitation , the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door , and reached her room in an agony of fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the darkness lasted two hours longer; then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds , until at length it revealed the objects in the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about this time the nurse s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire , and although she had just left her bed , she could not resist the temptation offered by valentine s sleep , so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the clock striking eight awoke her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she tried to replace the arm , but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick - nurse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she screamed aloud; then running to the door exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny , at the foot of the stairs , it being the hour he usually visited her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - doctor , do you hear them call for help? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but before the doctor and the father could reach the room , the servants who were on the same floor had entered , and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed , they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed , as though struck by lightening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the procureur from the door of his chamber , which apparently he scarcely dared to leave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny , who ran to valentine , and raised her in his arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? this one , too? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , where will be the end? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he exclaimed , raising his hands to heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i say that valentine is dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied d avrigny , in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father , the servants all fled with muttered imprecations; they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages , then there was a rush in the court , afterwards all was still; they had , one and all , deserted the accursed house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she saw d avrigny curiously examining the glass , which she felt certain of having emptied during the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was now a third full , just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the spectre of valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was , indeed , the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass , and which valentine had drunk; it was indeed the poison , which could not deceive m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny , which he now examined so closely; it was doubtless a miracle from heaven , that , notwithstanding her precautions , there should be some trace , some proof remaining to reveal the crime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , exclaimed d avrigny , in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort was overpowered; her eyes first flashed and then swam , she staggered towards the door and disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go to the assistance of madame de villefort , he said to the nurse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame de villefort is ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but mademoiselle de villefort stammered the nurse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mademoiselle de villefort no longer requires help , said d avrigny ,  - since she is dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dead ,dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two men turned round , and saw morrel standing at the door , pale and terror - stricken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is what had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> contrary to custom , the door was open , and having no occasion to ring he entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier; but no one answered , the servants having , as we know , deserted the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every night the count had given him news , which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he determined to go up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s room was opened , like all the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place , but his eyes expressed alarm , which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how are you , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , answered the old man , by closing his eyes; but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are thoughtful , sir , continued morrel;  - you want something; shall i call one of the servants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel pulled the bell , but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned towards noirtier; the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is anyone ill in the house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eyes of noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , signed noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continued the old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian rushed up the little staircase , while noirtier s eyes seemed to say , - quicker , quicker! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a minute the young man darted through several rooms , till at length he reached valentine s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no occasion to push the door , it was wide open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a sob was the only sound he heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw as though in a mist , a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was then he heard a voice exclaim  - valentine is dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dead ,dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort rose , half - ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the terrible office he had held for twenty - five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his glance , at first wandering , fixed itself upon morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who are you , sir , he asked ,  - that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> go , sir , go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but morrel remained motionless; he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed , and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go! do you hear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said villefort , while d avrigny advanced to lead morrel out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse , gazed all around the room , then upon the two men; he opened his mouth to speak , but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain , he went out , thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and d avrigny , for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic , exchanged glances , which seemed to say , - he is mad! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed , his face expressing all his meaning , and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each time he had been brought into contact with his father , something terrible had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried morrel , with one hand leaning on the back of the chair , and the other extended towards valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man , who , almost a stranger to him , called noirtier his father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot; the veins of the throat swelled; his cheeks and temples became purple , as though he was struck with epilepsy; nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , cried morrel , seizing the moist hand of the paralytic ,  - they ask me who i am , and what right i have to be here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , you know it , tell them , tell them! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , happier than the young man , who sobbed without weeping , tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell them she was my beloved , my noble girl , my only blessing in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish , fell heavily on his knees before the bed , which his fingers grasped with convulsive energy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny , unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion , turned away; and villefort , without seeking any further explanation , and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn , extended his hand towards the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs , exclamations , and prayers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length villefort , the most composed of all , spoke: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i knew nothing of this engagement , of this love , yet i , her father , forgive you , for i see that your grief is real and deep; and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earthshe has nothing more to do with the adoration of men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take a last farewell , sir , of her sad remains; take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own , and then separate yourself from her forever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eyes of noirtier glistened , and d avrigny approached . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentlemen , said morrel , reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene ,  - i know what i am saying , and you know as well as i do what i am about to sayvalentine has been assassinated! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> le procureur du roi , said morrel with increasing vehemence ,  - no mercy is allowed; i denounce the crime; it is your place to seek the assassin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man s implacable eyes interrogated villefort , who , on his side , glanced from noirtier to d avrigny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father , he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - assuredly , said d avrigny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , said villefort , striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotion , - sir , you are deceived; no one commits crimes here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am stricken by fate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is horrible , indeed , but no one assassinates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , however , extended his arm , and commanded silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i say that murders are committed here , said morrel , whose voice , though lower in tone , lost none of its terrible distinctness:  - i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i tell you , valentine s life was attempted by poison four days ago , though she escaped , owing to the precautions of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i tell you that the dose has been double , the poison changed , and that this time it has succeeded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i tell you that you know these things as well as i do , since this gentleman has forewarned you , both as a doctor and as a friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you rave , sir , exclaimed villefort , in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you thought yourselves alone , and talked about that tragical death , and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , continued morrel;  - recall the scene , for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort towards his own relations , i ought to have denounced him to the authorities; then i should not have been an accomplice to thy death , as i now am , sweet , beloved valentine; but the accomplice shall become the avenger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this fourth murder is apparent to all , and if thy father abandon thee , valentine , it is i , and i swear it , that shall pursue the assassin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and this time , as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame , nearly bursting with its own strength , the words of morrel were stifled in his throat; his breast heaved; the tears , so long rebellious , gushed from his eyes; and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then d avrigny spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , merciful heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel raised his head , and reading the eyes of the old man , which gleamed with unnatural lustre ,<s> <s>  - stay , he said ,  - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier wishes to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , indicated noirtier , with an expression the more terrible , from all his faculties being centred in his glance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know the assassin? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and will you direct us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny , listen! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own , he glanced towards the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you wish me to leave? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morrel , sadly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may i , at least , return? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - must i leave alone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whom am i to take with me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the doctor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you wish to remain alone with m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but can he understand you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said villefort , inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him alone , - oh , be satisfied , i can understand my father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while uttering these words with this expression of joy , his teeth clashed together violently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny took the young man s arm , and led him out of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard , and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where d avrigny and morrel had been staying , one absorbed in meditation , the other in grief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel looked attentively on villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two men drew back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i entreat you continued villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said morrel ,  - the culpritthe murdererthe assassin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my father has revealed the culprit s name; my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do , yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , resolutely replied noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it not so , father? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort continued: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he knows me , and i have pledged my word to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rest assured , gentlemen , that within three days , in a less time than justice would demand , the revenge i shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble; and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth , and grasped the old man s senseless hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will this promise be fulfilled , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel , while d avrigny looked inquiringly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have before stated that all the servants had fled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort was therefore obliged to request m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city , more especially a death under such suspicious circumstances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was something terrible to witness the silent agony , the mute despair of noirtier , whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort retired to his study , and d avrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty , whose office it is to examine bodies after decease , and who is expressly named  - the doctor of the dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of a quarter of an hour m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer gate closed , and not a servant remaining in the house; villefort himself was obliged to open to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he stopped on the landing; he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier was near the bed , pale , motionless , and silent as the corpse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , said d avrigny ,  - she is indeed dead , poor child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , answered the doctor laconically , dropping the sheet he had raised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he therefore approached the bed , and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime , he uncovered the calm and pale face , which looked like that of a sleeping angel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a tear , which appeared in the old man s eye , expressed his thanks to the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table , and having fulfilled his duty , was conducted out by d avrigny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort met them at the door of his study; having in a few words thanked the district doctor , he turned to d avrigny , and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now the priest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked d avrigny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall i call on him as i pass? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - d avrigny , said villefort ,  - be so kind , i beseech you , as to accompany this gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here is the key of the door , so that you can go in and out as you please; you will bring the priest with you , and will oblige me by introducing him into my child s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you wish to see him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i only wish to be alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will excuse me , will you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the doctors entered the street , they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is the abb of whom i spoke , said the doctor to d avrigny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny accosted the priest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , he said ,  - are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i mean m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , the king s attorney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said the priest , in a marked italian accent;  - yes , i have heard that death is in that house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a young girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know it , sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i also know that her name is valentine , and i have already prayed for her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , sir , said d avrigny;  - since you have commenced your sacred office , deign to continue it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come and watch by the dead , and all the wretched family will be grateful to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am going , sir; and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on entering the room , noirtier s eyes met those of the abb , and no doubt he read some particular expression in them , for he remained in the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead , and the abb promised to devote his prayers to valentine and his attentions to noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in order , doubtless , that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission , the priest rose as soon as d avrigny departed , and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left , but also that leading to madame de villefort s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning dawned dull and cloudy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this winding - sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric , which the young girl had bought a fortnight before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the evening two men , engaged for the purpose , had carried noirtier from valentine s room into his own , and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the abb busoni had watched till daylight , and then left without calling anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d avrigny returned about eight o clock in the morning; he met villefort on his way to noirtier s room , and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they both stood in amazement at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - see , said d avrigny to villefort ,  - nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one can say that m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier did not love his child , and yet he sleeps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , you are right , replied villefort , surprised;  - he sleeps , indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - grief has stunned him , replied d avrigny; and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur s study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have not been in bed for two nights; but then look at my desk; see what i have written during these two days and nights . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have filled those papers , and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you require my services now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked d avrigny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the procureur again becoming a man , lifted up his eyes and groaned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall you be present in the reception - room? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall work , doctorwhen i work i forget everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , indeed , no sooner had the doctor left the room , than he was again absorbed in work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the doorsteps d avrigny met the cousin whom villefort had mentioned , a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupiedone of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was punctual , dressed in black , with crape around his hat , and presented himself at his cousin s with a face made up for the occasion , and which he could alter as might be required . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at eleven o clock the mourning - coaches rolled into the paved court , and the rue du faubourg saint - honor was filled with a crowd of idlers , equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich , and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort moved in the first parisian circles , less owing to his social position than to his personal merit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests , and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves , and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears , as would have been the case with a father , a brother , or a lover . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - well , said he , extending his hand to monte cristo ,  - i suppose you have come to sympathize with me , for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  well , on my word of honor , i answered , no!   i wished no ill to morcerf; he was a little proud , perhaps , for a man who like myself has risen from nothing; but we all have our faults . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you know , count , that persons of our time of lifenot that you belong to the class , you are still a young man ,but as i was saying , persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for example , look at the puritanical procureur , who has just lost his daughter , and in fact nearly all his family , in so singular a manner; morcerf dishonored and dead; and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto; besides<s> <s>  - besides what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , do you not know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what new calamity? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my daughter<s> <s>  - mademoiselle danglars? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - good heavens , what are you telling me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , how happy you must be in not having either wife or children! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and so mademoiselle danglars<s> <s>  - she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch , so she asked permission to travel . </s> </s>

<s> <s> danglars smiled at the good - natured pleasantry of the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that reminds me , he said ,  - that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds; i have already signed two: will you allow me to do the same to the others? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pray do so . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - oh , well , then , said monte cristo ,  - i am not particular about these five notes , pay me in a different form; i wished , from curiosity , to take these , that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five millions without a minute s delay; it would have been remarkable . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - pardon me , count , pardon me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said danglars , while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say ,  - come , reflect; if you repent there is still time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said danglars ,  - no , decidedly no; keep my signatures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how absurdas if one crown were not as good as another . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - count , said danglars ,  - are you speaking seriously? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never joke with bankers , said monte cristo in a freezing manner , which repelled impertinence; and he turned to the door , just as the valet de chambre announced: </s> </s>

<s> <s> my funds are deposited there , and you can understand that if i draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said boville , with a tone of entire incredulity ,  - five millions to that gentleman who just left , and who bowed to me as though he knew me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps he knows you , though you do not know him; m . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - five millions! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here is his receipt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> believe your own eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - do you know the house of thomson & french? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is one of the best houses in europe , said danglars , carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk . </s> </s>

<s> <s> why , this count of monte cristo must be a nabob? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - oh , you may make sure of him; his charities alone amount to 20 ,000 francs a month . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is magnificent! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will set before him the example of madame de morcerf and her son . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - how do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the receipt of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de monte cristo is as good as money; take it to rothschild s or lafitte s , and they will take it off your hands at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly; it will only cost you a discount of 5 ,000 or 6 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the receiver started back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said ,  - i prefer waiting till tomorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a proposition! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thought , perhaps , said danglars with supreme impertinence ,  - that you had a deficiency to make up? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , said the receiver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , no , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but without fail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , you are laughing at me; send tomorrow at twelve , and the bank shall be notified . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the way , said m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said the banker;  - i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto , so i remain in the background . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bah , you are wrong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how were you to blame in that affair? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listenwhen one bears an irreproachable name , as i do , one is rather sensitive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - everybody pities you , sir; and , above all , mademoiselle danglars! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor eugnie! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars;  - do you know she is going to embrace a religious life? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , it is unhappily but too true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , it is terrible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville retired with this exclamation , after expressing acute sympathy with the father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he had scarcely left before danglars , with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen robert macaire represented by frdrick ,[24] exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fool! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then enclosing monte cristo s receipt in a little pocket - book , he added: - yes , come at twelve o clock; i shall then be far away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to madame la baronne danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will place it on her table myself tonight , he murmured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then taking a passport from his drawer he said , - good , it is available for two months longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking valentine to her last home on earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , a true parisian , considered the cemetery of pre - lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian family; there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had therefore purchased a vault , which was quickly occupied by members of his family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards pre - lachaise from the faubourg saint - honor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having crossed paris , it passed through the faubourg du temple , then leaving the exterior boulevards , it reached the cemetery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> more than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourning - coaches , and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these last consisted of all the young people whom valentine s death had struck like a thunderbolt , and who , notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season , could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful , chaste , and adorable girl , thus cut off in the flower of her youth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they left paris , an equipage with four horses , at full speed , was seen to draw up suddenly; it contained monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> chteau - renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coup , joined him; beauchamp did the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd; he was evidently watching for someone , but his search ended in disappointment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked;  - do either of these gentlemen know where he is? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we have already asked that question , said chteau - renaud ,  - for none of us has seen him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count was silent , but continued to gaze around him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues; the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments; then follows the melancholy chant of the priests , mingled now and then with a sob of anguish , escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow , which no one else observed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the procession stopped , this shadow was recognized as morrel , who , with his coat buttoned up to his throat , his face livid , and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers , leaned against a tree , situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum , so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything was conducted in the usual manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few men , the least impressed of all by the scene , pronounced a discourse , some deploring this premature death , others expatiating on the grief of the father , and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to falluntil at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches , elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du prier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo heard and saw nothing , or rather he only saw morrel , whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - see , said beauchamp , pointing out morrel to debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is he doing up there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is cold , said debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not at all , said chteau - renaud , slowly;  - i think he is violently agitated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is very susceptible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you recollect that ball , count , where you produced such an effect? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel , who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man knelt down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count , with outstretched neck and glaring eyes , stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon morrel upon the first occasion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel bent his head till it touched the stone , then clutching the grating with both hands , he murmured: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , valentine! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words; he stepped forward , and touching the young man s shoulder , said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was looking for you , my friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo expected a burst of passion , but he was deceived , for morrel turning round , said calmly ,<s> <s>  - you see i was praying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then seemed more easy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall i drive you back to paris? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you wish anything? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - leave me to pray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count withdrew without opposition , but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of morrel , who at length arose , brushed the dust from his knees , and turned towards paris , without once looking back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> five minutes after the door had been closed on morrel s entrance , it was again opened for the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , count , she exclaimed , with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the rue meslay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - maximilian has just returned , has he not , madame? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i think i saw him pass; but pray , call emmanuel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go , then , she said with a charming smile , which accompanied him until he had disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilian s room; when he reached the landing he listened attentively , but all was still . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like many old houses occupied by a single family , the room door was panelled with glass; but it was locked , maximilian was shut in , and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room , because a red curtain was drawn before the glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what shall i do! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he uttered , and reflected for a moment;  - shall i ring? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , the sound of a bell , announcing a visitor , will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilian s situation , and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning , he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow; the glass was shivered to atoms , then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel , who had been writing at his desk , bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i beg a thousand pardons , said the count ,  - there is nothing the matter , but i slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since it is opened , i will take advantage of it to enter your room; do not disturb yourselfdo not disturb yourself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and passing his hand through the broken glass , the count opened the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi , said monte cristo , rubbing his elbow ,  - it s all your servant s fault; your stairs are so polished , it is like walking on glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you hurt , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> coldly asked morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i believe not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you were writing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , true , i was writing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do sometimes , soldier though i am . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you were writing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo with a searching look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have already had the honor of telling you i was , said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count looked around him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your pistols are beside your desk , said monte cristo , pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am on the point of starting on a journey , replied morrel disdainfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friend , exclaimed monte cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morrel , shrugging his shoulders;  - is there anything extraordinary in a journey? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - maximilian , said the count ,  - let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can understand , can you not , that to have acted as i have done , to have broken that glass , to have intruded on the solitude of a friendyou can understand that , to have done all this , i must have been actuated by real uneasiness , or rather by a terrible conviction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , you are going to destroy yourself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , count , said morrel , shuddering;  - what has put this into your head? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel rushed forward to tear it from him , but monte cristo perceiving his intention , seized his wrist with his iron grasp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you wish to destroy yourself , said the count;  - you have written it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when , sir , i tell you all this with tears of heartfelt anguish , can you reply that i am wrong , can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable existence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me , sir , could you have the courage to do so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed morrel , with increasing anger and reproach - you , who have deceived me with false hopes , who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises , when i might , if not have saved her , at least have seen her die in my arms! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you , who pretend to understand everything , even the hidden sources of knowledge ,and who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth , and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when you spoke to me at the cemetery , i answered youmy heart was softened; when you arrived here , i allowed you to enter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but since you abuse my confidence , since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all , then , count of monte cristo my pretended benefactorthen , count of monte cristo , the universal guardian , be satisfied , you shall witness the death of your friend; and morrel , with a maniacal laugh , again rushed towards the pistols . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i again repeat , you shall not commit suicide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who are you , then , that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who am i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why do you mention my father? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stammered he;  - why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel made another step back , staggering , breathless , crushed; then all his strength give way , and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo endeavored also to leave , but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door , which he closed upon the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> julie threw herself into the arms of the count; emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel; morrel again fell on his knees , and struck the ground with his forehead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the iron - hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast; a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes , he bent his head and wept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs , while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room , descended to the next floor , ran into the drawing - room with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the alles de meilhan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile , emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , my friends , said the count - i may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven yearsthe discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom , but your brother maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now , i am sure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then turning around , and seeing that morrel , still on his knees , had thrown himself into an armchair , he added in a low voice , pressing emmanuel s hand significantly ,  - watch over him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the young man , surprised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i cannot explain myself; but watch over him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols; his eyes rested on the weapons , and he pointed to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> emmanuel went towards the pistols . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - leave them , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here is the relic , she said;  - do not think it will be less dear to us now we are acquainted with our benefactor! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , said julie , pressing the purse to her heart ,  - no , no , i beseech you do not take it , for some unhappy day you will leave us , will you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have guessed rightly , madame , replied monte cristo , smiling;  - in a week i shall have left this country , where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily , while my father perished of hunger and grief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while announcing his departure , the count fixed his eyes on morrel , and remarked that the words ,  - i shall have left this country , had failed to rouse him from his lethargy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my kind friends , leave me alone with maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic , which monte cristo had forgotten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she drew her husband to the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us leave them , she said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count was alone with morrel , who remained motionless as a statue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said monte - cristo , touching his shoulder with his finger ,  - are you a man again , maximilian? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , do not fear , my friend , said morrel , raising his head , and smiling with a sweet expression on the count;  - i shall no longer attempt my life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then we are to have no more pistolsno more despair? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor fellow , what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my grief will kill me of itself . </s> </s>

<s> <s> said morrel ,  - what has become of her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she departed last night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to leave you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs - lyses , and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my departure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian hung his head , and obeyed with childlike reverence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> contrary to custom , this gentleman had not been watched , for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank , and one who would allow no impertinent interference , his incognito was strictly respected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his visits were tolerably regular , though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time , but generally , both in summer and winter , he took possession of his apartment about four o clock , though he never spent the night there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at half - past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant , who had the superintendence of the little apartment , and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at four o clock , as we have already stated , the mysterious personage arrived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house , a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress , and always thickly veiled; she passed like a shadow through the lodge , and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her face , therefore , like that of the gentleman , was perfectly unknown to the two concierges , who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door , which after being opened to admit her was again fastened , and curiosity penetrated no farther . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lady always left first , and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage , it drove away , sometimes towards the right hand , sometimes to the left; then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave , buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day after monte cristo had called upon danglars , the mysterious lodger entered at ten o clock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> almost directly afterwards , without the usual interval of time , a cab arrived , and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door opened , but before it could be closed , the lady exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , lucienoh , my friend! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger s name was lucien; still , as he was the very perfection of a door - keeper , he made up his mind not to tell his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , what is the matter , my dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , lucien , can i confide in you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course , you know you can do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what can be the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the lady , glancing inquiringly at lucien , - m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - left? m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars left? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where has he gone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not know . </s> </s>

<s> <s> has he gone intending not to return? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then what did you mean<s> <s>  - stayhe left a letter for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a letter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; read it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray paused a moment before reading , as if trying to guess its contents , or perhaps while making up his mind how to act , whatever it might contain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes , for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness , and which ran as follows: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray continued: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , you need not be alarmed , you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter; i mean that i shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i owe you some explanations for my conduct , and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me , i will give them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> listen , then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i received this morning five millions which i paid away; almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me; i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today , to escape that tomorrow , which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you understand this , do you not , my most precious wife? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say you understand this , because you are as conversant with my affairs as i am; indeed , i think you understand them better , since i am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my fortune , once very tolerable , while i am sure , madame , that you know perfectly well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i confess i have seen nothing but the fire; let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter , i philosophically closed my eyes; but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin i will not be the foundation of another man s fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> excuse me for speaking so very candidly , but as this is intended only for ourselves , i do not see why i should weigh my words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have augmented our fortune , and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years , till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it ,without any fault of mine , i can honestly declare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you , madame , have only sought to increase your own , and i am convinced that you have succeeded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i leave you , therefore , as i took you ,rich , but little respected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me , and which i intend following . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had ended the perusal , he folded the letter and resumed his pensive attitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unhesitatingly repeated debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with what ideas does that letter inspire you? </s> </s>

<s> <s> gone , never to return! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i tell you he will never return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he could have made any use of me , he would have taken me with him; he leaves me in paris , as our separation will conduce to his benefit;therefore he has gone , and i am free forever , added madame danglars , in the same supplicating tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she said at length ,  - do you not answer me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , then , you wish to ask advice of me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; i do wish to ask your advice , said madame danglars with anxious expectation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she murmured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly; as m . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then you can quit your house , leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure , and everyone s mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this , was equalled by the calm indifference with which debray had spoken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - deserted? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she repeated;  - ah , yes , i am , indeed , deserted! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are right , sir , and no one can doubt my position . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart , and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame , said debray ,  - it is nearly six months since we have been associated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our partnership began in the month of april . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in may we commenced operations , and in the course of the month gained 450 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in july we added 1 ,700 ,000 francs ,it was , you know , the month of the spanish bonds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , madame , said debray , delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker ,  - there are still 80 ,000 francs , the interest of this money , in my hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , said the baroness ,  - i thought you never put the money out to interest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are , then , 40 ,000 francs for your share , besides the 100 ,000 you furnished me to begin with , making in all 1 ,340 ,000 francs for your portion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , madame , i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday; it is not long ago , you see , and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say there , for as i did not consider my house safe enough , or lawyers sufficiently discreet , and as landed property carries evidence with it , and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband , i have kept this sum , now your whole fortune , in a chest concealed under that closet , and for greater security i myself concealed it there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , madame , continued debray , first opening the closet , then the chest; - now , madame , here are 800 notes of 1 ,000 francs each , resembling , as you see , a large book bound in iron; to this i add a certificate in the funds of 25 ,000 francs; then , for the odd cash , making i think about 110 ,000 francs , here is a check upon my banker , who , not being m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , will pay you the amount , you may rest assured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars mechanically took the check , the bond , and the heap of bank - notes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars , with tearless eyes , but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion , placed the bank - notes in her bag , put the certificate and check into her pocket - book , and then , standing pale and mute , awaited one kind word of consolation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but she waited in vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , madame , said debray ,  - you have a splendid fortune , an income of about 60 ,000 livres a year , which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year , at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will be able to indulge all your fancies; besides , should you find your income insufficient , you can , for the sake of the past , madame , make use of mine; and i am ready to offer you all i possess , on loan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , sirthank you , replied the baroness;  - you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires , who intends for some time , at least , to retire from the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray was , for a moment , surprised , but immediately recovering himself , he bowed with an air which seemed to say ,  - as you please , madame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame danglars had until then , perhaps , hoped for something; but when she saw the careless bow of debray , and the glance by which it was accompanied , together with his significant silence , she raised her head , and without passion or violence or even hesitation , ran downstairs , disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bah , said debray , when she had left ,  - these are fine projects! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she will remain at home , read novels , and speculate at cards , since she can no longer do so on the bourse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then taking up his account book , he cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had just paid away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have 1 ,060 ,000 francs remaining , he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a pity mademoiselle de villefort is dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she suited me in every respect , and i would have married her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during this time he occupied himself in making figures , with his watch by his side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another , inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds was much changed within the last few days; not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire; nor indeed , had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery; no , the change in mercds was that her eye no longer sparkled , her lips no longer smiled , and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not poverty which had broken her spirit; it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile , because she saw nothing but misery around her; the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt; the floor was uncarpeted; the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury; indeed , everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house; the continual silence of the spot oppressed her; still , seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings , she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone , which , contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes , seemed like  - moonlight on a statue ,yielding light without warmth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert , too , was ill at ease; the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mother , we have no more money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds had never known misery; she had often , in her youth , spoken of poverty , but between want and necessity , those synonymous words , there is a wide difference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> amongst the catalans , mercds wished for a thousand things , but still she never really wanted any . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so long as the nets were good , they caught fish; and so long as they sold their fish , they were able to buy twine for new nets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could; now there were two to be supported , and nothing to live upon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> winter approached . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> excitement , like enthusiasm , sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the excitement had calmed down , and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality; after having exhausted the ideal , they found they must talk of the actual . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mother , exclaimed albert , just as madame danglars was descending the stairs ,  - let us reckon our riches , if you please; i want capital to build my plans upon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - capitalnothing! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied mercds with a mournful smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , mother ,capital 3 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sighed mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , dear mother , said the young man ,  - i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these 3 ,000 francs are enormous , and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you say this , my dear boy; but do you think we ought to accept these 3 ,000 francs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mercds , coloring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think so , answered albert in a firm tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with 200 francs? are you sure , albert? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will take your place in the coup to chlons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you see , mother , i treat you handsomely for thirty - five francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert then took a pen , and wrote: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us put down 120 , added albert , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see i am generous , am i not , mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you , my poor child? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a young man does not require luxuries; besides , i know what travelling is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with a post - chaise and valet de chambre? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - any way , mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here they are , and 200 more besides . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see , i have sold my watch for 100 francs , and the guard and seals for 300 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still the same story of superfluities! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now i think we are rich , since instead of the 114 francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but we owe something in this house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thirty francs; but i pay that out of my 150 francs ,that is understood ,and as i require only eighty francs for my journey , you see i am overwhelmed with luxury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but that is not all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and albert took out of a little pocket - book with golden clasps , a remnant of his old fancies , or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door ,albert took out of this pocket - book a note of 1 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a thousand francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and albert , rising , kissed his mother on both cheeks , then stood looking at her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you cannot imagine , mother , how beautiful i think you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dear child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mercds , endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , just so , said albert;  - here begins the trial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have we come to any? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; it is decided that you are to live at marseilles , and that i am to leave for africa , where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear , instead of the one i have thrown aside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds sighed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , mother , i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis ,[25] added the young man , lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame , for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self - abasement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thought my body was my own , and that i might sell it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth , he added , attempting to smile;  - i fetched 2 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then these 1 ,000 francs said mercds , shuddering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are the half of the sum , mother; the other will be paid in a year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mercds raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe , and tears , which had hitherto been restrained , now yielded to her emotion , and ran down her cheeks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the price of his blood! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , you will live! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mother , i must go , said albert in a firm , calm voice;  - you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you; besides , i have signed . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of madame de morcerf: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pardon me , he added with a smile ,  - i leave you , albert . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> albert understood his thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mother , he said , turning towards mercds ,  - this is m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , secretary of the minister for the interior , once a friend of mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stammered debray;  - what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i say so , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray , because i have no friends now , and i ought not to have any . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> debray stepped forward , and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - believe me , dear albert , he said , with all the emotion he was capable of feeling , - believe me , i feel deeply for your misfortunes , and if in any way i can serve you , i am yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank you , sir , said albert , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the midst of our misfortunes , we are still rich enough not to require assistance from anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the blood mounted to the temples of debray , who held a million in his pocket - book , and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house had contained two women , one of whom , justly dishonored , had left it poor with 1 ,500 ,000 francs under her cloak , while the other , unjustly stricken , but sublime in her misfortune , was yet rich with a few deniers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this parallel disturbed his usual politeness , the philosophy he witnessed appalled him , he muttered a few words of general civility and ran downstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that day the minister s clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his ill - humor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but that same night , he found himself the possessor of a fine house , situated on the boulevard de la madeleine , and an income of 50 ,000 livres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day , just as debray was signing the deed , that is about five o clock in the afternoon , madame de morcerf , after having affectionately embraced her son , entered the coup of the diligence , which closed upon her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man was hidden in lafitte s banking - house , behind one of the little arched windows which are placed above each desk; he saw mercds enter the diligence , and he also saw albert withdraw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he passed his hand across his forehead , which was clouded with doubt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , he exclaimed ,  - how can i restore the happiness i have taken away from these poor innocent creatures? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god help me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prisoners , in their expressive language , have named it the  - lions  den , probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars , and sometimes the keepers also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls , over which the sun glances obliquely , when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical deformity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this paved yard are to be seen ,pacing to and fro from morning till night , pale , careworn , and haggard , like so many shadows ,the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is sharpening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a wretched , damp , nay , even horrible spot , more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron bars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man , if those clothes had not been torn to shreds; still they did not show signs of wear , and the fine cloth , beneath the careful hands of the prisoner , soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect , for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a shirt , which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison , and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some of the inmates of the  - lions  den were watching the operations of the prisoner s toilet with considerable interest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - see , the prince is pluming himself , said one of the thieves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his coat looks nearly new , and his boots are brilliant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is pleasant to have such well - dressed brethren; and those gendarmes behaved shamefully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he looks like a big - bug , said another;  - dresses in fine style . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , then , to be here so young! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket , against which one of the keepers was leaning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , sir , he said ,  - lend me twenty francs; you will soon be paid; you run no risks with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> remember , i have relations who possess more millions than you have deniers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , i beseech you , lend me twenty francs , so that i may buy a dressing - gown; it is intolerable always to be in a coat and boots! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what a coat , sir , for a prince of the cavalcanti! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the keeper turned his back , and shrugged his shoulders; he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so; he had heard so many utter the same things ,indeed , he heard nothing else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , said andrea ,  - you are a man void of compassion; i ll have you turned out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this made the keeper turn around , and he burst into a loud laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i tell you that with that wretched sum , continued andrea ,  - i could obtain a coat , and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of courseof course , said the prisoners; - anyone can see he s a gentleman! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , lend him the twenty francs , said the keeper , leaning on the other shoulder;  - surely you will not refuse a comrade! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am no comrade of these people , said the young man , proudly ,  - you have no right to insult me thus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us horsewhip the fine gentleman! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right; that he intended to be civil , in his way , and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience ,and the mob retired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person , attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions  den to something more substantial than mere fascination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly a voice was heard at the wicket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - benedetto! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed an inspector . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to the visitors  room! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the same voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see someone pays me a visit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , my dear sir , you will see whether a cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down , certainly , but not forever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it might alienate my protector . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has two means of extricating me from this dilemma ,the one by a mysterious escape , managed through bribery; the other by buying off my judges with gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack , and rude in the defence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspector s voice called him to the visiting - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind the grating of the room into which andrea had been led , he saw , while his eyes dilated with surprise , the dark and intelligent face of m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio , who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars , the bolted doors , and the shadow which moved behind the other grating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good morning , benedetto , said bertuccio , with his deep , hollow voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - youyou? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the young man , looking fearfully around him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you not recognize me , unhappy child? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - silence ,be silent! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said andrea , who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls;  - for heaven s sake , do not speak so loud! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you wish to speak with me alone , do you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said bertuccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - read? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an order to conduct you to a room , and to leave you there to talk to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , cried andrea , leaping with joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am not forgotten . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they wish for secrecy , since we are to converse in a private room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i understand , bertuccio has been sent by my protector . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the keeper spoke for a moment with an official , then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the room was whitewashed , as is the custom in prisons , but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner , though a stove , a bed , a chair , and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bertuccio sat down upon the chair , andrea threw himself upon the bed; the keeper retired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said the steward ,  - what have you to tell me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said andrea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you speak first . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , and to the point . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us dispense with useless words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who sends you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i recognized you , some time since , as the insolent dandy who so gracefully mounted his horse in the champs - lyses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the champs - lyses? </s> </s>

<s> <s> come , speak , my worthy corsican , speak! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you wish me to say? </s> </s>

<s> <s> you were speaking of the champs - lyses just now , worthy foster - father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , in the champs - lyses there resides a very rich gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i believe i did . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - menacesi do not fear them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will say<s> <s>  - do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said bertuccio , in so calm a tone , and with so steadfast a look , that andrea was moved to the very soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> benedetto , you are fallen into terrible hands; they are ready to open for youmake use of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my fatheri will know who my father is , said the obstinate youth;  - i will perish if i must , but i will know it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what possessions , what reputation , what pull ,  as beauchamp says ,have i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you great people always lose something by scandal , notwithstanding your millions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just then the door opened , and the jailer , addressing himself to bertuccio , said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excuse me , sir , but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will return tomorrow , said bertuccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gendarmes , i am at your service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , sir , do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that i may have some things i am in need of! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it shall be done , replied bertuccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can i be deceived? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tomorrow , then! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he added , turning towards bertuccio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tomorrow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied the steward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abb , perhaps his kind charity , perhaps his persuasive words , which had restored the courage of noirtier , for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole establishment had been changed; another valet was engaged for himself , a new servant for noirtier , two women had entered madame de villefort s service ,in fact , everywhere , to the concierge and coachmen , new faces were presented to the different masters of the house , thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the assizes , also , were about to begin , and villefort , shut up in his room , exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of caderousse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort , who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever , to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once only had villefort seen his father; it was the day after that upon which bertuccio had paid his second visit to benedetto , when the latter was to learn his father s name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the magistrate , harassed and fatigued , had descended to the garden of his house , and in a gloomy mood , similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies , he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose - trees , which , placed along the avenue , seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while doing so , he observed m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier continued to look at the same object , but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband , and villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes , which , while changing their direction and even their language , had lost none of their menacing expression . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort , unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head , at that moment held her son s ball , and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort wiped his forehead , pressed her lips upon it , and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , drawn by an irresistible attraction , like that of the bird to the serpent , walked towards the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he approached it , noirtier s gaze followed him , and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach , as well as a terrible menace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven , as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is well , sir , replied villefort from below , - it is well; have patience but one day longer; what i have said i will do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the night was cold and still; the family had all retired to rest but villefort , who alone remained up , and worked till five o clock in the morning , reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates , compiling the depositions of the witnesses , and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation , which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day , monday , was the first sitting of the assizes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the morning dawned dull and gloomy , and villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles; its flickerings awoke him , and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the damps of the dew bathed the head of villefort , and refreshed his memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of noirtier s room , where he had seen him the preceding night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curtain was drawn , and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open , and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , he murmured , - yes , be satisfied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his head dropped upon his chest , and in this position he paced his study; then he threw himself , dressed as he was , upon a sofa , less to sleep than to rest his limbs , cramped with cold and study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , from his study , heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a house ,the opening and shutting of doors , the ringing of madame de villefort s bell , to summon the waiting - maid , mingled with the first shouts of the child , who rose full of the enjoyment of his age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort also rang; his new valet brought him the papers , and with them a cup of chocolate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what are you bringing me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a cup of chocolate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did not ask for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who has paid me this attention? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my mistress , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case , and that you should take something to keep up your strength; and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa , which was , like all the rest , covered with papers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the valet then left the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression , then , suddenly , taking it up with a nervous motion , he swallowed its contents at one draught . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal , and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the chocolate was inoffensive , for m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the breakfast - hour arrived , but m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort was not at table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the valet re - entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said villefort ,  - what then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame de villefort is dressed; she is quite ready , and wishes to know if she is to accompany you , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where to? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my mistress wishes much to be present at the trial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , said villefort , with a startling accent;  - does she wish that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the servant drew back and said ,  - if you wish to go alone , sir , i will go and tell my mistress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort remained silent for a moment , and dented his pale cheeks with his nails . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the valet re - appeared almost instantly , and , having shaved his master , assisted him to dress entirely in black . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my mistress said she should expect you , sir , as soon as you had finished dressing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am going to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and villefort , with his papers under his arm and hat in hand , directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp , pale brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then entered the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was dressed to go out , her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair , and her gloves were on her hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , here you are , monsieur , she said in her naturally calm voice;  - but how pale you are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why did you not come down to breakfast? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , will you take me , or shall i take edward? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer , but to all her inquiries m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort remained mute and cold as a statue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edward raised his head , looked at his mother , and then , finding that she did not confirm the order , began cutting off the heads of his leaden soldiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - edward , cried m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , so harshly that the child started up from the floor ,  - do you hear me? go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the child , unaccustomed to such treatment , arose , pale and trembling; it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> edward ran out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort went to the door , which he closed behind the child , and bolted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dear me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the young woman , endeavoring to read her husband s inmost thoughts , while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of villefort;  - what is the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - madame , where do you keep the poison you generally use? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the magistrate , without any introduction , placing himself between his wife and the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which , looking up , sees the murderous trap closing over its head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a hoarse , broken tone , which was neither a cry nor a sigh , escaped from her , while she became deadly pale . </s> </s>

<s> <s> de saint - mran , my mother - in - law , madame de saint - mran , barrois , and my daughter valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , sir , exclaimed madame de villefort , clasping her hands ,  - what do you say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it to the judge or to the husband? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stammered madame de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman , the anguish of her look , the trembling of her whole frame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you do not answer , madame! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the terrible interrogator . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since the death of madame de saint - mran , i have known that a poisoner lived in my house . </s> </s>

<s> <s> d avrigny warned me of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angel ,those suspicions which , even when there is no crime , are always alive in my heart; but after the death of valentine , there has been no doubt in my mind , madame , and not only in mine , but in those of others; thus your crime , known by two persons , suspected by many , will soon become public , and , as i told you just now , you no longer speak to the husband , but to the judge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young woman hid her face in her hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but i have always observed that poisoners were cowards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can you be a coward , you , who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sir! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can you be a coward? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continued villefort , with increasing excitement ,  - you , who could count , one by one , the minutes of four death agonies? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you , who have arranged your infernal plans , and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , it is impossibleyou must have saved some surer , more subtle and deadly poison than any other , that you might escape the punishment that you deserve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have done thisi hope so , at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i understand , he said ,  - you confess; but a confession made to the judges , a confession made at the last moment , extorted when the crime cannot be denied , diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the punishment? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed madame de villefort ,  - the punishment , monsieur? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> twice you have pronounced that word! </s> </s>

<s> <s> did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces it? no , madame , no; the scaffold awaits the poisoner , whoever she may be , unless , as i just said , the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> madame de villefort uttered a wild cry , and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stammered the unhappy woman , completely overwhelmed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not , by her infamy , soil an unblemished name; that she shall not , with one blow , dishonor her husband and her child . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - what i require is , that justice be done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to you i will say , have you not , madame , put aside some of the surest , deadliest , most speedy poison?  <s> <s>  - oh , pardon me , sir; let me live! </s> </s>

<s> <s> as for the accused himself , many remembered him as being so amiable , so handsome , and so liberal , that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy , since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - well , he told me that benedetto , who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning , is really but a very commonplace , silly rascal , and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs after his death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bah , said beauchamp ,  - he played the prince very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , for you who detest those unhappy princes , beauchamp , and are always delighted to find fault with them; but not for me , who discover a gentleman by instinct , and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , yes , said chteau - renaud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the idea of thinking ministers understand anything about princes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is something in what you have just said , said beauchamp , laughing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was an impossibility; for the last week m . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whom do you mean? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - why not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - has he assassinated anyone , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , on the contrary , they wished to assassinate him . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the court , gentlemen! </s> </s>

<s> <s> everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face , whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb , and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gendarmes , said the president ,  - lead in the accused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at these words the public attention became more intense , and all eyes were turned towards the door through which benedetto was to enter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door soon opened and the accused appeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same impression was experienced by all present , and no one was deceived by the expression of his countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants; his eye rested longer on the president , and still more so on the king s attorney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the side of andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence , and who had been appointed by the court , for andrea disdained to pay any attention to those details , to which he appeared to attach no importance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the prisoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the reading of this , which was long , the public attention was continually drawn towards andrea , who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the crime was depicted in the most vivid colors; the former life of the prisoner , his transformation , a review of his life from the earliest period , were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , who examined him attentively , and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use , in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes , notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length the reading of the indictment was ended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrea arose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> president , he said , in a clear voice ,  - but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i cannot follow you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have an idea , which i will explain by and by , of making an exception to the usual form of accusation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> allow me , then , if you please , to answer in different order , or i will not do so at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your age? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the president;  - will you answer that question? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will answer that question , as well as the rest , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> president , but in its turn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your age? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am twenty - one years old , or rather i shall be in a few days , as i was born the night of the 27th of september , 1817 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , who was busy taking down some notes , raised his head at the mention of this date . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where were you born? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your profession? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - first i was a forger , answered andrea , as calmly as possible;  - then i became a thief , and lately have become an assassin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a murmur , or rather storm , of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly . </s> </s>

<s> <s> asked benedetto , with his most ingratiating smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now , prisoner , will you consent to tell your name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court , both in the name of morality , and for the respect due to humanity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you wished it to be preceded by all these titles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is quite wonderful , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> president , how entirely you have read my thoughts , said benedetto , in his softest voice and most polite manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the president;  - your name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a painful giddiness overwhelmed villefort; great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - repeat your father s name , said the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my father is king s attorney , replied andrea calmly . </s> </s>

<s> <s> de villefort;  - king s attorney? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; and if you wish to know his name , i will tell it ,he is named villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the explosion , which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice , now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present; the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the exclamations , the insults addressed to benedetto , who remained perfectly unconcerned , the energetic gestures , the movement of the gendarmes , the sneers of the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbanceall this lasted five minutes , before the door - keepers and magistrates were able to restore silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you playing with justice , accused , and do you dare set your fellow - citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , who sat half bowed over in his chair , offering him consolation , encouragement , and protestations of zeal and sympathy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a lady , it was said , had just fainted; they had supplied her with a smelling - bottle , and she had recovered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the scene of tumult , andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly; then , leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock , in the most graceful attitude possible , he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentlemen , i assure you i had no idea of insulting the court , or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they ask where i was born; i answer . </s> </s>

<s> <s> all eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur , who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a corpse . </s> </s>

<s> <s> de villefort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you wish for any further details? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will give them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was born in no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 28 , rue de la fontaine , in a room hung with red damask; my father took me in his arms , telling my mother i was dead , wrapped me in a napkin marked with an h and an n , and carried me into a garden , where he buried me alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but how have you become acquainted with all these details? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man who had sworn vengeance against my father , and had long watched his opportunity to kill him , had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was concealed in a thicket; he saw my father bury something in the ground , and stabbed him; then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground , and found me still living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man carried me to the foundling asylum , where i was registered under the number 37 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three months afterwards , a woman travelled from rogliano to paris to fetch me , and having claimed me as her son , carried me away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , you see , though born in paris , i was brought up in corsica . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a moment s silence , during which one could have fancied the hall empty , so profound was the stillness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - proceed , said the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , i might have lived happily amongst those good people , who adored me , but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i increased in wickedness till i committed crime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked , and ordaining me to such a fate , my adopted father said to me , do not blaspheme , unhappy child , the crime is that of your father , not yours ,of your father , who consigned you to hell if you died , and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but your mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the president . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my mother thought me dead; she is not guilty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just then a piercing cry , ending in a sob , burst from the centre of the crowd , who encircled the lady who had before fainted , and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was carried out of the hall , the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off , and madame danglars was recognized . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> notwithstanding his shattered nerves , the ringing sensation in his ears , and the madness which turned his brain , villefort rose as he perceived her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the proofs , the proofs! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said benedetto , laughing;  - do you want proofs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - father , said benedetto ,  - i am asked for proofs , do you wish me to give them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , it is useless , stammered m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how useless? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i mean that i feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gentlemen , i know i am in the hands of an avenging god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we need no proofs; everything relating to this young man is true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a dull , gloomy silence , like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature , pervaded the assembly , who shuddered in dismay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort , cried the president ,  - do you yield to an hallucination? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what , are you no longer in possession of your senses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this strange , unexpected , terrible accusation has disordered your reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , recover . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am in possession of all my senses , sir , he said;  - my body alone suffers , as you may suppose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me , and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as he spoke these words with a hoarse , choking voice , he staggered towards the door , which was mechanically opened by a door - keeper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the parisian world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ma foi! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de morcerf; a pistol - shot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and moreover , it kills , said beauchamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter , said debray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the sitting is adjourned , gentlemen , said the president;  - fresh inquiries will be made , and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for andrea , who was calm and more interesting than ever , he left the hall , escorted by gendarmes , who involuntarily paid him some attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked debray of the sergeant - at - arms , slipping a louis into his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> notwithstanding the density of the crowd , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is something so awe - inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many people have been assassinated in a tumult , but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais , and withdrew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though he had acknowledged his guilt , he was protected by his grief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are some situations which men understand by instinct , but which reason is powerless to explain; in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem , and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every pulse beat with feverish excitement , every nerve was strained , every vein swollen , and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest , thus multiplying his agony a thousand - fold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he made his way along the corridors through force of habit; he threw aside his magisterial robe , not out of deference to etiquette , but because it was an unbearable burden , a veritable garb of nessus , insatiate in torture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having staggered as far as the rue dauphine , he perceived his carriage , awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself , threw himself on the cushions , and pointed towards the faubourg saint - honor; the carriage drove on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him; he could not foresee the consequences; he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god was still in his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - god , he murmured , not knowing what he said , - godgod! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carriage rolled rapidly onward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , while turning restlessly on the cushions , felt something press against him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he exclaimed , as though a red - hot iron were piercing his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind; now another object , not less terrible , suddenly presented itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his wife! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had just acted the inexorable judge with her , he had condemned her to death , and she , crushed by remorse , struck with terror , covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable virtue ,she , a poor , weak woman , without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will ,she might at that very moment , perhaps , be preparing to die! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort again groaned with anguish and despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , he exclaimed ,  - that woman became criminal only from associating with me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i carried the infection of crime with me , and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever , the cholera , the plague! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet i have punished heri have dared to tell heri haverepent and die!   but no , she must not die; she shall live , and with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i told her of the scaffold; oh , heavens , i forgot that it awaits me also! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how could i pronounce that word? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , we will fly; i will confess all to her ,i will tell her daily that i also have committed a crime! oh , what an alliancethe tiger and the serpent; worthy wife of such as i am! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she must live that my infamy may diminish hers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - faster , faster! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the horses , impelled by fear , flew towards the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , repeated villefort , as he approached his home - yes , that woman must live; she must repent , and educate my son , the sole survivor , with the exception of the indestructible old man , of the wreck of my house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the events which have taken place in my house , though they now occupy the public mind , will be forgotten in time , or if , indeed , a few enemies should persist in remembering them , why then i will add them to my list of crimes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall have performed a good action , and my heart will be lighter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort leaped out of the carriage , and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return; he could read no other expression on their features . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> neither of them spoke to him; they merely stood aside to let him pass by , as usual , nothing more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he passed by m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noirtier s room , he perceived two figures through the half - open door; but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father; anxiety carried him on further . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , he said , as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife s room ,  - nothing is changed here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then closed the door of the landing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no one must disturb us , he said;  - i must speak freely to her , accuse myself , and sayhe approached the door , touched the crystal handle , which yielded to his hand . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - hlose! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he repeated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who is there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - open; it is i . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but notwithstanding this request , notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered , the door remained closed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort burst it open with a violent blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir , madame de villefort was standing erect , pale , her features contracted , and her eyes glaring horribly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hlose , hlose! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said ,  - what is the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> speak! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young woman extended her stiff white hands towards him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what more do you want? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and she fell full length on the floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort ran to her and seized her hand , which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , maddened with horror , stepped back to the threshhold of the door , fixing his eyes on the corpse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he exclaimed suddenly ,  - where is my son? edward , edward! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where is my son? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then he must be playing in the garden; go and see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir; madame de villefort sent for him half an hour ago; he went into her room , and has not been downstairs since . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a cold perspiration burst out on villefort s brow; his legs trembled , and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to call edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre; to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his tongue was paralyzed in his mouth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - edward! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stammered - edward! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the child did not answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where , then , could he be , if he had entered his mother s room and not since returned? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the corpse of madame de villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which edward must be; those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold , and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir , containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort stepped forward two or three paces , and beheld his child lyingno doubt asleepon the sofa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy; a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had only to step over the corpse , enter the boudoir , take the child in his arms , and flee far , far away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort was no longer the civilized man; he was a tiger hurt unto death , gnashing his teeth in his wound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he no longer feared realities , but phantoms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he pressed his burning lips to the cheeks , but they were icy cold and pale; he felt the stiffened limbs; he pressed his hand upon the heart , but it no longer beat ,the child was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a folded paper fell from edward s breast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , thunderstruck , fell upon his knees; the child dropped from his arms , and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know that i was a good mother , since it was for my son s sake i became criminal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a good mother cannot depart without her son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort could not believe his eyes ,he could not believe his reason; he dragged himself towards the child s body , and examined it as a lioness contemplates its dead cub . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> until then he had been sustained by rage , by his strength of mind , by despair , by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens , and ajax to defy the gods . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he now arose , his head bowed beneath the weight of grief , and , shaking his damp , dishevelled hair , he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father , that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes ,someone by whose side he might weep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the abb busoni , who looked cold and calm , as usual . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> villefort , perceiving the abb , passed his hand across his brow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the past came to him like one of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil , and then the visit the abb had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine s death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> busoni turned around , and , perceiving the excitement depicted on the magistrate s face , the savage lustre of his eyes , he understood that the revelation had been made at the assizes; but beyond this he was ignorant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt , and that from this moment i will pray to god to forgive you , as i do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed villefort , stepping back fearfully ,  - surely that is not the voice of the abb busoni! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the procureur , with a haggard expression . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are not exactly right , m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> procureur; you must go farther back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that voice , that voice! where did i first hear it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you heard it for the first time at marseilles , twenty - three years ago , the day of your marriage with mademoiselle de saint - mran . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are , then , some secret , implacable , and mortal enemy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must have wronged you in some way at marseilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , woe to me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; you are now on the right path , said the count , crossing his arms over his broad chest;  - searchsearch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what have i done to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed villefort , whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity , in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality;  - what have i done to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you condemned me to a horrible , tedious death; you killed my father; you deprived me of liberty , of love , and happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the chteau d if . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the king s attorney;  - you are<s> <s>  - i am edmond dants! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are edmond dants , cried villefort , seizing the count by the wrist;  - then come here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and up the stairs he dragged monte cristo; who , ignorant of what had happened , followed him in astonishment , foreseeing some new catastrophe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said , pointing to the bodies of his wife and child ,  - see , are you well avenged? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child , reopened its eyes , felt its pulse , and then rushed with him into valentine s room , of which he double - locked the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my child , cried villefort ,  - he carries away the body of my child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , curses , woe , death to you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this lasted several minutes , until the frightful overturn of reason was accomplished; then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter , he rushed down the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a quarter of an hour afterwards the door of valentine s room opened , and monte cristo reappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in his arms he held the child , whom no skill had been able to recall to life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bending on one knee , he placed it reverently by the side of its mother , with its head upon her breast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , rising , he went out , and meeting a servant on the stairs , he asked: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where is m . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> de villefort? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo ran down the steps , and advancing towards the spot designated beheld villefort , encircled by his servants , with a spade in his hand , and digging the earth with fury . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then he moved farther on , and began again to dig . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo approached him , and said in a low voice , with an expression almost humble: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo drew back in horror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him , he rushed into the street , for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , enough of this ,enough of this , he cried;  - let me save the last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on entering his house , he met morrel , who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you nothing more to do there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied monte cristo;  - god grant i may not have done too much already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day they indeed left , accompanied only by baptistin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hayde had taken away ali , and bertuccio remained with noirtier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian , who was paying them a visit , listened to their conversation , or rather was present at it , plunged in his accustomed state of apathy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed , said julie ,  - might we not almost fancy , emmanuel , that those people , so rich , so happy but yesterday , had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil geniuslike the wicked fairies in perrault s stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptismhovered over them , and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said emmanuel , thinking of morcerf and danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what dreadful sufferings! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said julie , remembering valentine , but whom , with a delicacy natural to women , she did not name before her brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when my father , with a pistol in his hand , was once on the point of committing suicide , had anyone then said , this man deserves his misery ,  would not that person have been deceived? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but your father was not allowed to fall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell was heard , the well - known signal given by the porter that a visitor had arrived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count of monte cristo appeared on the threshold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young people uttered a cry of joy , while maximilian raised his head , but let it fall again immediately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to seek me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated morrel , as if awakening from a dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said monte cristo;  - has it not been agreed that i should take you with me , and did i not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am ready , said maximilian;  - i came expressly to wish them farewell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whither are you going , count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to marseilles! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , and i take your brother with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said julie ,  - will you restore him to us cured of his melancholy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you perceive , then , that he is not happy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the young woman;  - and fear much that he finds our home but a dull one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am ready to accompany you , sir , said maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - adieu , my kind friends! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> emmanueljuliefarewell! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how farewell? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed julie;  - do you leave us thus , so suddenly , without any preparations for your journey , without even a passport? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - needless delays but increase the grief of parting , said monte cristo ,  - and maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite; at least , i advised him to do so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have a passport , and my clothes are ready packed , said morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and you leave us , said julie ,  - at a moment s warning? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you do not give us a dayno , not even an hour before your departure? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my carriage is at the door , madame , and i must be in rome in five days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed emmanuel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , heavens , how strangely he expresses himself , count! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - maximilian goes with me , said the count , in his kindest and most persuasive manner;  - therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brother s account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - once more farewell , my dear sister; emmanuel , adieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel repeated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart , said julie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pshaw! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monte cristo ,  - you will see him return to you gay , smiling , and joyful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian cast a look of disdain , almost of anger , on the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we must leave you , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - before you quit us , count , said julie ,  - will you permit us to express to you all that the other day<s> <s>  - madame , interrupted the count , taking her two hands in his ,  - all that you could say in words would never express what i read in your eyes; the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like benefactors in romances , i should have left you without seeing you again , but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength , because i am a weak and vain man , fond of the tender , kind , and thankful glances of my fellow - creatures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the eve of departure i carry my egotism so far as to say , do not forget me , my kind friends , for probably you will never see me again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed emmanuel , while two large tears rolled down julie s cheeks ,  - never behold you again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not a man , then , but some angel that leaves us , and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fate is not more powerful than they; it is they who , on the contrary , overcome fate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and pressing his lips on the hand of julie , who rushed into his arms , he extended his other hand to emmanuel; then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness , he made a sign to maximilian , who followed him passively , with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - restore my brother to peace and happiness , whispered julie to monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the count pressed her hand in reply , as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrel s study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked he , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , was the ready answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , sleep in peace , and put your trust in the lord . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as we have before said , the post - chaise was waiting; four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience , while ali , apparently just arrived from a long walk , was standing at the foot of the steps , his face bathed in perspiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali made a sign in the affirmative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and have you placed the letter before him , as i ordered you to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the slave respectfully signalized that he had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali placed himself in the light , so that his master might see him distinctly , and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man , he closed his eyes , as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good; he accepts , said monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now let us go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these words had scarcely escaped him , when the carriage was on its way , and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with folded arms , he gazed for some time upon the great city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he had fixed his piercing look on this modern babylon , which equally engages the contemplation of the religious enthusiast , the materialist , and the scoffer ,<s> <s>  - great city , murmured he , inclining his head , and joining his hands as if in prayer ,  - less than six months have elapsed since first i entered thy gates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , great city , it is in thy palpitating bosom that i have found that which i sought; like a patient miner , i have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> adieu , paris , adieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night; he passed his hand over his brow , got into the carriage , the door was closed on him , and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - morrel , said the count to him at length ,  - do you repent having followed me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - valentine reposes within the walls of paris , and to leave paris is like losing her a second time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - maximilian , said the count ,  - the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth , but are buried deep in our hearts , and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have two friends , who in this way never depart from me; the one who gave me being , and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their spirits live in me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i consult them when doubtful , and if i ever do any good , it is due to their beneficent counsels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> listen to the voice of your heart , morrel , and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the soul forms its own horizons; your soul is darkened , and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that may possibly be true , said maximilian , and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever commanded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> towns fled from them like shadows on their path , and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them , and retreating as rapidly when once reached . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the following morning they arrived at chlons , where the count s steamboat waited for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without the loss of an instant , the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> powerful memories were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower , fort saint - nicolas , the city hall designed by puget ,[28] the port with its brick quays , where they had both played in childhood , and it was with one accord that they stopped on the canebire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a vessel was setting sail for algiers , on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the passengers and their relations crowded on the deck , friends taking a tender but sorrowful leave of each other , some weeping , others noisy in their grief , the whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who witnessed similar sights daily , but which had no power to disturb the current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of maximilian from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i yet feel his warm tears on my face , and his were not the only tears shed , for many who witnessed our meeting wept also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo gently smiled and said , - i was there; at the same time pointing to the corner of a street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke , and in the very direction he indicated , a groan , expressive of bitter grief , was heard , and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel about to sail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed morrel ,  - i do not deceive myselfthat young man who is waving his hat , that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant , is albert de morcerf! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said monte cristo ,  - i recognized him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how so? you were looking the other way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> turning to his friend: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dear maximilian , said the count ,  - have you nothing to do in this land? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have to weep over the grave of my father , replied morrel in a broken voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , go ,wait for me there , and i will soon join you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; i also have a pious visit to pay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him; then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it yet stood , under the shade of the fine avenue of lime - trees , which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of marseilles , covered by an immense vine , which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the stone front , burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door , which was made of three planks; the door had never been painted or varnished , so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the house , with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery , was yet cheerful and picturesque , and was the same that old dants formerly inhabitedthe only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret , while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercds by the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house; she had scarcely closed the door after her when monte cristo appeared at the corner of a street , so that he found and lost her again almost at the same instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the worn out steps were old acquaintances of his; he knew better than anyone else how to open that weather - beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he entered without knocking , or giving any other intimation of his presence , as if he had been a friend or the master of the place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the end of a passage paved with bricks , was a little garden , bathed in sunshine , and rich in warmth and light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this garden mercds had found , at the place indicated by the count , the sum of money which he , through a sense of delicacy , had described as having been placed there twenty - four years previously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the street - door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo , on stepping into the house , heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob; he looked in the direction whence it came , and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine ,[29] with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers , he saw mercds seated , with her head bowed , and weeping bitterly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had raised her veil , and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo advanced a few steps , which were heard on the gravel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am , indeed , most wretched , replied mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alone in the world , i had but my son , and he has left me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he possesses a noble heart , madame , replied the count ,  - and he has acted rightly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he feels that every man owes a tribute to his country; some contribute their talents , others their industry; these devote their blood , those their nightly labors , to the same cause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had he remained with you , his life must have become a hateful burden , nor would he have participated in your griefs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity , which he will convert into prosperity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leave him to build up the future for you , and i venture to say you will confide it to safe hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , replied the wretched woman , mournfully shaking her head ,  - the prosperity of which you speak , and which , from the bottom of my heart , i pray god in his mercy to grant him , i can never enjoy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have acted kindly , count , in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - oh , look at me , continued she , with a feeling of profound melancholy ,  - my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy , for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dants , who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret , then inhabited by his old father . </s> </s>

<s> <s> nay , do not press my hand , edmond; you are thinking , i am sure , of some kind speech to console me , but do not utter it to me , reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i cannot have deceived myself , he said;  - i must look upon the past in a false light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he continued ,  - can i have been following a false path? can the end which i proposed be a mistaken end? can one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible , if not a sacrilegious , undertaking? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i cannot reconcile myself to this ideait would madden me . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but notwithstanding the serene sky , the gracefully formed boats , and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed , the count of monte cristo , wrapped in his cloak , could think only of this terrible voyage , the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the solitary light burning at the catalans; that first sight of the chteau d if , which told him whither they were leading him; the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard; his despair when he found himself vanquished , and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his foreheadall these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up , and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop , so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they reached the shore , the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat , and the owner was obliged to call out , in his sweetest tone of voice: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo remembered that on that very spot , on the same rock , he had been violently dragged by the guards , who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the journey had seemed very long to dants , but monte cristo found it equally short . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas , which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there had been no prisoners confined in the chteau d if since the revolution of july; it was only inhabited by a guard , kept there for the prevention of smuggling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity , once a scene of terror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the concierge who attended him had only been there since 1830 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed , since then removed , and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the abb faria had been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo felt his limbs tremble; he seated himself upon a log of wood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of mirabeau? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the count;  - are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodes ,in which it is difficult to believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow - creatures? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo shuddered; antoine had been his jailer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had almost forgotten his name and face , but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it , the face encircled by a beard , wearing the brown jacket , the bunch of keys , the jingling of which he still seemed to hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count turned around , and fancied he saw him in the corridor , rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - would you like to hear the story , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; relate it , said monte cristo , pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings; he felt afraid of hearing his own history . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this dungeon , said the concierge ,  - was , it appears , some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner , the more so since he was full of industry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another person was confined in the chteau at the same time , but he was not wicked , he was only a poor mad priest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , indeed? mad! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated monte cristo;  - and what was his mania? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - could the prisoners see each other? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , sir , it was expressly forbidden; but they eluded the vigilance of the guards , and made a passage from one dungeon to the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and which of them made this passage? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , it must have been the young man , certainly , for he was strong and industrious , while the abb was aged and weak; besides , his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - blind fools! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - however , be that as it may , the young man made a tunnel , how or by what means no one knows; but he made it , and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you see it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the man held the torch to the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day the old man fell ill and died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now guess what the young one did? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he carried off the corpse , which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall; then he entered the empty dungeon , closed the entrance , and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they never buried the dead; they merely attached a heavy cannon - ball to the feet , and then threw them into the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man was thrown from the top of the rock; the corpse was found on the bed next day , and the whole truth was guessed , for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before , that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep , they heard a shriek , which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , he muttered ,  - the doubt i felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness; but here the wound reopens , and the heart again thirsts for vengeance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the prisoner , he continued aloud ,  - was he ever heard of afterwards? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can understand that one of two things must have happened; he must either have fallen flat , in which case the blow , from a height of ninety feet , must have killed him instantly , or he must have fallen upright , and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom , where he remainedpoor fellow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , the count added aloud ,  - was his name ever known? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes; but only as no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 34 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , villefort , villefort , murmured the count ,  - this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you wish to see anything more , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the concierge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , especially if you will show me the poor abb s room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 27 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated the count , who seemed to hear the voice of the abb answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait , said monte cristo ,  - i wish to take one final glance around this room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is fortunate , said the guide;  - i have forgotten the other key . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go and fetch it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will leave you the torch , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , take it away; i can see in the dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , you are like no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> 34 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he spent fourteen years to arrive at that , muttered the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the guide carried away the torch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count had spoken correctly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely had a few seconds elapsed , ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he looked around him , and really recognized his dungeon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , he said ,  - there is the stone upon which i used to sit; there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall; there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , those figures , how well i remember them! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i made them one day to calculate the age of my father , that i might know whether i should find him still living , and that of mercds , to know if i should find her still free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after finishing that calculation , i had a minute s hope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and a bitter laugh escaped the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw in fancy the burial of his father , and the marriage of mercds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription , the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , god!   he read ,  - preserve my memory!  <s> <s>  - oh , yes , he cried ,  - that was my only prayer at last; i no longer begged for liberty , but memory; i dreaded to become mad and forgetful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , god , thou hast preserved my memory; i thank thee , i thank thee! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall; the guide was coming; monte cristo went to meet him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there , again , monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first thing that met his eye was the meridian , drawn by the abb on the wall , by which he calculated the time; then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sight of this , instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon , filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment , and tears fell from his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is where the mad abb was kept , sir , and that is where the young man entered; and the guide pointed to the opening , which had remained unclosed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from the appearance of the stone , he continued ,  - a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor things! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the guide took them , thinking them merely a few pieces of little value; but the light of the torch revealed their true worth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , he said ,  - you have made a mistake; you have given me gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the concierge looked upon the count with surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sir , he cried , scarcely able to believe his good fortune - sir , i cannot understand your generosity! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , sir , since you are so liberal , i ought to offer you something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what have you to offer to me , my friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shells? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thank you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir , neither of those; something connected with this story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , said the guide;  - i said to myself , something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years ,  so i began to sound the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said the count ,  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i raised the stones , and found<s> <s>  - a rope - ladder and some tools? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how do you know that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the guide in astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not knowi only guess it , because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners  cells . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , a rope - ladder and tools . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and have you them yet? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir; i sold them to visitors , who considered them great curiosities; but i have still something left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the count , impatiently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a sort of book , written upon strips of cloth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go and fetch it , my good fellow; and if it be what i hope , you will do well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will run for it , sir; and the guide went out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the count knelt down by the side of the bed , which death had converted into an altar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , second father , he exclaimed ,  - thou who hast given me liberty , knowledge , riches; thou who , like beings of a superior order to ourselves , couldst understand the science of good and evil; if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth; if after death the soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered ,then , noble heart , sublime soul , then i conjure thee by the paternal love thou didst bear me , by the filial obedience i vowed to thee , grant me some sign , some revelation! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> remove from me the remains of doubt , which , if it change not to conviction , must become remorse! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count bowed his head , and clasped his hands together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here , sir , said a voice behind him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo shuddered , and arose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the abb faria had spread the riches of his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the manuscript was the great work by the abb faria upon the kingdoms of italy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thou shalt tear out the dragons  teeth , and shall trample the lions under foot , saith the lord . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thanks , father , thanks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you give it to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone; and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found , which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel , he rushed out of the corridor , and reaching his boat , cried ,  - to marseilles! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - woe , he cried ,  - to those who confined me in that wretched prison; and woe to those who forgot that i was there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he repassed the catalans , the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the victory was complete; twice he had overcome his doubts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he , too , ten years ago , had piously sought out a tomb , and sought it vainly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he , who returned to france with millions , had been unable to find the grave of his father , who had perished from hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the worthy merchant had been more fortunate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dying in the arms of his children , he had been by them laid by the side of his wife , who had preceded him in eternity by two years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel was leaning against one of these , mechanically fixing his eyes on the graves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - maximilian , said the count ,  - you should not look on the graves , but there; and he pointed upwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the dead are everywhere , said morrel;  - did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - maximilian , said the count ,  - you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at marseilles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you still wish to do so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have no wishes , count; only i fancy i could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so much the better , for i must leave you; but i carry your word with me , do i not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , count , i shall forget it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , count , have pity upon me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am so unhappy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have known a man much more unfortunate than you , morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - impossible! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alas , said monte cristo ,  - it is the infirmity of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , morrel , and pay attention to what i am about to tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was young , he had an old father whom he loved , a betrothed bride whom he adored . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was about to marry her , when one of the caprices of fate ,which would almost make us doubt the goodness of providence , if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end ,one of those caprices deprived him of his mistress , of the future of which he had dreamed ( for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present ) , and cast him into a dungeon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maximilian shuddered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fourteen years! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - during that time he had many moments of despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he also , morrel , like you , considered himself the unhappiest of men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , at the height of his despair god assisted him through human means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at first , perhaps , he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord , but at last he took patience and waited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day he miraculously left the prison , transformed , rich , powerful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his first cry was for his father; but that father was dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my father , too , is dead , said morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; but your father died in your arms , happy , respected , rich , and full of years; his father died poor , despairing , almost doubtful of providence; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards , his tomb had disappeared , and no one could say , there sleeps the father you so well loved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are deceived , morrel , that woman<s> <s>  - she was dead? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - worse than that , she was faithless , and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and has he found consolation? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has at least found peace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and does he ever expect to be happy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he hopes so , maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man s head fell on his breast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have my promise , he said , after a minute s pause , extending his hand to monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , count , do you remember that the 5th of october<s> <s>  - child , replied the count ,  - not to know the value of a man s word! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day , i will assist you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; i have business in italy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i leave you alone in your struggle with misfortunealone with that strong - winged eagle which god sends to bear aloft the elect to his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when do you leave? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - immediately; the steamer waits , and in an hour i shall be far from you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you accompany me to the harbor , maximilian? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel accompanied the count to the harbor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time that the steamer disappeared behind cape morgiou , a man travelling post on the road from florence to rome had just passed the little town of aquapendente . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man was dressed in a greatcoat , or rather a surtout , a little worse for the journey , but which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of honor still fresh and brilliant , a decoration which also ornamented the under coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he might be recognized , not only by these signs , but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion , as a frenchman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music , and which like the  - goddam of figaro , served all possible linguistic requirements . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - allegro! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he called out to the postilions at every ascent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried as they descended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and heaven knows there are hills enough between rome and florence by the way of aquapendente! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on reaching la storta , the point from whence rome is first visible , the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of saint peter s , which may be seen long before any other object is distinguishable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket , and took from it a paper folded in four , and after having examined it in a manner almost reverential , he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have it still! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carriage entered by the porta del popolo , turned to the left , and stopped at the htel d espagne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> old pastrini , our former acquaintance , received the traveller at the door , hat in hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the traveller alighted , ordered a good dinner , and inquired the address of the house of thomson & french , which was immediately given to him , as it was one of the most celebrated in rome . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the result was that when the new - comer left the hotel with the cicerone , a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers , and without having been seen by the traveller , and appearing to excite no attention from the guide , followed the stranger with as much skill as a parisian police agent would have used . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of thomson & french that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed , but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road , or to wait for him at the bankers  door . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the frenchman entered , leaving in the anteroom his guide , who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the doors of banking - houses , churches , museums , or theatres . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the frenchman , the man who had followed him entered too; the frenchman knocked at the inner door , and entered the first room; his shadow did the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - messrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> inquired the stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the attendant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - follow me , said the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a door opened , through which the attendant and the baron disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man who had followed danglars sat down on a bench . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper; he raised his head , and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , ha , he said ,  - here you are , peppino! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , was the laconic reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is no great merit due to me , for we were informed of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know his business here , then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will know presently , my friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean? of whom do you speak? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it the englishman who carried off 3 ,000 crowns from here the other day? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; he really had 3 ,000 crowns , and we found them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i mean the russian prince , who you said had 30 ,000 livres , and we only found 22 ,000 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must have searched badly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - luigi vampa himself searched . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - possibly , after all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino nodded , and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the attendant had gone out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - joy , joythe sum is large! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - five or six millions , is it not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , you know the amount . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i told you we were informed beforehand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that i may be sure i have the right man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the clerk seized his pen , and peppino his beads; one was writing and the other praying when the door opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars looked radiant with joy; the banker accompanied him to the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino followed danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> according to the arrangements , the carriage was waiting at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the guide held the door open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cicerone reclosed the door , and sprang up by the side of the coachman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino mounted the seat behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will your excellency visit saint peter s? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did not come to rome to see , said danglars aloud; then he added softly , with an avaricious smile ,  - i came to touch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he rapped his pocket - book , in which he had just placed a letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then your excellency is going<s> <s>  - to the hotel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - casa pastrini! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the cicerone to the coachman , and the carriage drove rapidly on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment , and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel , after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter , who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars was tired and sleepy; he therefore went to bed , placing his pocketbook under his pillow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino had a little spare time , so he had a game of morra with the facchini , lost three crowns , and then to console himself drank a bottle of orvieto . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next morning danglars awoke late , though he went to bed so early; he had not slept well for five or six nights , even if he had slept at all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he breakfasted heartily , and caring little , as he said , for the beauties of the eternal city , ordered post - horses at noon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the horses only arrived at two o clock , and the cicerone did not bring the passport till three . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd , who for the sake of gain styled him  - your excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the postilion in italian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the ancona road , replied the baron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> signor pastrini interpreted the question and answer , and the horses galloped off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had scarcely advanced three leagues out of rome when daylight began to disappear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars had not intended starting so late , or he would have remained; he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - non capisco ( do not understand ) , was the reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars bent his head , which he meant to imply ,  - very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carriage again moved on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash , with double springs; he was drawn by four good horses , at full gallop; he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what subject of meditation could present itself to the banker , so fortunately become bankrupt? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in paris; another ten minutes about his daughter travelling with mademoiselle d armilly; the same period was given to his creditors , and the manner in which he intended spending their money; and then , having no subject left for contemplation , he shut his eyes , and fell asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes; then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country , thickly strewn with broken aqueducts , which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars therefore continued to sleep , saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting - house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carriage stopped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars waited a moment , expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said to the postilion ,  - eh , mio caro? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was another little piece of italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing italian duets with cavalcanti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , my friend , he said , thrusting his hand through the opening ,  - where are we going? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dentro la testa! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> answered a solemn and imperious voice , accompanied by a menacing gesture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he obeyed , not without some uneasiness , which , momentarily increasing , caused his mind , instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey , to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake , more especially one in such a situation as danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly , and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before we are alarmed , we see correctly; when we are alarmed , we see double; and when we have been alarmed , we see nothing but trouble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - some gendarme! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he exclaimed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he resolved to end his anxiety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where are you taking me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dentro la testa , replied the same voice , with the same menacing accent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he threw himself back in the calash , not this time to sleep , but to think . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> directly afterwards the moon rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then saw the great aqueducts , those stone phantoms which he had before remarked , only then they were on the right hand , now they were on the left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , unfortunate! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried ,  - they must have obtained my arrest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an hour of terror elapsed , for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length he saw a dark mass , against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash; but the vehicle turned to one side , leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mon dieu! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they are robbers , perhaps , he muttered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road , and perceived monuments of a singular form , and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related , and comparing them with his own situation , he felt sure that he must be on the appian way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the left , in a sort of valley , he perceived a circular excavation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was caracalla s circus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time the door was opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars instantly descended; although he did not yet speak italian , he understood it very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> more dead than alive , he looked around him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> four men surrounded him , besides the postilion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - di qu , said one of the men , descending a little path leading out of the appian way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another , like sentinels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after walking for about ten minutes , during which danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide , he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds; three men , standing silent , formed a triangle , of which he was the centre . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wished to speak , but his tongue refused to move . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - avanti! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the same sharp and imperative voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time danglars had double reason to understand , for if the word and gesture had not explained the speaker s meaning , it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him , who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this guide was our friend peppino , who dashed into the thicket of high weeds , through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges; the rock , half open , afforded a passage to the young man , who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no longer any doubt , the bankrupt was in the hands of roman banditti . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions , and who is rendered brave by fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> notwithstanding his large stomach , certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the campagna , he slid down like peppino , and closing his eyes fell upon his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he touched the ground , he opened his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the path was wide , but dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino , who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories , struck a light and lit a torch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two other men descended after danglars forming the rearguard , and pushing danglars whenever he happened to stop , they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the walls were hollowed out in sepulchres , one above the other , and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes , like those which we see on the faces of the dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who comes there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a friend , a friend! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said peppino;  - but where is the captain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , said the sentinel , pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt , hollowed out of the rock , the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fine spoil , captain , fine spoil! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said peppino in italian , and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door , through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling - place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the captain , who was attentively reading plutarch s life of alexander . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - himself , captainhimself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well , show him to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this rather impertinent order , peppino raised his torch to the face of danglars , who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the man is tired , said the captain ,  - conduct him to his bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the banker uttered a groan and followed his guide; he neither supplicated nor exclaimed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he no longer possessed strength , will , power , or feeling; he followed where they led him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase , and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then a low door was opened before him , and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cell was clean , though empty , and dry , though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a bed of dried grass covered with goat - skins was placed in one corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars brightened up on beholding it , fancying that it gave some promise of safety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if there had been no bolt , it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sebastian , encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi vampa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars , and restored him to some degree of tranquillity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had arrested him for the purpose of robbery , and as he had only a few louis about him , he doubted not he would be ransomed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eight thousand crowns amounted to 48 ,000 livres; he would then have about 5 ,050 ,000 francs left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore , tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position , provided he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of 5 ,050 ,000 francs , he stretched himself on his bed , and after turning over two or three times , fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi vampa was studying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he awoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to a parisian accustomed to silken curtains , walls hung with velvet drapery , and the soft perfume of burning wood , the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room , the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , he murmured ,  - i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his first idea was to breathe , that he might know whether he was wounded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he borrowed this from don quixote , the only book he had ever read , but which he still slightly remembered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , he cried ,  - they have not wounded , but perhaps they have robbed me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were untouched; the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket , and in that of his greatcoat he found the little note - case containing his letter of credit for 5 ,050 ,000 francs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - singular bandits! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he exclaimed;  - they have left me my purse and pocket - book . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as i was saying last night , they intend me to be ransomed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hello , here is my watch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me see what time it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars  watch , one of breguet s repeaters , which he had carefully wound up on the previous night , struck half past five . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> without this , danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time , for daylight did not reach his cell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the last alternative seemed the most prudent , so he waited until twelve o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during all this time a sentinel , who had been relieved at eight o clock , had been watching his door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had noticed that a few rays , not of daylight , but from a lamp , penetrated through the ill - joined planks of the door; he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy , which , owing to the leathern bottle containing it , sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - faugh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at twelve this man was replaced by another functionary , and danglars , wishing to catch sight of his new guardian , approached the door again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we see that danglars was collected enough to jest; at the same time , as though to disprove the ogreish propensities , the man took some black bread , cheese , and onions from his wallet , which he began devouring voraciously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may i be hanged , said danglars , glancing at the bandit s dinner through the crevices of the door , - may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat - skin , which reminded him of the smell of the brandy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible , and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he got up and knocked on the door; the bandit raised his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars knew that he was heard , so he redoubled his blows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but whether he did not understand him , or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars , the giant , without answering , went on with his dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars  feelings were hurt , and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute , the banker threw himself down again on his goat - skin and did not breathe another word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was , indeed , peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door , and placing between his legs an earthen pan , containing chick - peas stewed with bacon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner ,  - put in your head! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - happen to be hungry ,that s pretty good , when i haven t eaten for twenty - four hours! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he added aloud ,  - yes , sir , i am hungryvery hungry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and your excellency wants something to eat? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at once , if possible<s> <s>  - nothing easier , said peppino . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here you can get anything you want; by paying for it , of course , as among honest folk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is not the custom , excellency , said peppino . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me have some dinner! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what would your excellency like? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and peppino placed his pan on the ground , so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give your orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you kitchens here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - kitchens? of coursecomplete ones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and cooks? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - excellent! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , a fowl , fish , game ,it signifies little , so that i eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you mentioned a fowl , i think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , a fowl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino , turning around , shouted ,  - a fowl for his excellency! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i could almost believe myself at the caf de paris , murmured danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars asked for a knife and fork . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here , excellency , said peppino , offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pardon me , excellency , said peppino , placing his hand on the banker s shoulder;  - people pay here before they eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they might not be satisfied , and<s> <s>  - ah , ha , thought danglars ,  - this is not so much like paris , except that i shall probably be skinned! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never mind , i ll fix that all right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have always heard how cheap poultry is in italy; i should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at rome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>there , he said , throwing a louis down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino picked up the louis , and danglars again prepared to carve the fowl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stay a moment , your excellency , said peppino , rising;  - you still owe me something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i said they would skin me , thought danglars; but resolving to resist the extortion , he said ,  - come , how much do i owe you for this fowl? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency has given me a louis on account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a louis on account for a fowl? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very droll , he muttered ,  - very droll indeed , and he again began to carve the fowl , when peppino stopped the baron s right hand with his left , and held out his other hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , now , he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it not a joke? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we never joke , replied peppino , solemn as a quaker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a hundred thousand francs for a fowl! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , excellency , you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , come , this is very drollvery amusingi allow; but , as i am very hungry , pray allow me to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stay , here is another louis for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then that will make only 4 ,998 louis more , said peppino with the same indifference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you do not know with whom you have to deal! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars threw himself upon his goat - skin , and peppino , reclosing the door , again began eating his peas and bacon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was certainly eating , and noisily too , like an ill - bred man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - brute! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino pretended not to hear him , and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he again arose and went to the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , your excellency , it is you who should tell us what you want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give your orders , and we will execute them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then open the door directly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peppino obeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now look here , i want something to eat! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to eatdo you hear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , you understand me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what would your excellency like to eat? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a piece of dry bread , since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bread? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> holloa , there , some bread! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he called . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - four thousand nine hundred and ninety - eight louis , said peppino;  - you have paid two louis in advance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one hundred thousand francs for a loaf? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one hundred thousand francs , repeated peppino . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you only asked 100 ,000 francs for a fowl! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it signifies nothing whether you eat much or littlewhether you have ten dishes or oneit is always the same price . </s> </s>

<s> <s> my dear fellow , it is perfectly ridiculousstupid! </s> </s>

<s> <s> pay and eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what am i to pay with , brute? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your excellency has 5 ,050 ,000 francs in your pocket; that will be fifty fowls at 100 ,000 francs apiece , and half a fowl for the 50 ,000 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars shuddered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bandage fell from his eyes , and he understood the joke , which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , he said ,  - if i pay you the 100 ,000 francs , will you be satisfied , and allow me to eat at my ease? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , said peppino . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thomson & french , via dei banchi , rome; give me a draft for 4 ,998 louis on these gentlemen , and our banker shall take it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace , so he took the pen , ink , and paper peppino offered him , wrote the draft , and signed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here , he said ,  - here is a draft at sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for peppino , he examined the paper attentively , put it into his pocket , and continued eating his peas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day danglars was again hungry; certainly the air of that dungeon was very provocative of appetite . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day , for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his cell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty; he had forgotten that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth; then , no longer able to resist , he called out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sentinel opened the door; it was a new face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance , so he sent for peppino . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here i am , your excellency , said peppino , with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you want? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - something to drink . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then give me water , cried danglars , endeavoring to parry the blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , water is even more scarce than wine , your excellency ,there has been such a drought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke , he felt his temples get moist with perspiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , my friend , said danglars , seeing that he made no impression on peppino ,  - you will not refuse me a glass of wine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have already told you that we do not sell at retail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they are all the same price . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what is that? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the person to whom you were conducted yesterday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the next moment luigi vampa appeared before danglars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you sent for me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you , sir , the chief of the people who brought me here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , your excellency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - merely the 5 ,000 ,000 you have about you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you deprive me of that , take away my life also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we are forbidden to shed your blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and by whom are you forbidden? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you do , then , obey someone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , a chief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thought you said you were the chief? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so i am of these men; but there is another over me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and did your superior order you to treat me in this way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - probably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will give them to you on condition that you let me go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why do you offer me 4 ,000 ,000 for what is worth 5 ,000 ,000? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is a kind of usury , banker , that i do not understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take all , thentake all , i tell you , and kill me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , come , calm yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will excite your blood , and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but when i have no more money left to pay you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you must suffer hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said danglars , becoming pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - most likely , replied vampa coolly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and yet you will let me perish with hunger? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , that is a different thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you may torture , torment , kill me , but you shall not have my signature again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars , raving , threw himself on the goat - skin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who was the invisible chief? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what could be his intentions towards him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and why , when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed , might he not also be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , yes; certainly a speedy , violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies , who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the first time in his life , danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire; the time had come when the implacable spectre , which exists in the mind of every human creature , arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart ,  - thou shalt die! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase; first it flies , then despairs , and at last , by the very force of desperation , sometimes succeeds in eluding its pursuers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars meditated an escape; but the walls were solid rock , a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell , and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer , but to have everything he wanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then a strange reaction took place; he who had just abandoned 5 ,000 ,000 endeavored to save the 50 ,000 francs he had left , and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privationhe was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> three days passed thus , during which his prayers were frequent , if not heartfelt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes he was delirious , and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet; he , also , was dying of hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the fourth , he was no longer a man , but a living corpse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he entreated peppino , as he would a guardian angel , to give him food; he offered him 1 ,000 francs for a mouthful of bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but peppino did not answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he murmured , and fell with his face to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then rising in despair , he exclaimed ,  - the chief , the chief! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here i am , said vampa , instantly appearing;  - what do you want? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take my last gold , muttered danglars , holding out his pocket - book ,  - and let me live here; i ask no more for libertyi only ask to live! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you suffer a great deal? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not think so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; those who have died of hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he struck his forehead on the ground and groaned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , he said ,  - there have been some who have suffered more than i have , but then they must have been martyrs at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you repent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked a deep , solemn voice , which caused danglars  hair to stand on end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects , and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak , half lost in the shadow of a stone column . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of what must i repent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of the evil you have done , said the voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i forgive you , said the man , dropping his cloak , and advancing to the light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the count of monte cristo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are mistakeni am not the count of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then who are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars uttered a cry , and fell prostrate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - rise , said the count ,  - your life is safe; the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplicesone is mad , the other dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the 5 ,000 ,000 you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now eat and drink; i will entertain you tonight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vampa , when this man is satisfied , let him be free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew; when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow , before which the bandits bowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> according to the count s directions , danglars was waited on by vampa , who brought him the best wine and fruits of italy; then , having conducted him to the road , and pointed to the post - chaise , left him leaning against a tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained there all night , not knowing where he was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream; he was thirsty , and dragged himself towards it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he stooped down to drink , he saw that his hair had become entirely white . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was about six o clock in the evening; an opal - colored light , through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays , descended on the blue ocean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the heat of the day had gradually decreased , and a light breeze arose , seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the mediterranean , and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants , mingled with the fresh smell of the sea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a light yacht , chaste and elegant in its form , was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake , extending from gibraltar to the dardanelles , and from tunis to venice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind , gliding on the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it advanced swiftly and gracefully , leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon; but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology , its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave , as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite , who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the yacht moved rapidly on , though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> standing on the prow was a tall man , of a dark complexion , who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone , which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is that monte cristo? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we have reached it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable sadness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he added , in a low tone ,  - yes; that is the haven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then he again plunged into a train of thought , the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile , than it would have been by tears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a few minutes afterwards a flash of light , which was extinguished instantly , was seen on the land , and the sound of firearms reached the yacht . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what signal? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give it to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the captain gave him a loaded carbine; the traveller slowly raised it , and fired in the air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ten minutes afterwards , the sails were furled , and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gig was already lowered , and in it were four oarsmen and a coxswain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the traveller descended , and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat , which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation , stood up with his arms crossed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rowers waited , their oars half lifted out of the water , like birds drying their wings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give way , said the traveller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water , and the boat , yielding to the impulsion , glided forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference , and stepped out of the boat; the sea immediately rose to his waist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , your excellency , murmured the pilot ,  - you should not have done so; our master will scold us for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young man continued to advance , following the sailors , who chose a firm footing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thirty strides brought them to dry land; the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet , and looked around for someone to show him his road , for it was quite dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - evening , maximilian; you are punctual , thank you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , is it you , count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the young man , in an almost joyful accent , pressing monte cristo s hand with both his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but you are dripping , my dear fellow; you must change your clothes , as calypso said to telemachus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , i have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , said the count ,  - you are looking for the sailors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have made a bargain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel looked at the count with surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , he said ,  - you are not the same here as in paris . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here you laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , how charitable , kind , and good you are; you affect this gayety to inspire me with courage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; for as the gladiator said to the emperor , when he entered the arena , he who is about to die salutes you . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - then you are not consoled? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the count , surprised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , exclaimed morrel , with a glance full of bitter reproach ,  - do you think it possible that i could be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - listen , said the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you understand the meaning of my words? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you cannot take me for a commonplace man , a mere rattle , emitting a vague and senseless noise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i ask you if you are consoled , i speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death; or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , my dear friend , if this be the case ,if you can no longer weep , if your frozen heart be dead , if you put all your trust in god , then , maximilian , you are consoleddo not complain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , said morrel , in a firm and at the same time soft voice ,  - listen to me , as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven , though he remains on earth; i come to die in the arms of a friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> certainly , there are people whom i love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i love my sister julie ,i love her husband emmanuel; but i require a strong mind to smile on my last moments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting; i could not bear to see her suffer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand , and alarm the house with his cries . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you , count , who are more than mortal , will , i am sure , lead me to death by a pleasant path , will you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , indeed ,i am calm , said morrel , giving his hand to the count;  - my pulse does not beat slower or faster than usual . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , i feel that i have reached the goal , and i will go no farther . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you told me to wait and hope; do you know what you did , unfortunate adviser? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i did hope ( man is a poor wretched creature ) , i did hope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , i did waityes , i did hope , count , and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together , you have unconsciously wounded , tortured my heart , for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , count , i shall sleep calmly , deliciously in the arms of death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my friend , continued morrel ,  - you named the fifth of october as the end of the period of waiting ,today is the fifth of october , he took out his watch ,  - it is now nine o clock ,i have yet three hours to live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be it so , said the count ,  - come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel mechanically followed the count , and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel hesitated to advance; he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo drew him in gently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life , like those ancient romans , who when condemned by nero , their emperor and heir , sat down at a table covered with flowers , and gently glided into death , amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as you please , he said;  - death is always death ,that is forgetfulness , repose , exclusion from life , and therefore from grief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sat down , and monte cristo placed himself opposite to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel had looked carelessly around , and had probably noticed nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us talk like men , he said , looking at the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , said morrel ,  - you are the epitome of all human knowledge , and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than ours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is something true in what you say , said the count , with that smile which made him so handsome;  - i have descended from a planet called grief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning; for instance , you told me to live , and i did live; you told me to hope , and i almost did so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am almost inclined to ask you , as though you had experienced death , is it painful to die?  <s> <s> monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , he said ,  - yes , doubtless it is painful , if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death , as well as in life; the only thing is to understand it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some day , when the world is much older , and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature , to serve for the general good of humanity; when mankind , as you were just saying , have discovered the secrets of death , then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and if you wished to die , you would choose this death , count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now i understand , he said ,  - why you had me brought here to this desolate spot , in the midst of the ocean , to this subterranean palace; it was because you loved me , was it not , count? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , you have guessed rightly , morrel , said the count ,  - that is what i intended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thanks; the idea that tomorrow i shall no longer suffer , is sweet to my heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you then regret nothing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel s clear eye was for the moment clouded , then it shone with unusual lustre , and a large tear rolled down his cheek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what , said the count ,  - do you still regret anything in the world , and yet die? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count fancied that he was yielding , and this belief revived the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the chteau d if . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am endeavoring , he thought ,  - to make this man happy; i look upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil i have wrought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , supposing i am deceived , supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas , what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he said aloud:  - listen , morrel , i see your grief is great , but still you do not like to risk your soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel smiled sadly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , he said ,  - i swear to you my soul is no longer my own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , i possess nearly a hundred millions and i give them to you; with such a fortune you can attain every wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you ambitious? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> overturn the world , change its character , yield to mad ideas , be even criminalbut live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - count , i have your word , said morrel coldly; then taking out his watch , he added ,  - it is half - past eleven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - morrel , can you intend it in my house , under my very eyes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is well , said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words;  - you wish ityou are inflexible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , as you said , you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel obeyed; the count arose , and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain , took from it a little silver casket , beautifully carved and chased , the corners of which represented four bending figures , similar to the caryatides , the forms of women , symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he placed the casket on the table; then opening it took out a little golden box , the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this box contained an unctuous substance partly solid , of which it was impossible to discover the color , owing to the reflection of the polished gold , sapphires , rubies , emeralds , which ornamented the box . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a mixed mass of blue , red , and gold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon , and offered it to morrel , fixing a long steadfast glance upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was then observable that the substance was greenish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thank you from the depths of my heart , said the young man , taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel , arresting his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , the fact is , morrel , i was thinking that i too am weary of life , and since an opportunity presents itself<s> <s>  - stay! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in your case it would be a crime . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> adieu , my noble and generous friend , adieu; i will go and tell valentine what you have done for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and slowly , though without any hesitation , only waiting to press the count s hand fervently , he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then they were both silent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ali , mute and attentive , brought the pipes and coffee , and disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by degrees , the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them , and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seated opposite to him , monte cristo watched him in the shadow , and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an overpowering sadness took possession of the young man , his hands relaxed their hold , the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color , and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then it appeared to him that monte cristo smiled , not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart , but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time the count appeared to increase in stature , his form , nearly double its usual height , stood out in relief against the red tapestry , his black hair was thrown back , and he stood in the attitude of an avenging angel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel , overpowered , turned around in the armchair; a delicious torpor permeated every vein . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> enervated , prostrate , and breathless , he became unconscious of outward objects; he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wished to articulate a last farewell , but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat , like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> involuntarily his languid eyes closed , and still through his eyelashes a well - known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> immediately a brilliant light from the next room , or rather from the palace adjoining , shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pale , and sweetly smiling , she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it heaven that opens before me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thought the dying man;  - that angel resembles the one i have lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - valentine , valentine! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he mentally ejaculated; but his lips uttered no sound , and as though all his strength were centred in that internal emotion , he sighed and closed his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine rushed towards him; his lips again moved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is calling you , said the count;  - he to whom you have confided your destinyhe from whom death would have separated you , calls you to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> happily , i vanquished death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine seized the count s hand , and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the count;  - tell me till you are weary , that i have restored you to happiness; you do not know how much i require this assurance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , yes , i thank you with all my heart , said valentine;  - and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude , oh , then , ask hayde! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ask my beloved sister hayde , who ever since our departure from france , has caused me to wait patiently for this happy day , while talking to me of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monte cristo with an emotion he in vain endeavored to dissimulate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , with all my soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , am i happy enough for that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; you have called hayde your sister ,let her become so indeed , valentine; render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me; protect her , for ( the count s voice was thick with emotion )  - henceforth she will be alone in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - alone in the world! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monte cristo turned around; hayde was standing pale , motionless , looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because tomorrow , hayde , you will be free; you will then assume your proper position in society , for i will not allow my destiny to overshadow yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> daughter of a prince , i restore to you the riches and name of your father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hayde , hayde , you are young and beautiful; forget even my name , and be happy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , heavens , exclaimed valentine , who was supporting the head of morrel on her shoulder ,  - do you not see how pale she is? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you not see how she suffers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is my master , and i am his slave; he has the right to notice nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , heavens , exclaimed monte cristo ,  - can my suspicions be correct? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am young , gently replied hayde;  - i love the life you have made so sweet to me , and i should be sorry to die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you then love me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> valentine , tell him if you love maximilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count felt his heart dilate and throb; he opened his arms , and hayde , uttering a cry , sprang into them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , she cried ,  - i do love you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i love you as my life , for you are the best , the noblest of created beings! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let it be , then , as you wish , sweet angel; god has sustained me in my struggle with my enemies , and has given me this reward; he will not let me end my triumph in suffering; i wished to punish myself , but he has pardoned me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean , my lord? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years of slow experience; i have but you in the world , hayde; through you i again take hold on life , through you i shall suffer , through you rejoice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you hear him , valentine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the count withdrew for a moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have i discovered the truth? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said;  - but whether it be for recompense or punishment , i accept my fate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come , hayde , come! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and throwing his arm around the young girl s waist , he pressed the hand of valentine , and disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , he cried , in an accent of despair ,  - the count has deceived me; i am yet living; and extending his hand towards the table , he seized a knife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dearest , exclaimed valentine , with her adorable smile ,  - awake , and look at me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel uttered a loud exclamation , and frantic , doubtful , dazzled , as though by a celestial vision , he fell upon his knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had found the door of the grotto opened , and gone forth; on the azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks , apparently awaiting a sign from them to advance , and pointed him out to valentine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you wish to speak to us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked morrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from the count! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured the two young people . </s> </s>

<s> <s> morrel opened the letter , and read: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear maximilian ,<s> <s>  - there is a felucca for you at anchor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you; for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father , now a madman , and her brother who died last september with his mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny , morrel , to pray sometimes for a man , who , like satan , thought himself for an instant equal to god , but who now acknowledges with christian humility that god alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for you , morrel , this is the secret of my conduct towards you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another , nothing more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we must have felt what it is to die , morrel , that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - live , then , and be happy , beloved children of my heart , and never forget that until the day when god shall deign to reveal the future to man , all human wisdom is summed up in these two words ,wait and hope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your friend ,<s> <s>  - edmond dants , count of monte cristo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> during the perusal of this letter , which informed valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother , she became pale , a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom , and tears , not the less painful because they were silent , ran down her cheeks; her happiness cost her very dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrel looked around uneasily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , he said ,  - the count s generosity is too overwhelming; valentine will be satisfied with my humble fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where is the count , friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lead me to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where is the count? where is hayde? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said jacopo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor , and on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea , they perceived a large white sail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gone , murmured valentine;  - adieu , my sweet haydeadieu , my sister! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who can say whether we shall ever see them again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said morrel with tearful eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait and hope ( fac et spera )!
