<s> <s> although i am not disposed to maintain that being born in a workhouse , is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being , i do mean to say that in this particular instance , it was the best thing for oliver twist that could by possibility have occurred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fact is , that there was considerable difficulty in inducing oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration ,a troublesome practice , but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress , rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , if , during this brief period , oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers , anxious aunts , experienced nurses , and doctors of profound wisdom , he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you must not talk about dying yet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> interposed the nurse , hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle , the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the patient shook her head , and stretched out her hand towards the child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they talked of hope and comfort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had been strangers too long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s all over , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thingummy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , poor dear , so it is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the nurse , picking up the cork of the green bottle , which had fallen out on the pillow , as she stooped to take up the child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you needn t mind sending up to me , if the child cries , nurse , said the surgeon , putting on his gloves with great deliberation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s very likely it will be troublesome . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she was brought here last night , replied the old woman ,  - by the overseer s order . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was found lying in the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had walked some distance , for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from , or where she was going to , nobody knows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the surgeon leaned over the body , and raised the left hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the old story , he said , shaking his head:  - no wedding - ring , i see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse , having once more applied herself to the green bottle , sat down on a low chair before the fire , and proceeded to dress the infant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what an excellent example of the power of dress , young oliver twist was! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering , he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society . </s> </s>

<s> <s> for the next eight or ten months , oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities , whether there was no female then domiciled in  - the house who was in a situation to impart to oliver twist , the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the workhouse authorities replied with humility , that there was not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon this , the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved , that oliver should be  - farmed , or , in other words , that he should be dispatched to a branch - workhouse some three miles off , where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor - laws , rolled about the floor all day , without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing , under the parental superintendence of an elderly female , who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence - halfpenny per small head per week . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sevenpence - halfpenny s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence - halfpenny , quite enough to overload its stomach , and make it uncomfortable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating , and who demonstrated it so well , that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day , and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all , if he had not died , four - and - twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care oliver twist was delivered over , a similar result usually attended the operation of her system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food , it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten , either that it sickened from want and cold , or fell into the fire from neglect , or got half - smothered by accident; in any one of which cases , the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world , and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> occasionally , when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead , or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washingthough the latter accident was very scarce , anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farmthe jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions , or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon , and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside ( which was very probable indeed ) , and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self - devotional . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm , and always sent the beadle the day before , to say they were going . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the children were neat and clean to behold , when they went; and what more would the people have! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver twist s ninth birthday found him a pale thin child , somewhat diminutive in stature , and decidedly small in circumference . </s> </s>

<s> <s> oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness , when , glancing upward , he caught sight of mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mann , who had got behind the beadle s chair , and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance . </s> </s>

<s> <s> inquired poor oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , she can t , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was no very great consolation to the child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hunger and recent ill - usage are great assistants if you want to cry; and oliver cried very naturally indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mann gave him a thousand embraces , and what oliver wanted a great deal more , a piece of bread and butter , lest he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the slice of bread in his hand , and the little brown - cloth parish cap on his head , oliver was then led away by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind , they were the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world , sank into the child s heart for the first time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to these interrogations mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for the temporary blandness which gin - and - water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour , and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread , when mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , who had handed him over to the care of an old woman , returned; and , telling him it was a board night , informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had no time to think about the matter , however; for mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble gave him a tap on the head , with his cane , to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively: and bidding him to follow , conducted him into a large white - washed room , where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bow to the board , said bumble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table , fortunately bowed to that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the gentleman in the high chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> which was a capital way of raising his spirits , and putting him quite at his ease . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s that , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the gentleman who had spoken first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , replied oliver , weeping bitterly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what are you crying for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and to be sure it was very extraordinary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope you say your prayers every night , said another gentleman in a gruff voice;  - and pray for the people who feed you , and take care of youlike a christian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , stammered the boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would have been very like a christian , and a marvellously good christian too , if oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he hadn t , because nobody had taught him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have come here to be educated , and taught a useful trade , said the red - faced gentleman in the high chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so you ll begin to pick oakum tomorrow morning at six o clock , added the surly one in the white waistcoat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum , oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle , and was then hurried away to a large ward; where , on a rough , hard bed , he sobbed himself to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a novel illustration of the tender laws of england! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they let the paupers go to sleep! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor oliver! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he little thought , as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him , that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and this was it: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the members of this board were very sage , deep , philosophical men; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse , they found out at once , what ordinary folks would never have discoveredthe poor people liked it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oho! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this view , they contracted with the water - works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a corn - factory to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day , with an onion twice a week , and half a roll of sundays . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they made a great many other wise and humane regulations , having reference to the ladies , which it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people , in consequence of the great expense of a suit in doctors  commons; and , instead of compelling a man to support his family , as they had theretofore done , took his family away from him , and made him a bachelor! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no saying how many applicants for relief , under these last two heads , might have started up in all classes of society , if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were long - headed men , and had provided for this difficulty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the first six months after oliver twist was removed , the system was in full operation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was rather expensive at first , in consequence of the increase in the undertaker s bill , and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers , which fluttered loosely on their wasted , shrunken forms , after a week or two s gruel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bowls never wanted washing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this operation ( which never took very long , the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls ) , they would sit staring at the copper , with such eager eyes , as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed; employing themselves , meanwhile , in sucking their fingers most assiduously , with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had a wild , hungry eye; and they implicitly believed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening , and ask for more; and it fell to oliver twist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the evening arrived; the boys took their places . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> child as he was , he was desperate with hunger , and reckless with misery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he rose from the table; and advancing to the master , basin and spoon in hand , said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the master was a fat , healthy man; but he turned very pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds , and then clung for support to the copper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the master at length , in a faint voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the board were sitting in solemn conclave , when mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> limbkins , i beg your pardon , sir! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver twist has asked for more! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a general start . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> horror was depicted on every countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> limbkins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - compose yourself , bumble , and answer me distinctly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that boy will be hung , said the gentleman in the white waistcoat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know that boy will be hung . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate , offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take oliver twist off the hands of the parish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in other words , five pounds and oliver twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade , business , or calling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never was more convinced of anything in my life , said the gentleman in the white waistcoat , as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning:  - i never was more convinced of anything in my life , than i am that that boy will come to be hung . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as i purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not , i should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative ( supposing it to possess any at all ) , if i ventured to hint just yet , whether the life of oliver twist had this violent termination or no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more , oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it appears , at first sight not unreasonable to suppose , that , if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat , he would have established that sage individual s prophetic character , once and for ever , by tying one end of his pocket - handkerchief to a hook in the wall , and attaching himself to the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to the performance of this feat , however , there was one obstacle: namely , that pocket - handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury , had been , for all future times and ages , removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board , in council assembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a still greater obstacle in oliver s youth and childishness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he only cried bitterly all day; and , when the long , dismal night came on , spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness , and crouching in the corner , tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble , and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall , as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for exercise , it was nice cold weather , and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump , in a stone yard , in the presence of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , who prevented his catching cold , and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame , by repeated applications of the cane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for society , he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined , and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation , he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer - time , and there permitted to listen to , and console his mind with , a general supplication of the boys , containing a special clause , therein inserted by authority of the board , in which they entreated to be made good , virtuous , contented , and obedient , and to be guarded from the sins and vices of oliver twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness , and an article direct from the manufactory of the very devil himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it chanced one morning , while oliver s affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state , that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gamfield , chimney - sweep , went his way down the high street , deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent , for which his landlord had become rather pressing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gamfield s most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount; and , in a species of arithmetical desperation , he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey , when passing the workhouse , his eyes encountered the bill on the gate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - woo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering , probably , whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage - stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so , without noticing the word of command , he jogged onward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally , but more particularly on his eyes; and , running after him , bestowed a blow on his head , which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , catching hold of the bridle , he gave his jaw a sharp wrench , by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and by these means turned him round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having completed these arrangements , he walked up to the gate , to read the bill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him , after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board - room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having witnessed the little dispute between mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gamfield and the donkey , he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill , for he saw at once that mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> gamfield , knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was , well knew he would be a nice small pattern , just the very thing for register stoves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , he spelt the bill through again , from beginning to end; and then , touching his fur cap in token of humility , accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gamfield . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ay , my man , said the gentleman in the white waistcoat , with a condescending smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what of him? </s> </s>

<s> <s> gamfield ,  - i wants a  prentis , and i am ready to take him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gamfield having lingered behind , to give the donkey another blow on the head , and another wrench of the jaw , as a caution not to run away in his absence , followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where oliver had first seen him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make  em come down again , said gamfield;  - that s all smoke , and no blaze; vereas smoke ain t o  no use at all in making a boy come down , for it only sinds him to sleep , and that s wot he likes . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> in pursuance of this determination , little oliver , to his excessive astonishment , was released from bondage , and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bumble , somewhat less pompously , for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced;  - come , oliver! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket , and don t cry into your gruel; that s a very foolish action , oliver . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bumble to stay there , until he came back to fetch him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there the boy remained , with a palpitating heart , for half an hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble thrust in his head , unadorned with the cocked hat , and said aloud: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , oliver , my dear , come to the gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble said this , he put on a grim and threatening look , and added , in a low voice ,  - mind what i told you , you young rascal! </s> </s>

<s> <s> that same evening , the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed , not only that oliver would be hung , but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bumble , said the undertaker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you ll make your fortune , mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bumble , tapping the undertaker on the shoulder , in a friendly manner , with his cane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - think so? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the prices allowed by the board are very small , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be; and laughed a long time without cessation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , he said at length ,  - there s no denying that , since the new system of feeding has come in , the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit , mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> a fair profit is , of course , allowable . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just so , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - though i must say , continued the undertaker , resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted:  - though i must say , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , that i have to contend against one very great disadvantage: which is , that all the stout people go off the quickest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the people who have been better off , and have paid rates for many years , are the first to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sowerberry said this , with the becoming indignation of an ill - used man; and as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver twist being uppermost in his mind , he made him his theme . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the bye , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a porochial  prentis , who is at present a dead - weight; a millstone , as i may say , round the porochial throat? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sowerberry , liberal terms? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble spoke , he raised his cane to the bill above him , and gave three distinct raps upon the words  - five pounds: which were printed thereon in roman capitals of gigantic size . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gadso! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the undertaker: taking mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - if the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk , they d have enough to do . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - juries , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they haven t no more philosophy nor political economy about  em than that , said the beadle , snapping his fingers contemptuously . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - let  em alone for that , replied the undertaker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , he smiled , approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and , turning to the undertaker , said in a calmer voice: </s> </s>

<s> <s> oliver made a bow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s>

<s> <s> sowerberry , will you have the goodness to come here a moment , my dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop , and presented the form of a short , thin , squeezed - up woman , with a vixenish countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver bowed again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the undertaker s wife ,  - he s very small . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , he is rather small , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble: looking at oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger;  - he is small . </s> </s>

<s> <s> with this , the undertaker s wife opened a side door , and pushed oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell , damp and dark: forming the ante - room to the coal - cellar , and denominated  - kitchen; wherein sat a slatternly girl , in shoes down at heel , and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sowerberry , who had followed oliver down ,  - give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for trip . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver , whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat , and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it , replied in the negative; and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wish some well - fed philosopher , whose meat and drink turn to gall within him; whose blood is ice , whose heart is iron; could have seen oliver twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected . </s> </s>

<s> <s> there is only one thing i should like better; and that would be to see the philosopher making the same sort of meal himself , with the same relish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the undertaker s wife , when oliver had finished his supper: which she had regarded in silent horror , and with fearful auguries of his future appetite:  - have you done? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there being nothing eatable within his reach , oliver replied in the affirmative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then come with me , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty lamp , and leading the way upstairs;  - your bed s under the counter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver lingered no longer , but meekly followed his new mistress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> against the wall were ranged , in regular array , a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light , like high - shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets . </s> </s>

<s> <s> nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed oliver . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the boy had no friends to care for , or to care for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but his heart was heavy , notwithstanding; and he wished , as he crept into his narrow bed , that that were his coffin , and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground , with the tall grass waving gently above his head , and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver was awakened in the morning , by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop - door: which , before he could huddle on his clothes , was repeated , in an angry and impetuous manner , about twenty - five times . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - open the door , will yer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i suppose yer the new boy , ain t yer? </s> </s>

<s> <s> oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference , to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice , whoever he might be , would redeem his pledge , most honourably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a second or two , oliver glanced up the street , and down the street , and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown , who had addressed him through the key - hole , had walked a few paces off , to warm himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity - boy , sitting on a post in front of the house , eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut into wedges , the size of his mouth , with a clasp - knife , and then consumed with great dexterity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i beg your pardon , sir , said oliver at length: seeing that no other visitor made his appearance;  - did you knock? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i kicked , replied the charity - boy . </s> </s>

<s> <s> inquired oliver , innocently . </s> </s>

<s> <s> they walked on , for some time , through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town; and then , striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through , paused to look for the house which was the object of their search . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the houses on either side were high and large , but very old , and tenanted by people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted , without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who , with folded arms and bodies half doubled , occasionally skulked along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a great many of the tenements had shop - fronts; but these were fast closed , and mouldering away; only the upper rooms being inhabited . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some houses which had become insecure from age and decay , were prevented from falling into the street , by huge beams of wood reared against the walls , and firmly planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches , for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window , were wrenched from their positions , to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the kennel was stagnant and filthy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the very rats , which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness , were hideous with famine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was neither knocker nor bell - handle at the open door where oliver and his master stopped; so , groping his way cautiously through the dark passage , and bidding oliver keep close to him and not be afraid , the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stumbling against a door on the landing , he rapped at it with his knuckles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained , to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stepped in; oliver followed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place , and crept involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up , the boy felt that it was a corpse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly; his eyes were bloodshot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> damn you , keep back , if you ve a life to lose! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nonsense , my good man , said the undertaker , who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nonsense! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she couldn t rest there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape from his pocket , knelt down for a moment by the side of the body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the man: bursting into tears , and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman;  - kneel down , kneel downkneel round her , every one of you , and mark my words! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say she was starved to death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never knew how bad she was , till the fever came upon her; and then her bones were starting through the skin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she couldn t even see her children s faces , though we heard her gasping out their names . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i begged for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i came back , she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up , for they starved her to death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they starved her! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he twined his hands in his hair; and , with a loud scream , rolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed , and the foam covering his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman , who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed , menaced them into silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she was my daughter , said the old woman , nodding her head in the direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer , more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lord , lord! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , it is strange that i who gave birth to her , and was a woman then , should be alive and merry now , and she lying there: so cold and stiff! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stop , stop! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the old woman in a loud whisper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will she be buried tomorrow , or next day , or tonight? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i laid her out; and i must walk , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we should have cake and wine , too , before we go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall we have some bread , dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , said the undertaker ,  - of course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day , ( the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half - quartern loaf and a piece of cheese , left with them by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble himself , ) oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin having been screwed down , was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers , and carried into the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , you must put your best leg foremost , old lady! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus directed , the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the two mourners kept as near them , as they could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble and sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and oliver , whose legs were not so long as his master s , ran by the side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was not so great a necessity for hurrying as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , after a lapse of something more than an hour , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble then thrashed a boy or two , to keep up appearances; and the reverend gentleman , having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes , gave his surplice to the clerk , and walked away again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , bill! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was no very difficult task , for the grave was so full , that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the grave - digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet: shouldered his spade; and walked off , followed by the boys , who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said bumble , tapping the man on the back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak ( which the undertaker had taken off ) , to pay him any attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came to , saw him safely out of the churchyard , locked the gate , and departed on their different ways . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , oliver , said sowerberry , as they walked home ,  - how do you like it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pretty well , thank you , sir replied oliver , with considerable hesitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not very much , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , you ll get used to it in time , oliver , said sowerberry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver wondered , in his own mind , whether it had taken a very long time to get mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sowerberry used to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he thought it better not to ask the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had seen and heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the month s trial over , oliver was formally apprenticed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a nice sickly season just at this time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in commercial phrase , coffins were looking up; and , in the course of a few weeks , oliver acquired a great deal of experience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the success of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent , or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful processions which little oliver headed , in a hat - band reaching down to his knees , to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too , in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker , he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong - minded people bear their trials and losses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for instance; when sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman , who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces , who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness , and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions , they would be as happy among themselves as need bequite cheerful and contentedconversing together with as much freedom and gaiety , as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> husbands , too , bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wives , again , put on weeds for their husbands , as if , so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow , they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was observable , too , that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment , recovered almost as soon as they reached home , and became quite composed before the tea - drinking was over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this was very pleasant and improving to see; and oliver beheld it with great admiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charlotte treated him ill , because noah did; and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sowerberry was his decided enemy , because mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one day , oliver and noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner - hour , to banquet upon a small joint of muttona pound and a half of the worst end of the neck; when charlotte being called out of the way , there ensued a brief interval of time , which noah claypole , being hungry and vicious , considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young oliver twist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> intent upon this innocent amusement , noah put his feet on the table - cloth; and pulled oliver s hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his opinion that he was a  - sneak; and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged , whenever that desirable event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance , like a malicious and ill - conditioned charity - boy as he was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , making oliver cry , noah attempted to be more facetious still; and in his attempt , did what many sometimes do to this day , when they want to be funny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he got rather personal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - work us , said noah ,  - how s your mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> under this impression he returned to the charge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what did she die of , work us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said noah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of a broken heart , some of our old nurses told me , replied oliver: more as if he were talking to himself , than answering noah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think i know what it must be to die of that! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tol de rol lol lol , right fol lairy , work us , said noah , as a tear rolled down oliver s cheek . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s set you a snivelling now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there; that s enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t say anything more to me about her; you d better not! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed noah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> better not! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> work us , don t be impudent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your mother , too! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , lor! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yer know , work us , continued noah , emboldened by oliver s silence , and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most annoying:  - yer know , work us , it can t be helped now; and of course yer couldn t help it then; and i am very sorry for it; and i m sure we all are , and pity yer very much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a regular right - down bad  un , work us , replied noah , coolly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> crimson with fury , oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table; seized noah by the throat; shook him , in the violence of his rage , till his teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow , felled him to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a minute ago , the boy had looked the quiet child , mild , dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but his spirit was roused at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person changed , as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an energy he had never known before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> blubbered noah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - charlotte! </s> </s>

<s> <s> charlotte! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noah s shouts were responded to , by a loud scream from charlotte , and a louder from mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> screamed charlotte: seizing oliver with her utmost force , which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , you little un - grate - ful , mur - de - rous , hor - rid villain! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and between every syllable , charlotte gave oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream , for the benefit of society . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charlotte s fist was by no means a light one; but , lest it should not be effectual in calming oliver s wrath , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sowerberry plunged into the kitchen , and assisted to hold him with one hand , while she scratched his face with the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was rather too violent exercise to last long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they were all wearied out , and could tear and beat no longer , they dragged oliver , struggling and shouting , but nothing daunted , into the dust - cellar , and there locked him up . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - your master s not at home; there s not a man in the house , and he ll kick that door down in ten minutes . </s> </s>

<s> <s> for the rest of the day , he was shut up in the back kitchen , in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sowerberry , after making various remarks outside the door , by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother , looked into the room , and , amidst the jeers and pointings of noah and charlotte , ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but now , when there were none to see or hear him , he fell upon his knees on the floor; and , hiding his face in his hands , wept such tears as , god send for the credit of our nature , few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a long time , oliver remained motionless in this attitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having gazed cautiously round him , and listened intently , he gently undid the fastenings of the door , and looked abroad . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the stars seemed , to the boy s eyes , farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground , looked sepulchral and death - like , from being so still . </s> </s>

<s> <s> oliver stopped , and peeped into the garden . </s> </s>

<s> <s> said oliver , as the boy ran to the gate , and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is any one up? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nobody but me , replied the child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you musn t say you saw me , dick , said oliver . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i don t know where . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how pale you are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i heard the doctor tell them i was dying , replied the child with a faint smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am very glad to see you , dear; but don t stop , don t stop! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , i will , to say good - b ye to you , replied oliver . </s> </s>

<s> <s> kiss me , said the child , climbing up the low gate , and flinging his little arms round oliver s neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - b ye , dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver reached the stile at which the by - path terminated; and once more gained the high - road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone , and began to think , for the first time , where he had better go and try to live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy s mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumblecould ever find him there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had often heard the old men in the workhouse , too , say that no lad of spirit need want in london; and that there were ways of living in that vast city , which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the very place for a homeless boy , who must die in the streets unless some one helped him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as these things passed through his thoughts , he jumped upon his feet , and again walked forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had diminished the distance between himself and london by full four miles more , before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as this consideration forced itself upon him , he slackened his pace a little , and meditated upon his means of getting there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had a crust of bread , a coarse shirt , and two pairs of stockings , in his bundle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had a penny tooa gift of sowerberry s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily wellin his pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a clean shirt , thought oliver ,  - is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty - five miles  walk in winter time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but oliver s thoughts , like those of most other people , although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties , were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so , after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose , he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder , and trudged on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread , and a few draughts of water , which he begged at the cottage - doors by the road - side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the night came , he turned into a meadow; and , creeping close under a hay - rick , determined to lie there , till morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> being very tired with his walk , however , he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had walked no more than twelve miles , when night closed in again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his feet were sore , and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another night passed in the bleak damp air , made him worse; when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage - coach came up , and then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill , and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way , but was unable to do it , by reason of his fatigue and sore feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in some villages , large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons who begged within the district , that they would be sent to jail . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this frightened oliver very much , and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in others , he would stand about the inn - yards , and look mournfully at every one who passed: a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady s ordering one of the post - boys who were lounging about , to drive that strange boy out of the place , for she was sure he had come to steal something . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he begged at a farmer s house , ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop , they talked about the beadlewhich brought oliver s heart into his mouth ,very often the only thing he had there , for many hours together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact , if it had not been for a good - hearted turnpike - man , and a benevolent old lady , oliver s troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mother s; in other words , he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king s highway . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the turnpike - man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady , who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth , took pity upon the poor orphan , and gave him what little she could affordand morewith such kind and gentle words , and such tears of sympathy and compassion , that they sank deeper into oliver s soul , than all the sufferings he had ever undergone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place , oliver limped slowly into the little town of barnet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation , as he sat , with bleeding feet and covered with dust , upon a door - step . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by degrees , the shutters were opened; the window - blinds were drawn up; and people began passing to and fro . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had no heart to beg . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and there he sat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great number of public - houses ( every other house in barnet was a tavern , large or small ) , gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through , and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do , with ease , in a few hours , what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by observing that a boy , who had passed him carelessly some minutes before , had returned , and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long , that oliver raised his head , and returned his steady look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what s the row? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was short of his age: with rather bow - legs , and little , sharp , ugly eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly , that it threatened to fall off every momentand would have done so , very often , if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch , which brought it back to its old place again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had turned the cuffs back , half - way up his arm , to get his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he kept them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was , altogether , as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six , or something less , in the bluchers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what s the row? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am very hungry and tired , replied oliver: the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have walked a long way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have been walking these seven days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - walking for sivin days! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the young gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , i see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beak s order , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , he added , noticing oliver s look of surprise ,  - i suppose you don t know what a beak is , my flash com - pan - i - on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver mildly replied , that he had always heard a bird s mouth described by the term in question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the young gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , a beak s a madgst rate; and when you walk by a beak s order , it s not straight forerd , but always agoing up , and niver a coming down agin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was you never on the mill? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what mill? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but come , said the young gentleman;  - you want grub , and you shall have it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i m at low - water - mark myselfonly one bob and a magpie; but , as far as it goes , i ll fork out and stump . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> up with you on your pins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now then! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morrice! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> assisting oliver to rise , the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandler s shop , where he purchased a sufficiency of ready - dressed ham and a half - quartern loaf , or , as he himself expressed it ,  - a fourpenny bran! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust , by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb , and stuffing it therein . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> taking the bread under his arm , the young gentleman turned into a small public - house , and led the way to a tap - room in the rear of the premises . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , a pot of beer was brought in , by direction of the mysterious youth; and oliver , falling to , at his new friend s bidding , made a long and hearty meal , during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - going to london? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the strange boy , when oliver had at length concluded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - got any lodgings? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - money? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets , as far as the big coat - sleeves would let them go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you live in london? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i do , when i m at home , replied the boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do , indeed , answered oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have not slept under a roof since i left the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not in the least! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by no means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> certainly not! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young gentleman smiled , as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted; especially as it was immediately followed up , by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to , would doubtless provide oliver with a comfortable place , without loss of time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue; from which oliver discovered that his friend s name was jack dawkins , and that he was a peculiar pet and protg of the elderly gentleman before mentioned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> under this impression , he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and , if he found the dodger incorrigible , as he more than half suspected he should , to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as john dawkins objected to their entering london before nightfall , it was nearly eleven o clock when they reached the turnpike at islington . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they crossed from the angel into st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> john s road; struck down the small street which terminates at sadler s wells theatre; through exmouth street and coppice row; down the little court by the side of the workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of hockley - in - the - hole; thence into little saffron hill; and so into saffron hill the great: along which the dodger scudded at a rapid pace , directing oliver to follow close at his heels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the street was very narrow and muddy , and the air was impregnated with filthy odours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place , were the public - houses; and in them , the lowest orders of irish were wrangling with might and main . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> covered ways and yards , which here and there diverged from the main street , disclosed little knots of houses , where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth; and from several of the door - ways , great ill - looking fellows were cautiously emerging , bound , to all appearance , on no very well - disposed or harmless errands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver was just considering whether he hadn t better run away , when they reached the bottom of the hill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his conductor , catching him by the arm , pushed open the door of a house near field lane; and drawing him into the passage , closed it behind them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , then! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried a voice from below , in reply to a whistle from the dodger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was the reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage; and a man s face peeped out , from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who s the t other one? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where did he come from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - greenland . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is fagin upstairs? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , he s a sortin  the wipes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the candle was drawn back , and the face disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a frying - pan , which was on the fire , and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string , some sausages were cooking; and standing over them , with a toasting - fork in his hand , was a very old shrivelled jew , whose villainous - looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was dressed in a greasy flannel gown , with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying - pan and the clothes - horse , over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> several rough beds made of old sacks , were huddled side by side on the floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seated round the table were four or five boys , none older than the dodger , smoking long clay pipes , and drinking spirits with the air of middle - aged men . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the jew; and then turned round and grinned at oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so did the jew himself , toasting - fork in hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is him , fagin , said jack dawkins;  - my friend oliver twist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew grinned; and , making a low obeisance to oliver , took him by the hand , and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon this , the young gentleman with the pipes came round him , and shook both his hands very hardespecially the one in which he held his little bundle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets , in order that , as he was very tired , he might not have the trouble of emptying them , himself , when he went to bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these civilities would probably be extended much farther , but for a liberal exercise of the jew s toasting - fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we are very glad to see you , oliver , very , said the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , you re a - staring at the pocket - handkerchiefs! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eh , my dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are a good many of  em , ain t there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter part of this speech , was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the midst of which they went to supper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver ate his share , and the jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin and water , telling him he must drink it off directly , because another gentleman wanted the tumbler . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver did as he was desired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was late next morning when oliver awoke , from a sound , long sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no other person in the room but the old jew , who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast , and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round , with an iron spoon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied himself , he would go on whistling and stirring again , as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although oliver had roused himself from sleep , he was not thoroughly awake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a drowsy state , between sleeping and waking , when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open , and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you , than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed , and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver was precisely in this condition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw the jew with his half - closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan s sides: and yet the self - same senses were mentally engaged , at the same time , in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the coffee was done , the jew drew the saucepan to the hob . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did not answer , and was to all appearances asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - aha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the jew , shrugging up his shoulders , and distorting every feature with a hideous grin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - clever dogs! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> clever dogs! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> staunch to the last! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never told the old parson where they were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and why should they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it wouldn t have loosened the knot , or kept the drop up , a minute longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , no , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fine fellows! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fine fellows! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having replaced these trinkets , the jew took out another: so small that it lay in the palm of his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length he put it down , as if despairing of success; and , leaning back in his chair , muttered: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a fine thing capital punishment is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dead men never repent; dead men never bring awkward stories to light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah , it s a fine thing for the trade! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> five of  em strung up in a row , and none left to play booty , or turn white - livered! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and , laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table , started furiously up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he trembled very much though; for , even in his terror , oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what have you seen? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> speak out , boy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> quickquick! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you sure? </s> </s>

<s> <s> you re a brave boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you re a brave boy , oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle , but glanced uneasily at the box , notwithstanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you see any of these pretty things , my dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s>

<s> <s> the folks call me a miser , my dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place , with so many watches; but , thinking that perhaps his fondness for the dodger and the other boys , cost him a good deal of money , he only cast a deferential look at the jew , and asked if he might get up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , my dear , certainly , replied the old gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he had scarcely washed himself , and made everything tidy , by emptying the basin out of the window , agreeably to the jew s directions , when the dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend , whom oliver had seen smoking on the previous night , and who was now formally introduced to him as charley bates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the jew , glancing slyly at oliver , and addressing himself to the dodger ,  - i hope you ve been at work this morning , my dears? </s> </s>

<s> <s> charles bates laughed uproariously; very much to the amazement of oliver , who saw nothing to laugh at , in anything that had passed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fagin to charley bates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wipes , replied master bates; at the same time producing four pocket - handkerchiefs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the jew , inspecting them closely;  - they re very good ones , very . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shall us , oliver , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you please , sir , said oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you d like to be able to make pocket - handkerchiefs as easy as charley bates , wouldn t you , my dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very much , indeed , if you ll teach me , sir , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> master bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply , that he burst into another laugh; which laugh , meeting the coffee he was drinking , and carrying it down some wrong channel , very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is so jolly green! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dodger said nothing , but he smoothed oliver s hair over his eyes , and said he d know better , by and by; upon which the old gentleman , observing oliver s colour mounting , changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there; and oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentleman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game , which was performed in this way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the merry old gentleman , placing a snuff - box in one pocket of his trousers , a note - case in the other , and a watch in his waistcoat pocket , with a guard - chain round his neck , and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him , and putting his spectacle - case and handkerchief in his pockets , trotted up and down the room with a stick , in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at such times , he would look constantly round him , for fear of thieves , and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn , to see that he hadn t lost anything , in such a very funny and natural manner , that oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this time , the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his sight , so nimbly , every time he turned round , that it was impossible to follow their motions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last , the dodger trod upon his toes , or ran upon his boot accidently , while charley bates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from him , with the most extraordinary rapidity , snuff - box , note - case , watch - guard , chain , shirt - pin , pocket - handkerchief , even the spectacle - case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when this game had been played a great many times , a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named bet , and the other nancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they wore a good deal of hair , not very neatly turned up behind , and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spirits were produced , in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , charley bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , my dear , said fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they have gone out for the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have they done work , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said the jew;  - that is , unless they should unexpectedly come across any , when they are out; and they won t neglect it , if they do , my dear , depend upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make  em your models , my dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make  em your models , tapping the fire - shovel on the hearth to add force to his words;  - do everything they bid you , and take their advice in all mattersespecially the dodger s , my dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket , my dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the jew , stopping short . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , said oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand , as he had seen the dodger hold it , and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it gone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here it is , sir , said oliver , showing it in his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never saw a sharper lad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here s a shilling for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you go on , in this way , you ll be the greatest man of the time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now come here , and i ll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman s pocket in play , had to do with his chances of being a great man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for many days , oliver remained in the jew s room , picking the marks out of the pocket - handkerchief , ( of which a great number were brought home , ) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the jew played , regularly , every morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , he began to languish for fresh air , and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed , by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman s character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whenever the dodger or charley bates came home at night , empty - handed , he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life , by sending them supperless to bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , one morning , oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman s giving his assent; but , whether they were or no , he told oliver he might go , and placed him under the joint guardianship of charley bates , and his friend the dodger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the three boys sallied out; the dodger with his coat - sleeves tucked up , and his hat cocked , as usual; master bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets; and oliver between them , wondering where they were going , and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dodger had a vicious propensity , too , of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas; while charley bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property , by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides , and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious , that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in clerkenwell , which is yet called , by some strange perversion of terms ,  - the green: when the dodger made a sudden stop; and , laying his finger on his lip , drew his companions back again , with the greatest caution and circumspection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you see that old cove at the book - stall? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the old gentleman over the way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i see him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver looked from one to the other , with the greatest surprise; but he was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked stealthily across the road , and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver walked a few paces after them; and , not knowing whether to advance or retire , stood looking on in silent amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old gentleman was a very respectable - looking personage , with a powdered head and gold spectacles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had taken up a book from the stall , and there he stood , reading away , as hard as if he were in his elbow - chair , in his own study . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is very possible that he fancied himself there , indeed; for it was plain , from his abstraction , that he saw not the book - stall , nor the street , nor the boys , nor , in short , anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through: turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page , beginning at the top line of the next one , and going regularly on , with the greatest interest and eagerness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was oliver s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off , looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go , to see the dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman s pocket , and draw from thence a handkerchief! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs , and the watches , and the jewels , and the jew , rushed upon the boy s mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stood , for a moment , with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror , that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then , confused and frightened , he took to his heels; and , not knowing what he did , made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the very instant when oliver began to run , the old gentleman , putting his hand to his pocket , and missing his handkerchief , turned sharp round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace , he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator; and shouting  - stop thief! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with all his might , made off after him , book in hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue - and - cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dodger and master bates , unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street , had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they no sooner heard the cry , and saw oliver running , than , guessing exactly how the matter stood , they issued forth with great promptitude; and , shouting  - stop thief! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> too , joined in the pursuit like good citizens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although oliver had been brought up by philosophers , he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self - preservation is the first law of nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he had been , perhaps he would have been prepared for this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not being prepared , however , it alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind , with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tradesman leaves his counter , and the car - man his waggon; the butcher throws down his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand - boy his parcels; the school - boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> away they run , pell - mell , helter - skelter , slap - dash: tearing , yelling , screaming , knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners , rousing up the dogs , and astonishing the fowls: and streets , squares , and courts , re - echo with the sound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stop thief! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stop thief! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one wretched breathless child , panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track , and gain upon him every instant , they hail his decreasing strength with joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ay , stop him for god s sake , were it only in mercy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stopped at last! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is down upon the pavement; and the crowd eagerly gather round him: each new comer , jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stand aside! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nonsense! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he don t deserve it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where s the gentleman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here he is , coming down the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - make room there for the gentleman! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is this the boy , sir! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver lay , covered with mud and dust , and bleeding from the mouth , looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him , when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , said the gentleman ,  - i am afraid it is the boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - afraid! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor fellow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did that , sir , said a great lubberly fellow , stepping forward;  - and preciously i cut my knuckle agin  his mouth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fellow touched his hat with a grin , expecting something for his pains; but , the old gentleman , eyeing him with an expression of dislike , look anxiously round , as if he contemplated running away himself: which it is very possible he might have attempted to do , and thus have afforded another chase , had not a police officer ( who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases ) at that moment made his way through the crowd , and seized oliver by the collar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , get up , said the man , roughly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it wasn t me indeed , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they are here somewhere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , i know you; it won t do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you stand upon your legs , you young devil? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gentleman walked on with them by the officer s side; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat , got a little ahead , and stared back at oliver from time to time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boys shouted in triumph; and on they went . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying oliver through two or three streets , and down a place called mutton hill , when he was led beneath a low archway , and up a dirty court , into this dispensary of summary justice , by the back way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you the party that s been robbed , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the man with the keys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i am , replied the old gentleman;  - but i am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ii would rather not press the case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - must go before the magistrate now , sir , replied the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his worship will be disengaged in half a minute . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , young gallows! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was an invitation for oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke , and which led into a stone cell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here he was searched; and nothing being found upon him , locked up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar , only not so light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was most intolerably dirty; for it was monday morning; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people , who had been locked up , elsewhere , since saturday night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but this is little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in our station - houses , men and women are every night confined on the most trivial chargesthe word is worth notingin dungeons , compared with which , those in newgate , occupied by the most atrocious felons , tried , found guilty , and under sentence of death , are palaces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned with a sigh to the book , which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can he be innocent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he looked like bye the bye , exclaimed the old gentleman , halting very abruptly , and staring up into the sky ,  - bless my soul! where have i seen something like that look before? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said the old gentleman , shaking his head;  - it must be imagination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wandered over them again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had called them into view , and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were the faces of friends , and foes , and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon , but which the mind , superior to its power , still dressed in their old freshness and beauty , calling back the lustre of the eyes , the brightness of the smile , the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay , and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb , changed but to be heightened , and taken from earth only to be set up as a light , to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which oliver s features bore a trace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened; and being , happily for himself , an absent old gentleman , buried them again in the pages of the musty book . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was roused by a touch on the shoulder , and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he closed his book hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang sat behind a bar , at the upper end; and on one side of the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang was a lean , long - backed , stiff - necked , middle - sized man , with no great quantity of hair , and what he had , growing on the back and sides of his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his face was stern , and much flushed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate s desk , said , suiting the action to the word ,  - that is my name and address , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then withdrew a pace or two; and , with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head , waited to be questioned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , it so happened that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was out of temper; and he looked up with an angry scowl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who is this fellow? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person , under the protection of the bench . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> saying this , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - officer! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s not charged at all , your worship , replied the officer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he appears against this boy , your worship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance , and a safe one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - appears against the boy , does he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow contemptuously from head to foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - swear him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - before i am sworn , i must beg to say one word , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang , peremptorily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will not , sir! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hold your tongue this instant , or i ll have you turned out of the office! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you re an insolent impertinent fellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how dare you bully a magistrate! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the old gentleman , reddening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - swear this person! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fang to the clerk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll not hear another word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps , that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it , he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what have you got to say , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow began . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hold your tongue , sir , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - policeman! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where s the policeman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , swear this policeman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , policeman , what is this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the policeman , with becoming humility , related how he had taken the charge; how he had searched oliver , and found nothing on his person; and how that was all he knew about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - none , your worship , replied the policeman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is , man , or do you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have been sworn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with many interruptions , and repeated insults , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow contrived to state his case; observing that , in the surprise of the moment , he had run after the boy because he had seen him running away; and expressing his hope that , if the magistrate should believe him , although not actually the thief , to be connected with the thieves , he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has been hurt already , said the old gentleman in conclusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i fear , he added , with great energy , looking towards the bar ,  - i really fear that he is ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , i dare say! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang , with a sneer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , none of your tricks here , you young vagabond; they won t do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what s your name? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was deadly pale; and the whole place seemed turning round and round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was addressed to a bluff old fellow , in a striped waistcoat , who was standing by the bar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he bent over oliver , and repeated the inquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more , and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , he won t speak out , won t he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very well , very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where does he live? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where he can , your worship , replied the officer; again pretending to receive oliver s answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - has he any parents? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he says they died in his infancy , your worship , replied the officer: hazarding the usual reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this point of the inquiry , oliver raised his head; and , looking round with imploring eyes , murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stuff and nonsense! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang:  - don t try to make a fool of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think he really is ill , your worship , remonstrated the officer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know better , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stand away , officer , cried fang;  - let him , if he likes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the men in the office looked at each other , but no one dared to stir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i knew he was shamming , said fang , as if this were incontestable proof of the fact . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let him lie there; he ll soon be tired of that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how do you propose to deal with the case , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he stands committed for three monthshard labour of course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> clear the office . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door was opened for this purpose , and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance , clad in an old suit of black , rushed hastily into the office , and advanced towards the bench . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stop , stop! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t take him away! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for heaven s sake stop a moment! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the new comer , breathless with haste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although the presiding genii in such an office as this , exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties , the good name , the character , almost the lives , of her majesty s subjects , especially of the poorer class; and although , within such walls , enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the public , save through the medium of the daily press . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who is this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will speak , cried the man;  - i will not be turned out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i demand to be sworn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will not be put down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang , you must hear me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man was right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his manner was determined; and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - swear the man , growled mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fang , with a very ill grace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , man , what have you got to say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this , said the man:  - i saw three boys: two others and the prisoner here: loitering on the opposite side of the way , when this gentleman was reading . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw it done; and i saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having by this time recovered a little breath , the worthy book - stall keeper proceeded to relate , in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why didn t you come here before? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fang , after a pause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hadn t a soul to mind the shop , replied the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - everybody who could have helped me , had joined in the pursuit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could get nobody till five minutes ago; and i ve run here all the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the prosecutor was reading , was he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired fang , after another pause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , that book , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fang . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it paid for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , it is not , replied the man , with a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dear me , i forgot all about it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the absent old gentleman , innocently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boy is discharged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dn me! </s> </s>

<s> <s> said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , bending over him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - call a coach , somebody , pray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> directly! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a coach was obtained , and oliver having been carefully laid on the seat , the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may i accompany you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the book - stall keeper , looking in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bless me , yes , my dear sir , said mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the book - stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the coach rattled away , over nearly the same ground as that which oliver had traversed when he first entered london in company with the dodger; and , turning a different way when it reached the angel at islington , stopped at length before a neat house , in a quiet shady street near pentonville . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , a bed was prepared , without loss of time , in which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited; and here , he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , for many days , oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sun rose and sank , and rose and sank again , and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed , dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the worm does not work more surely on the dead body , than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> weak , and thin , and pallid , he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> feebly raising himself in the bed , with his head resting on his trembling arm , he looked anxiously around . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what room is this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where have i been brought to? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he uttered these words in a feeble voice , being very faint and weak; but they were overheard at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curtain at the bed s head was hastily drawn back , and a motherly old lady , very neatly and precisely dressed , rose as she undrew it , from an arm - chair close by , in which she had been sitting at needle - work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush , my dear , said the old lady softly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must be very quiet , or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad ,as bad as bad could be , pretty nigh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lie down again; there s a dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with those words , the old lady very gently placed oliver s head upon the pillow; and , smoothing back his hair from his forehead , looked so kindly and loving in his face , that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers , and drawing it round his neck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - save us! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the old lady , with tears in her eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pretty creetur! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps she does see me , whispered oliver , folding his hands together;  - perhaps she has sat by me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that was the fever , my dear , said the old lady mildly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i suppose it was , replied oliver ,  - because heaven is a long way off; and they are too happy there , to come down to the bedside of a poor boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but if she knew i was ill , she must have pitied me , even there; for she was very ill herself before she died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she can t know anything about me though , added oliver after a moment s silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first , and her spectacles , which lay on the counterpane , afterwards , as if they were part and parcel of those features , brought some cool stuff for oliver to drink; and then , patting him on the cheek , told him he must lie very quiet , or he would be ill again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things; and partly , to tell the truth , because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he soon fell into a gentle doze , from which he was awakened by the light of a candle: which , being brought near the bed , showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud - ticking gold watch in his hand , who felt his pulse , and said he was a great deal better . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are a great deal better , are you not , my dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , thank you , sir , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i know you are , said the gentleman:  - you re hungry too , an t you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir , answered oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hem! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i know you re not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is not hungry , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin , said the gentleman: looking very wise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you feel sleepy , don t you , my dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor thirsty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , rather thirsty , answered oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just as i expected , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin , said the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s very natural that he should be thirsty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t keep him too warm , ma am; but be careful that you don t let him be too cold; will you have the goodness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old lady dropped a curtsey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor , after tasting the cool stuff , and expressing a qualified approval of it , hurried away: his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver dozed off again , soon after this; when he awoke , it was nearly twelve o clock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old lady tenderly bade him good - night shortly afterwards , and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come: bringing with her , in a little bundle , a small prayer book and a large nightcap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> putting the latter on her head and the former on the table , the old woman , after telling oliver that she had come to sit up with him , drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps , chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward , and divers moans and chokings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these , however , had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard , and then fall asleep again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and thus the night crept slowly on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into the boy s mind the thought that death had been hovering there , for many days and nights , and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence , he turned his face upon the pillow , and fervently prayed to heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gradually , he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he belonged to the world again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having him set , here , by the fire - side , the good old lady sat herself down too; and , being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better , forthwith began to cry most violently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never mind me , my dear , said the old lady;  - i m only having a regular good cry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there; it s all over now; and i m quite comfortable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you re very , very kind to me , ma am , said oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , never you mind that , my dear , said the old lady;  - that s got nothing to do with your broth; and it s full time you had it; for the doctor says mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and with this , the old lady applied herself to warming up , in a little saucepan , a basin full of broth: strong enough , oliver thought , to furnish an ample dinner , when reduced to the regulation strength , for three hundred and fifty paupers , at the lowest computation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the old lady , seeing that oliver had fixed his eyes , most intently , on a portrait which hung against the wall; just opposite his chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t quite know , ma am , said oliver , without taking his eyes from the canvas;  - i have seen so few that i hardly know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the old lady ,  - painters always make ladies out prettier than they are , or they wouldn t get any custom , child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed; it s a deal too honest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a deal , said the old lady , laughing very heartily at her own acuteness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - isis that a likeness , ma am? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whose , ma am? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seems to strike your fancy , dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is so pretty , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , sure you re not afraid of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh no , no , returned oliver quickly;  - but the eyes look so sorrowful; and where i sit , they seem fixed upon me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it makes my heart beat , added oliver in a low voice ,  - as if it was alive , and wanted to speak to me , but couldn t . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lord save us! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the old lady , starting;  - don t talk in that way , child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you re weak and nervous after your illness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the old lady , suiting the action to the word;  - you don t see it now , at all events . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver did see it in his mind s eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin , satisfied that he felt more comfortable , salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth , with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation . </s> </s>

<s> <s> now , the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but , he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead , and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing - gown to take a good long look at oliver , than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness , and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up , out of respect to his benefactor , which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again; and the fact is , if the truth must be told , that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow s heart , being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition , forced a supply of tears into his eyes , by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor boy , poor boy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , clearing his throat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope not , sir , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - everything you have had , has been well aired , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i don t know , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow;  - i rather think i had a damp napkin at dinner - time yesterday; but never mind that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very happy , sir , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , stoutly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you given him any nourishment , bedwin? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> any slops , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth , sir , replied mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin , drawing herself up slightly , and laying strong emphasis on the last word , to intimate that between slops , and broth well compounded , there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ugh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , with a slight shudder;  - a couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my name is oliver , sir , replied the little invalid with a look of great astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oliver , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow;  - oliver what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver white , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir , twist , oliver twist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - queer name! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the old gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never told him so , sir , returned oliver in amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this sounded so like a falsehood , that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in oliver s face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was impossible to doubt him; there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - some mistake , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , although his motive for looking steadily at oliver no longer existed , the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly , that he could not withdraw his gaze . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said oliver , raising his eyes beseechingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , replied the old gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what s this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin , look there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke , he pointed hastily to the picture over oliver s head , and then to the boy s face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was its living copy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the eyes , the head , the mouth; every feature was the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the expression was , for the instant , so precisely alike , that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a weakness on his part , which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense , in behalf of the two young pupils of the merry old gentleman; and of recording<s> <s> that when the dodger , and his accomplished friend master bates , joined in the hue - and - cry which was raised at oliver s heels , in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow s personal property , as has been already described , they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true - hearted englishman , so , i need hardly beg the reader to observe , that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men , in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound - judging philosophers have laid down as the main - springs of all nature s deeds and actions: the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady s proceedings to matters of maxim and theory: and , by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding , putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart , or generous impulse and feeling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for , these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament , i should at once find it in the fact ( also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative ) , of their quitting the pursuit , when the general attention was fixed upon oliver; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although i do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages , to shorten the road to any great conclusion ( their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance , by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings , like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas , are prone to indulge ); still , i do mean to say , and do say distinctly , that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers , in carrying out their theories , to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , to do a great right , you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be attained , will justify; the amount of the right , or the amount of the wrong , or indeed the distinction between the two , being left entirely to the philosopher concerned , to be settled and determined by his clear , comprehensive , and impartial view of his own particular case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the dodger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> roared charley bates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you want to be grabbed , stupid? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i can t help it , said charley ,  - i can t help it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the vivid imagination of master bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he arrived at this apostrophe , he again rolled upon the door - step , and laughed louder than before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated charley bates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the dodger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , what should he say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired charley: stopping rather suddenly in his merriment; for the dodger s manner was impressive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what should he say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then , taking off his hat , scratched his head , and nodded thrice . </s> </s>

<s> <s> said charley . </s> </s>

<s> <s> master bates followed , with a thoughtful countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs , a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation , roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a pocket - knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round , and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows , bent his ear towards the door , and listened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where s the third? </s> </s>

<s> <s> hark! </s> </s>

<s> <s> said the jew , rising with a menacing look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where s the boy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence; and looked uneasily at each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but they made no reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - speak out , or i ll throttle you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin looked so very much in earnest , that charley bates , who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side , and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second , dropped upon his knees , and raised a loud , well - sustained , and continuous roarsomething between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you speak? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thundered the jew: shaking the dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all , seemed perfectly miraculous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , the traps have got him , and that s all about it , said the dodger , sullenly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew stepped back in this emergency , with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and , seizing up the pot , prepared to hurl it at his assailant s head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> growled a deep voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wot s it all about , fagin? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dme , if my neck - handkercher an t lined with beer! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come in , you sneaking warmint; wot are you stopping outside for , as if you was ashamed of your master! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come in! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he disclosed , when he had done so , a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days  growth , and two scowling eyes; one of which displayed various parti - coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come in , d ye hear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> growled this engaging ruffian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you re getting too proud to own me afore company , are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lie down! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he appeared well used to it , however; for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly , without uttering a sound , and winking his very ill - looking eyes twenty times in a minute , appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the man , seating himself deliberately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would if i was them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i d been your  prentice , i d have done it long ago , andno , i couldn t have sold you afterwards , for you re fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle , and i suppose they don t blow glass bottles large enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - none of your mistering , replied the ruffian;  - you always mean mischief when you come that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you seem out of humour , bill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps i am , replied sikes;  - i should think you was rather out of sorts too , unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about , as you do when you blab and<s> <s>  - are you mad? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the jew , catching the man by the sleeve , and pointing towards the boys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then , in cant terms , with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled , but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here , demanded a glass of liquor . </s> </s>

<s> <s> sikes , laying his hat upon the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard , he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary , or the wish ( at all events ) to improve upon the distiller s ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman s merry heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i m afraid , you see , added the jew , speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did so , - i m afraid that , if the game was up with us , it might be up with a good many more , and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me , my dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man started , and turned round upon the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the old gentleman s shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a long pause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog , who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - somebody must find out wot s been done at the office , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew nodded assent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes ,  - and then he must be taken care on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must get hold of him somehow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again the jew nodded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the prudence of this line of action , indeed , was obvious; but , unfortunately , there was one very strong objection to its being adopted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> william sikes , happened , one and all , to entertain a violent and deeply - rooted antipathy to going near a police - office on any ground or pretext whatever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how long they might have sat and looked at each other , in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind , it is difficult to guess . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - only just up to the office , my dear , said the jew coaxingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not , but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be  - blessed if she would; a polite and delicate evasion of the request , which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow - creature , the pain of a direct and pointed refusal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned from this young lady , who was gaily , not to say gorgeously attired , in a red gown , green boots , and yellow curl - papers , to the other female . </s> </s>

<s> <s> sikes was right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was not , indeed , withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend; for , having recently removed into the neighbourhood of field lane from the remote but genteel suburb of ratcliffe , she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - give her a door - key to carry in her t other one , fagin , said sikes;  - it looks real and genivine like . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , my dear , so it does , said the jew , hanging a large street - door key on the forefinger of the young lady s right hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> very good indeed , my dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my brother! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my poor , dear , sweet , innocent little brother! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what has become of him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , do have pity , and tell me what s been done with the dear boy , gentlemen; do , gentlemen , if you please , gentlemen! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart - broken tone: to the immeasurable delight of her hearers: miss nancy paused , winked to the company , nodded smilingly round , and disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here s her health , and wishing they was all like her! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> entering by the back way , she tapped softly with the key at one of the cell - doors , and listened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still there was no reply: so she spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nolly , dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal , who had been taken up for playing the flute , and who , the offence against society having been clearly proved , had been very properly committed by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired nancy , with a preliminary sob . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied the voice;  - god forbid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the next cell was another man , who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license; thereby doing something for his living , in defiance of the stamp - office . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , as neither of these criminals answered to the name of oliver , or knew anything about him , nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations , rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street - door key and the little basket , demanded her own dear brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> screamed nancy , in a distracted manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , the gentleman s got him , replied the officer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what gentleman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed nancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in reply to this incoherent questioning , the old man informed the deeply affected sister that oliver had been taken ill in the office , and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy , not in custody; and that the prosecutor had carried him away , in an insensible condition , to his own residence: of and concerning which , all the informant knew was , that it was somewhere in pentonville , he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we must know where he is , my dears; he must be found , said the jew greatly excited . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you ll know where to find me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t stop here a minute . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not an instant , my dears! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these words , he pushed them from the room: and carefully double - locking and barring the door behind them , drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a rap at the door startled him in this occupation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who s there? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , replied the jew ,  - wherever she lays hands on him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boy murmured a reply of intelligence: and hurried downstairs after his companions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he has not peached so far , said the jew as he pursued his occupation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver soon recovering from the fainting - fit into which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow s abrupt exclamation had thrown him , the subject of the picture was carefully avoided , both by the old gentleman and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the housekeeper , watching the direction of oliver s eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see it is ma am , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why have they taken it away? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it has been taken down , child , because mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow said , that as it seemed to worry you , perhaps it might prevent your getting well , you know , rejoined the old lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no , indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it didn t worry me , ma am , said oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i liked to see it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i quite loved it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i promise you that! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was all the information oliver could obtain about the picture at that time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness , he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him , about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers , who was married to an amiable and handsome man , and lived in the country; and about a son , who was clerk to a merchant in the west indies; and who was , also , such a good young man , and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a year , that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the old lady had expatiated , a long time , on the excellences of her children , and the merits of her kind good husband besides , who had been dead and gone , poor dear soul! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just six - and - twenty years , it was time to have tea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were happy days , those of oliver s recovery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> everything was so quiet , and neat , and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived , it seemed like heaven itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on , properly , than mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow caused a complete new suit , and a new cap , and a new pair of shoes , to be provided for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes , he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him , and asked her to sell them to a jew , and keep the money for herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one evening , about a week after the affair of the picture , as he was sitting talking to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin , there came a message down from mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bless us , and save us! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wash your hands , and let me part your hair nicely for you , child , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if we had known he would have asked for you , we would have put you a clean collar on , and made you as smart as sixpence! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus encouraged , oliver tapped at the study door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow calling to him to come in , he found himself in a little back room , quite full of books , with a window , looking into some pleasant little gardens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a table drawn up before the window , at which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow was seated reading . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he saw oliver , he pushed the book away from him , and told him to come near the table , and sit down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> which is still a marvel to more experienced people than oliver twist , every day of their lives . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , observing the curiosity with which oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a great number , sir , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you shall read them , if you behave well , said the old gentleman kindly;  - and you will like that , better than looking at the outsides ,that is , some cases; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i suppose they are those heavy ones , sir , said oliver , pointing to some large quartos , with a good deal of gilding about the binding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how should you like to grow up a clever man , and write books , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think i would rather read them , sir , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wouldn t you like to be a book - writer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the old gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver considered a little while; and at last said , he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book - seller; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily , and declared he had said a very good thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> which oliver felt glad to have done , though he by no means knew what it was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we won t make an author of you , while there s an honest trade to be learnt , or brick - making to turn to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , speaking if possible in a kinder , but at the same time in a much more serious manner , than oliver had ever known him assume yet ,  - i want you to pay great attention , my boy , to what i am going to say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall talk to you without any reserve; because i am sure you are well able to understand me , as many older persons would be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , don t tell you are going to send me away , sir , pray! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed oliver , alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman s commencement! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me stay here , and be a servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear child , said the old gentleman , moved by the warmth of oliver s sudden appeal;  - you need not be afraid of my deserting you , unless you give me cause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never , never will , sir , interposed oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not think you ever will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the persons on whom i have bestowed my dearest love , lie deep in their graves; but , although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too , i have not made a coffin of my heart , and sealed it up , forever , on my best affections . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to his companion: and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: oliver sat quite still . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you say you are an orphan , without a friend in the world; all the inquiries i have been able to make , confirm the statement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which i found you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> speak the truth , and you shall not be friendless while i live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm , and carried to the workhouse by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is he coming up? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he asked if there were any muffins in the house; and , when i told him yes , he said he had come to tea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow smiled; and , turning to oliver , said that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig was an old friend of his , and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom , as he had reason to know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow ,  - i would rather you remained here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted , defy description . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> isn t it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that i can t call at a man s house but i find a piece of this poor surgeon s friend on the staircase? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was the handsome offer with which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his case , because , even admitting for the sake of argument , the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig s head was such a particularly large one , that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sittingto put entirely out of the question , a very thick coating of powder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll eat my head , sir , repeated mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hallo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is young oliver twist , whom we were speaking about , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver bowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you don t mean to say that s the boy who had the fever , i hope? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig , recoiling a little more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait a minute! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t speak! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stop continued mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig , abruptly , losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery;  - that s the boy who had the orange! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if that s not the boy , sir , who had the orange , and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase , i ll eat my head , and his too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> put down your hat; and speak to my young friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i feel strongly on this subject , sir , said the irritable old gentleman , drawing off his gloves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there s always more or less orange - peel on the pavement in our street; and i know it s put there by the surgeon s boy at the corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a young woman stumbled over a bit last night , and fell against my garden - railings; directly she got up i saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime - light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t go to him ,  i called out of the window , he s an assassin! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man - trap!   so he is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he is not here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was always understood , by his friends , to imply the customary offer , whenever it was not expressed in words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , still keeping his stick in his hand , he sat down; and , opening a double eye - glass , which he wore attached to a broad black riband , took a view of oliver: who , seeing that he was the object of inspection , coloured , and bowed again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s the boy , is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s the boy , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how are you , boy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a great deal better , thank you , sir , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable , asked oliver to step downstairs and tell mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin they were ready for tea; which , as he did not half like the visitor s manner , he was very happy to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t know , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i don t know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mealy boys , and beef - faced boys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and which is oliver? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know a friend who has a beef - faced boy; a fine boy , they call him; with a round head , and red cheeks , and glaring eyes; a horrid boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot , and the appetite of a wolf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the wretch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they are not , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig the most exquisite delight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where does he come from! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who is he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has had a fever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what of that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bad people have fevers sometimes; haven t they , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i knew a man who was hung in jamaica for murdering his master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had had a fever six times; he wasn t recommended to mercy on that account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pooh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he had postponed any investigation into oliver s previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig chuckled maliciously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig , at tea , was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins , matters went on very smoothly; and oliver , who made one of the party , began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman s presence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and when are you going to hear a full , true , and particular account of the life and adventures of oliver twist? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked grimwig of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at oliver , as he resumed his subject . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tomorrow morning , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would rather he was alone with me at the time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come up to me tomorrow morning at ten o clock , my dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he answered with some hesitation , because he was confused by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll tell you what , whispered that gentleman to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow;  - he won t come up to you tomorrow morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw him hesitate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is deceiving you , my good friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll swear he is not , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , warmly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if he is not , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , knocking the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i for his falsehood with my head! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig , knocking the table also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , checking his rising anger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we will , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig , with a provoking smile;  - we will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall - keeper , who has already figured in this history; having laid them on the table , she prepared to leave the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stop the boy , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are some books to be taken back , too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the street - door was opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy; but there was no boy in sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver and the girl returned , in a breathless state , to report that there were no tidings of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow;  - i particularly wished those books to be returned tonight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - send oliver with them , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; do let me take them , if you please , sir , said oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll run all the way , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old gentleman was just going to say that oliver should not go out on any account; when a most malicious cough from mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig determined him that he should; and that , by his prompt discharge of the commission , he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions: on this head at least: at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you shall go , my dear , said the old gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver , delighted to be of use , brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle; and waited , cap in hand , to hear what message he was to take . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , glancing steadily at grimwig;  - you are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have come to pay the four pound ten i owe him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is a five - pound note , so you will have to bring me back , ten shillings change . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i won t be ten minutes , sir , said oliver , eagerly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin followed him to the street - door , giving him many directions about the nearest way , and the name of the bookseller , and the name of the street: all of which oliver said he clearly understood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold , the old lady at length permitted him to depart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bless his sweet face! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the old lady , looking after him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i can t bear , somehow , to let him go out of my sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment , oliver looked gaily round , and nodded before he turned the corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me see; he ll be back in twenty minutes , at the longest , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , pulling out his watch , and placing it on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it will be dark by that time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , smiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the spirit of contradiction was strong in mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , he said , smiting the table with his fist ,  - i do not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he ll join his old friends the thieves , and laugh at you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if ever that boy returns to this house , sir , i ll eat my head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is worthy of remark , as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments , and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions , that , although mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig was not by any means a bad - hearted man , and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived , he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment , that oliver twist might not come back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the obscure parlour of a low public - house , in the filthiest part of little saffron hill; a dark and gloomy den , where a flaring gas - light burnt all day in the winter - time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer: there sat , brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass , strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor , a man in a velveteen coat , drab shorts , half - boots and stockings , whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> william sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - keep quiet , you warmint! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> keep quiet! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , suddenly breaking silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog s winking , or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them , is matter for argument and consideration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whatever was the cause , the effect was a kick and a curse , bestowed upon the dog simultaneously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters; but mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having given in a hearty shake , he retired , growling , under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes levelled at his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you would , would you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sikes , seizing the poker in one hand , and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp - knife , which he drew from his pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come here , you born devil! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> d ye hear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dog no doubt heard; because mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> sikes the more; who , dropping on his knees , began to assail the animal most furiously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dog jumped from right to left , and from left to right; snapping , growling , and barking; the man thrust and swore , and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when , the door suddenly opening , the dog darted out: leaving bill sikes with the poker and the clasp - knife in his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there must always be two parties to a quarrel , says the old adage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sikes , with a fierce gesture . </s> </s>

<s> <s> growled sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - couldn t you hear the noise? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sneaking in and out , so as nobody hears how you come or go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the jew with a forced smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  -  cause the government , as cares for the lives of such men as you , as haven t half the pluck of curs , lets a man kill a dog how he likes , replied sikes , shutting up the knife with a very expressive look;  - that s why . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was obviously very ill at ease , however . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - grin away , said sikes , replacing the poker , and surveying him with savage contempt;  - grin away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you ll never have the laugh at me , though , unless it s behind a nightcap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ve got the upper hand over you , fagin; and , dme , i ll keep it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i go , you go; so take care of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - humph , said sikes , as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the jew s side than on his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , what have you got to say to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s all passed safe through the melting - pot , replied fagin ,  - and this is your share . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it s rather more than it ought to be , my dear; but as i know you ll do me a good turn another time , and<s> <s>  - stow that gammon , interposed the robber , impatiently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hand over! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , bill; give me time , give me time , replied the jew , soothingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here it is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke , he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one corner , produced a small brown - paper packet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all , replied the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you haven t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along , have you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t put on an injured look at the question; you ve done it many a time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jerk the tinkler . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these words , in plain english , conveyed an injunction to ring the bell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was answered by another jew: younger than fagin , but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was lost upon sikes , who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot - lace which the dog had torn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> possibly , if he had observed the brief interchange of signals , he might have thought that it boded no good to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is anybody here , barney? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired fagin; speaking , now that sikes was looking on , without raising his eyes from the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dot a shoul , replied barney; whose words: whether they came from the heart or not: made their way through the nose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired fagin , in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might mean that barney was at liberty to tell the truth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dobody but biss dadsy , replied barney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> strike me blind , if i don t honour that  ere girl , for her native talents . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you are on the scent , are you , nancy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired sikes , proffering the glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i am , bill , replied the young lady , disposing of its contents;  - and tired enough of it i am , too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young brat s been ill and confined to the crib; and<s> <s>  - ah , nancy , dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fagin , looking up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , whether a peculiar contraction of the jew s red eye - brows , and a half closing of his deeply - set eyes , warned miss nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative , is not a matter of much importance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is , that she suddenly checked herself , and with several gracious smiles upon mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in about ten minutes  time , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders , and declared it was time to go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself , expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together , followed , at a little distant , by the dog , who slunk out of a back - yard as soon as his master was out of sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he got into clerkenwell , he accidently turned down a by - street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his mistake until he had got half - way down it , and knowing it must lead in the right direction , he did not think it worth while to turn back; and so marched on , as quickly as he could , with the books under his arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was walking along , thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little dick , who , starved and beaten , might be weeping bitterly at that very moment; when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , my dear brother! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he had hardly looked up , to see what the matter was , when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the only reply to this , was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a street - door key in her hand . </s> </s>

<s> <s> oh! </s> </s>

<s> <s> thank gracious goodness heavins , i ve found him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these incoherent exclamations , the young woman burst into another fit of crying , and got so dreadfully hysterical , that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butcher s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet , who was also looking on , whether he didn t think he had better run for the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which , the butcher s boy: who appeared of a lounging , not to say indolent disposition: replied , that he thought not . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i don t know her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , it s nancy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed oliver; who now saw her face for the first time; and started back , in irrepressible astonishment . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - that s right! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s the only way of bringing him to his senses! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to be sure! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried a sleepy - faced carpenter , casting an approving look at the garret - window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it ll do him good! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rejoined the man , administering another blow , and seizing oliver by the collar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come on , you young villain! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> darkness had set in; it was a low neighbourhood; no help was near; resistance was useless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was of little moment , indeed , whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them , had they been ever so plain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gas - lamps were lighted; mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat , perseveringly , in the dark parlour , with the watch between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the narrow streets and courts , at length , terminated in a large open space; scattered about which , were pens for beasts , and other indications of a cattle - market . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot: the girl being quite unable to support any longer , the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> turning to oliver , he roughly commanded him to take hold of nancy s hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you hear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> growled sikes , as oliver hesitated , and looked round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were in a dark corner , quite out of the track of passengers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here , bull s - eye! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dog looked up , and growled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - see here , boy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sikes , putting his other hand to oliver s throat;  - if he speaks ever so soft a word , hold him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dog growled again; and licking his lips , eyed oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s as willing as a christian , strike me blind if he isn t! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was smithfield that they were crossing , although it might have been grosvenor square , for anything oliver knew to the contrary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist , which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in oliver s eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had hurried on a few paces , when a deep church - bell struck the hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with its first stroke , his two conductors stopped , and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s the good of telling me that; i can hear it , can t i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wonder whether they can hear it , said nancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was bartlemy time when i was shopped; and there warn t a penny trumpet in the fair , as i couldn t hear the squeaking on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor fellow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said nancy , who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; that s all you women think of , answered sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , they re as good as dead , so it don t much matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this consolation , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy , and , clasping oliver s wrist more firmly , told him to step out again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait a minute! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what good would that do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the unsentimental mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope , you might as well be walking fifty mile off , or not walking at all , for all the good it would do me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come on , and don t stand preaching there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nancy stooped below the shutters , and oliver heard the sound of a bell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they crossed to the opposite side of the street , and stood for a few moments under a lamp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a noise , as if a sash window were gently raised , was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and all three were quickly inside the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they waited , while the person who had let them in , chained and barred the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - anybody here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied a voice , which oliver thought he had heard before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is the old  un here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the robber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied the voice ,  - and precious down in the mouth he has been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the style of this reply , as well as the voice which delivered it , seemed familiar to oliver s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look after your legs if you do! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and , in another minute , the form of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried master charles bates , from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded:  - here he is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , cry , here he is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , fagin , look at him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin , do look at him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can t bear it; it is such a jolly game , i can t bear it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the artful , meantime , who was of a rather saturnine disposition , and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business , rifled oliver s pockets with steady assiduity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look at his togs , fagin! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said charley , putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> superfine cloth , and the heavy swell cut! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , my eye , what a game! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and his books , too! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing but a gentleman , fagin! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the artful shall give you another suit , my dear , for fear you should spoil that sunday one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why didn t you write , my dear , and say you were coming? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at his , master bates roared again: so loud , that fagin himself relaxed , and even the dodger smiled; but as the artful drew forth the five - pound note at that instant , it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired sikes , stepping forward as the jew seized the note . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s mine , fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , my dear , said the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mine , bill , mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if that ain t mine! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver started too , though from a very different cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is hardly fair , bill; hardly fair , is it , nancy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fair , or not fair , retorted sikes ,  - hand over , i tell you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you think nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter , and kidnapping , every young boy as gets grabbed through you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give it here , you avaricious old skeleton , give it here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes plucked the note from between the jew s finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face , folded it up small , and tied it in his neckerchief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they re very pretty , said charley bates: who , with sundry grimaces , had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question;  - beautiful writing , isn t is , oliver? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at sight of the dismayed look with which oliver regarded his tormentors , master bates , who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous , fell into another ectasy , more boisterous than the first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they belong to the old gentleman , said oliver , wringing his hands;  - to the good , kind , old gentleman who took me into his house , and had me nursed , when i was near dying of the fever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , pray send them back; send him back the books and money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> keep me here all my life long; but pray , pray send them back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he ll think i stole them; the old lady: all of them who were so kind to me: will think i stole them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> chuckled the jew , rubbing his hands ,  - it couldn t have happened better , if we had chosen our time! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course it couldn t , replied sikes;  - i know d that , directly i see him coming through clerkenwell , with the books under his arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they re soft - hearted psalm - singers , or they wouldn t have taken him in at all; and they ll ask no questions after him , fear they should be obliged to prosecute , and so get him lagged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - keep back the dog , bill! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - serve him right! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried sikes , struggling to disengage himself from the girl s grasp . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stand off from me , or i ll split your head against the wall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sikes , setting his teeth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll soon do that , if you don t keep off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room , just as the jew and the two boys returned , dragging oliver among them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s the matter here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fagin , looking round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , she hasn t , said nancy , pale and breathless from the scuffle;  - no , she hasn t , fagin; don t think it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then keep quiet , will you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , i won t do that , neither , replied nancy , speaking very loud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do you think of that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which nancy belonged , to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her , at present . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so you wanted to get away , my dear , did you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver made no reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he watched the jew s motions , and breathed quickly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we ll cure you of that , my young master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew inflicted a smart blow on oliver s shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second , when the girl , rushing forward , wrested it from his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she flung it into the fire , with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i won t stand by and see it done , fagin , cried the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you ve got the boy , and what more would you have? let him belet him beor i shall put that mark on some of you , that will bring me to the gallows before my time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat; and with her lips compressed , and her hands clenched , looked alternately at the jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , nancy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear , you are acting beautifully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - am i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take care i don t overdo it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will be the worse for it , fagin , if i do; and so i tell you in good time to keep clear of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all her other strong passions , the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair; which few men like to provoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of miss nancy s rage; and , shrinking involuntarily back a few paces , cast a glance , half imploring and half cowardly , at sikes: as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of miss nancy to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats , the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged , however , he resorted to more tangible arguments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean by this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sikes; backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features: which , if it were heard above , only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below , would render blindness as common a disorder as measles:  - what do you mean by it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> burn my body! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , yes , i know all about it , replied the girl , laughing hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side , with a poor assumption of indifference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , keep quiet , rejoined sikes , with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog ,  - or i ll quiet you for a good long time to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and , darting a hasty look at sikes , turned her face aside , and bit her lip till the blood came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - god almighty help me , i am! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the girl passionately;  - and i wish i had been struck dead in the street , or had changed places with them we passed so near tonight , before i had lent a hand in bringing him here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he s a thief , a liar , a devil , all that s bad , from this night forth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> isn t that enough for the old wretch , without blows? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come , come , sikes , said the jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone , and motioning towards the boys , who were eagerly attentive to all that passed;  - we must have civil words; civil words , bill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - civil words! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the girl , whose passion was frightful to see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pointing to oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> speak out! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t you know it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well , replied the jew , with an attempt at pacification;  - and , if you have , it s your living! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl said nothing more; but , tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion , made such a rush at the jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him , had not her wrists been seized by sikes at the right moment; upon which , she made a few ineffectual struggles , and fainted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she s all right now , said sikes , laying her down in a corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she s uncommon strong in the arms , when she s up in this way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s the worst of having to do with women , said the jew , replacing his club;  - but they re clever , and we can t get on , in our line , without  em . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charley , show oliver to bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired charley bates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> master bates , apparently much delighted with his commission , took the cleft stick: and led oliver into an adjacent kitchen , where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here , with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter , he produced the identical old suit of clothes which oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow s; and the accidental display of which , to fagin , by the jew who purchased them , had been the very first clue received , of his whereabout . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - put off the smart ones , said charley ,  - and i ll give  em to fagin to take care of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what fun it is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor oliver unwillingly complied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> master bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm , departed from the room , leaving oliver in the dark , and locking the door behind him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the noise of charley s laughter , and the voice of miss betsy , who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend , and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery , might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which oliver was placed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hero sinks upon his straw bed , weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene , his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the actors in the mimic life of the theatre , are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling , which , presented before the eyes of mere spectators , are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as sudden shiftings of the scene , and rapid changes of time and place , are not only sanctioned in books by long usage , but are by many considered as the great art of authorship: an author s skill in his craft being , by such critics , chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter: this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if so , let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which oliver twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey , or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse - gate , and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps , up the high street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was an abstraction in his eye , an elevation in his air , which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle s mind , too great for utterance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand , and relaxed not in his dignified pace , until he reached the farm where mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bumble: having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one , and encased his person in a blue great - coat with a cape to it: took his place on the outside of the coach , accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom , in due course of time , he arrived in london . </s> </s>

<s> <s> putting a glass of hot gin - and - water on the chimney - piece , he drew his chair to the fire; and , with sundry moral reflections on the too - prevalent sin of discontent and complaining , composed himself to read the paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the very first paragraph upon which mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> to this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon , but rather evasive reply of  - i don t know; where do you come from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> poor dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i knew we should! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was certain of it . </s> </s>

<s> <s> having said this , the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again; and seating herself on a sofa , burst into tears . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms; inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and , after a few moments  reflection , commenced his story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would be tedious if given in the beadle s words: occupying , as it did , some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of it was , that oliver was a foundling , born of low and vicious parents . </s> </s>

<s> <s> folding his arms again , he then awaited mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> there were sad hearts at mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow s that night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about noon next day , when the dodger and master bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin took the opportunity of reading oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty , to no ordinary extent , in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends; and , still more , in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken oliver in , and cherished him , when , without his timely aid , he might have perished with hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom , in his philanthropy , he had succoured under parallel circumstances , but who , proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police , had unfortunately come to be hanged at the old bailey one morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe , but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong - headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question , had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown: which , if it were not precisely true , was indispensably necessary for the safety of him ( mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin ) and a few select friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and , with great friendliness and politeness of manner , expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit oliver twist to that unpleasant operation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> little oliver s blood ran cold , as he listened to the jew s words , and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , taking his hat , and covering himself with an old patched great - coat , he went out , and locked the room - door behind him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> which , never failing to revert to his kind friends , and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him , were sad indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after the lapse of a week or so , the jew left the room - door unlocked; and he was at liberty to wander about the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a very dirty place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from all of these tokens oliver concluded that a long time ago , before the old jew was born , it had belonged to better people , and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and dreary as it looked now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these exceptions , there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing; and often , when it grew dark , and he was tired of wandering from room to room , he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street - door , to be as near living people as he could; and would remain there , listening and counting the hours , until the jew or the boys returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in all the rooms , the mouldering shutters were fast closed: the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which was admitted , stealing its way through round holes at the top: which made the rooms more gloomy , and filled them with strange shadows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a back - garret window with rusty bars outside , which had no shutter; and out of this , oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops , blackened chimneys , and gable - ends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sometimes , indeed , a grizzly head might be seen , peering over the parapet - wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again; and as the window of oliver s observatory was nailed down , and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years , it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond , without making any attempt to be seen or heard ,which he had as much chance of being , as if he had lived inside the ball of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one afternoon , the dodger and master bates being engaged out that evening , the first - named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person ( to do him justice , this was by no means an habitual weakness with him ); and , with this end and aim , he condescendingly commanded oliver to assist him in his toilet , straightway . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some faces , however bad , to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he at once expressed his readiness; and , kneeling on the floor , while the dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps , he applied himself to a process which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dawkins designated as  - japanning his trotter - cases . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe , swinging one leg carelessly to and fro , and having his boots cleaned all the time , without even the past trouble of having taken them off , or the prospective misery of putting them on , to disturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the dodger , or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured , for the nonce , with a spice of romance and enthusiasm , foreign to his general nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he looked down on oliver , with a thoughtful countenance , for a brief space; and then , raising his head , and heaving a gentle sigh , said , half in abstraction , and half to master bates: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what a pity it is he isn t a prig! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said master charles bates;  - he don t know what s good for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dodger sighed again , and resumed his pipe: as did charley bates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the dodger mournfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s a the; you re one , are you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired oliver , checking himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am , replied the dodger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> so s fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so s sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so s nancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so s bet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he s the downiest one of the lot! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he wouldn t so much as bark in a witness - box , for fear of committing himself; no , not if you tied him up in one , and left him there without wittles for a fortnight , said the dodger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s a rum dog . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s an out - and - out christian , said charley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes  dog , there exist strong and singular points of resemblance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well , said the dodger , recurring to the point from which they had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this hasn t got anything to do with young green here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no more it has , said charley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why don t you put yourself under fagin , oliver? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and make your fortun  out of hand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> added the dodger , with a grin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and so be able to retire on your property , and do the gen - teel: as i mean to , in the very next leap - year but four that ever comes , and the forty - second tuesday in trinity - week , said charley bates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t like it , rejoined oliver , timidly;  - i wish they would let me go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> iiwould rather go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rejoined charley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the dodger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , where s your spirit? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t you take any pride out of yourself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , blow that! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you can leave your friends , though , said oliver with a half smile;  - and let them be punished for what you did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that , rejoined the dodger , with a wave of his pipe ,  - that was all out of consideration for fagin ,  cause the traps know that we work together , and he might have got into trouble if we hadn t made our lucky; that was the move , wasn t it , charley? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the dodger , drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what s the odds where it comes from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , catch hold; there s plenty more where they were took from . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you won t , won t you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , you precious flat! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired charley bates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he ll come to be scragged , won t he? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - something in this way , old feller , said charley . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he said it , master bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and , holding it erect in the air , dropped his head on his shoulder , and jerked a curious sound through his teeth; thereby indicating , by a lively pantomimic representation , that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i never did see such prime company as that  ere boy; he ll be the death of me , i know he will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you ve been brought up bad , said the dodger , surveying his boots with much satisfaction when oliver had polished them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fagin will make something of you , though , or you ll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you d better begin at once; for you ll come to the trade long before you think of it; and you re only losing time , oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and always put this in your pipe , nolly , said the dodger , as the jew was heard unlocking the door above ,  - if you don t take fogels and tickers<s> <s>  - what s the good of talking in that way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> interposed master bates;  - he don t know what you mean . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you don t take pocket - handkechers and watches , said the dodger , reducing his conversation to the level of oliver s capacity ,  - some other cove will; so that the coves that lose  em will be all the worse , and you ll be all the worse , too , and nobody half a ha p orth the better , except the chaps wot gets themand you ve just as good a right to them as they have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to be sure , to be sure! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the jew , who had entered unseen by oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell , take the dodger s word for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he understands the catechism of his trade . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man rubbed his hands gleefully together , as he corroborated the dodger s reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his pupil s proficiency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the conversation proceeded no farther at this time , for the jew had returned home accompanied by miss betsy , and a gentleman whom oliver had never seen before , but who was accosted by the dodger as tom chitling; and who , having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady , now made his appearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> chitling was older in years than the dodger: having perhaps numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his wardrobe was , in truth , rather out of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his  - time was only out an hour before; and that , in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past , he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be decidedly unlawful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty - two moral long hard - working days; and that he  - wished he might be busted if he warn t as dry as a lime - basket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the jew , with a grin , as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - iidon t know , sir , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired tom chitling , casting a contemptuous look at oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s in luck , then , said the young man , with a meaning look at fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never mind where i came from , young  un; you ll find your way there , soon enough , i ll bet a crown! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after some words apart between the last comer and fagin , they drew their chairs towards the fire; and the jew , telling oliver to come and sit by him , led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these were , the great advantages of the trade , the proficiency of the dodger , the amiability of charley bates , and the liberality of the jew himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> miss betsy accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from this day , oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys , who played the old game with the jew every day: whether for their own improvement or oliver s , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin best knew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , the wily old jew had the boy in his toils . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having prepared his mind , by solitude and gloom , to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place , he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it , and change its hue for ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a chill , damp , windy night , when the jew: buttoning his great - coat tight round his shrivelled body , and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face: emerged from his den . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure , and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible , slunk down the street as quickly as he could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the house to which oliver had been conveyed , was in the neighbourhood of whitechapel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and , glancing suspiciously round , crossed the road , and struck off in the direction of the spitalfields . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mud lay thick upon the stones , and a black mist hung over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly down , and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the jew to be abroad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he glided stealthily along , creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways , the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile , engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved: crawling forth , by night , in search of some rich offal for a meal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he hurried through several alleys and streets , and at length turned into one , lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the door of a house in this street , he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it , he walked upstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a dog growled as he touched the handle of a room - door; and a man s voice demanded who was there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bring in your body then , said sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lie down , you stupid brute! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> apparently , the dog had been somewhat deceived by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin s outer garment; for as the jew unbuttoned it , and threw it over the back of a chair , he retired to the corner from which he had risen: wagging his tail as he went , to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , my dear , replied the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception; for mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she took her feet off the fender , pushed back her chair , and bade fagin draw up his , without saying more about it: for it was a cold night , and no mistake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is cold , nancy dear , said the jew , as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems to go right through one , added the old man , touching his side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it must be a piercer , if it finds its way through your heart , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it s enough to turn a man ill , to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way , like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - quite enough , quite , thankye , bill , replied the jew , putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you re afraid of our getting the better of you , are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired sikes , fixing his eyes on the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ugh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a hoarse grunt of contempt , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes seized the glass , and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself: which he did at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , said sikes , smacking his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now i m ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for business? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for business , replied sikes;  - so say what you ve got to say . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - or he won t , and that s the same thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> speak out , and call things by their right names; don t sit there , winking and blinking , and talking to me in hints , as if you warn t the very first that thought about the robbery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wot d ye mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush , bill , hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the jew , who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation;  - somebody will hear us , my dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> somebody will hear us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let  em hear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sikes;  - i don t care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes did care , on reflection , he dropped his voice as he said the words , and grew calmer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , there , said the jew , coaxingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was only my caution , nothing more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when is it to be done? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the jew: rubbing his hands , and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not at all , replied sikes coldly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not to be done at all! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> echoed the jew , leaning back in his chair . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - who are you that s not to be told? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i tell you that toby crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight , and he can t get one of the servants in line . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you mean to tell me , bill , said the jew: softening as the other grew heated:  - that neither of the two men in the house can be got over? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i do mean to tell you so , replied sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the old lady has had  em these twenty years; and if you were to give  em five hundred pound , they wouldn t be in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not by flash toby crackit? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - think what women are , bill ,<s> <s>  - no; not even by flash toby crackit , replied sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he says he s worn sham whiskers , and a canary waistcoat , the whole blessed time he s been loitering down there , and it s all of no use . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers , my dear , said the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so he did , rejoined sikes ,  - and they warn t of no more use than the other plant . </s> </s>

<s> <s> after ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast , he raised his head and said , with a deep sigh , that if flash toby crackit reported aright , he feared the game was up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and yet , said the old man , dropping his hands on his knees ,  - it s a sad thing , my dear , to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so it is , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - worse luck! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a long silence ensued; during which the jew was plunged in deep thought , with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes eyed him furtively from time to time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nancy , apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker , sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire , as if she had been deaf to all that passed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fagin , said sikes , abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed;  - is it worth fifty shiners extra , if it s safely done from the outside? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it a bargain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said sikes , thrusting aside the jew s hand , with some disdain ,  - let it come off as soon as you like . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> toby and me were over the garden - wall the night afore last , sounding the panels of the door and shutters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which is that , bill? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - umph! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried sikes , stopping short , as the girl , scarcely moving her head , looked suddenly round , and pointed for an instant to the jew s face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never mind which part it is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can t do it without me , i know; but it s best to be on the safe side when one deals with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as you like , my dear , as you like replied the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - none , said sikes ,  -  cept a centre - bit and a boy . </s> </s>

<s> <s> sikes , his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs ,  - so they go on; and , if they d got money enough ( which it s a providence they haven t , ) we shouldn t have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade , in a year or two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no more we should , acquiesced the jew , who had been considering during this speech , and had only caught the last sentence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bill! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently , as if he thought the precaution unnecessary; but complied , nevertheless , by requesting miss nancy to fetch him a jug of beer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you don t want any beer , said nancy , folding her arms , and retaining her seat very composedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nonsense , rejoined the girl coolly ,  - go on , fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know what he s going to say , bill; he needn t mind me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew still hesitated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked at length . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i didn t know whether she mightn t p r aps be out of sorts , you know , my dear , as she was the other night , replied the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this confession , miss nancy burst into a loud laugh; and , swallowing a glass of brandy , shook her head with an air of defiance , and burst into sundry exclamations of  - keep the game a - going! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never say die! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes likewise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , fagin , said nancy with a laugh . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - have him , bill! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said nancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he mayn t be so much up , as any of the others; but that s not what you want , if he s only to open a door for you . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i know he is , rejoined fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s been in good training these last few weeks , and it s time he began to work for his bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , the others are all too big . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , he is just the size i want , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , ruminating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and will do everything you want , bill , my dear , interposed the jew;  - he can t help himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - frighten him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> echoed sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it ll be no sham frightening , mind you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you won t see him alive again , fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> think of that , before you send him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the robber , poising a crowbar , which he had drawn from under the bedstead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ve thought of it all , said the jew with energy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i vei ve had my eye upon him , my dears , closeclose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once let him feel that he is one of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and he s ours! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oho! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it couldn t have come about better! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and , drawing his head and shoulders into a heap , literally hugged himself for joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ours! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps i do , my dear , said the jew , with a shrill chuckle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and wot , said sikes , scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend ,  - wot makes you take so much pains about one chalk - faced kid , when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about common garden every night , as you might pick and choose from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because they re of no use to me , my dear , replied the jew , with some confusion ,  - not worth the taking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> besides , said the jew , recovering his self - possession ,  - he has us now if he could only give us leg - bail again; and he must be in the same boat with us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never mind how he came there; it s quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery; that s all i want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , how much better this is , than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the waywhich would be dangerous , and we should lose by it besides . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when is it to be done? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked nancy , stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah , to be sure , said the jew;  - when is it to be done , bill? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good , said the jew;  - there s no moon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s all arranged about bringing off the swag , is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes nodded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never mind particulars . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then you hold your tongue , and keep the melting - pot ready , and that s all you ll have to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was also solemnly arranged that poor oliver should , for the purposes of the contemplated expedition , be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> these preliminaries adjusted , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , in a fit of professional enthusiasm , he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools: which he had no sooner stumbled in with , and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained , and the peculiar beauties of their construction , than he fell over the box upon the floor , and went to sleep where he fell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - night , nancy , said the jew , muffling himself up as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their eyes met , and the jew scrutinised her , narrowly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no flinching about the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was as true and earnest in the matter as toby crackit himself could be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew again bade her good - night , and , bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes while her back was turned , groped downstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> muttered the jew to himself as he turned homeward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the worst of these women is , that a very little thing serves to call up some long - forgotten feeling; and , the best of them is , that it never lasts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man against the child , for a bag of gold! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin wended his way , through mud and mire , to his gloomy abode: where the dodger was sitting up , impatiently awaiting his return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hours ago , replied the dodger , throwing open a door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here he is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tomorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when oliver awoke in the morning , he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes , with strong thick soles , had been placed at his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at first , he was pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled , on his sitting down to breakfast along with the jew , who told him , in a tone and manner which increased his alarm , that he was to be taken to the residence of bill sikes that night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - totostop there , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , my dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t be afraid , oliver , you shall come back to us again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man , who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread , looked round as he bantered oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i suppose , said the jew , fixing his eyes on oliver ,  - you want to know what you re going to bill s foreh , my dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver coloured , involuntarily , to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts; but boldly said , yes , he did want to know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , do you think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired fagin , parrying the question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - indeed i don t know , sir , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the jew , turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy s face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew seemed much vexed by oliver s not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject; but the truth is , that , although oliver felt very anxious , he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of fagin s looks , and his own speculations , to make any further inquiries just then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had no other opportunity: for the jew remained very surly and silent till night: when he prepared to go abroad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may burn a candle , said the jew , putting one upon the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and here s a book for you to read , till they come to fetch you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good - night! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - night! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver looked up; the jew , pointing to the candle , motioned him to light it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he did so; and , as he placed the candlestick upon the table , saw that the jew was gazing fixedly at him , with lowering and contracted brows , from the dark end of the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take heed , oliver! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the old man , shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s a rough man , and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mind! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> placing a strong emphasis on the last word , he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin , and , nodding his head , left the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared , and pondered , with a trembling heart , on the words he had just heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was too well accustomed to suffering , and had suffered too much where he was , to bewail the prospect of change very severely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained lost in thought for some minutes; and then , with a heavy sigh , snuffed the candle , and , taking up the book which the jew had left with him , began to read . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he turned over the leaves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> carelessly at first; but , lighting on a passage which attracted his attention , he soon became intent upon the volume . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down , deep as they were , but had yielded them up at last , after many years , and so maddened the murderers with the sight , that in their horror they had confessed their guilt , and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , too , he read of men who , lying in their beds at dead of night , had been tempted ( so they said ) and led on , by their own bad thoughts , to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep , and the limbs quail , to think of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , falling upon his knees , he prayed heaven to spare him from such deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once , than be reserved for crimes , so fearful and appalling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by degrees , he grew more calm , and besought , in a low and broken voice , that he might be rescued from his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred , it might come to him now , when , desolate and deserted , he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had concluded his prayer , but still remained with his head buried in his hands , when a rustling noise aroused him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s that! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried , starting up , and catching sight of a figure standing by the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who s there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only me , replied a tremulous voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was nancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it hurts my eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver saw that she was very pale , and gently inquired if she were ill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl threw herself into a chair , with her back towards him: and wrung her hands; but made no reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - god forgive me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - has anything happened? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - can i help you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nancy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried oliver ,  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver stirred the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for no harm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t believe it , said oliver: who had watched her closely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have it your own way , rejoined the girl , affecting to laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver could see that he had some power over the girl s better feelings , and , for an instant , thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the reflection occured to him , he stepped forward: and said , somewhat hastily , that he was ready . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> neither his brief consideration , nor its purport , was lost on his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the girl , stooping over him , and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are hedged round and round . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> struck by the energy of her manner , oliver looked up in her face with great surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was white and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have saved you from being ill - used once , and i will again , and i do now , continued the girl aloud;  - for those who would have fetched you , if i had not , would have been far more rough than me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have promised for your being quiet and silent; if you are not , you will only do harm to yourself and me too , and perhaps be my death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - remember this! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and don t let me suffer more for you , just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they don t mean to harm you; whatever they make you do , is no fault of yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every word from you is a blow for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your hand! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she caught the hand which oliver instinctively placed in hers , and , blowing out the light , drew him after her up the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door was opened , quickly , by some one shrouded in the darkness , and was as quickly closed , when they had passed out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a hackney - cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing oliver , the girl pulled him in with her , and drew the curtains close . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the driver wanted no directions , but lashed his horse into full speed , without the delay of an instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl still held oliver fast by the hand , and continued to pour into his ear , the warnings and assurances she had already imparted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for one brief moment , oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street , and a cry for help hung upon his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he hesitated , the opportunity was gone; he was already in the house , and the door was shut . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this way , said the girl , releasing her hold for the first time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs , with a candle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was a very strong expression of approbation , an uncommonly hearty welcome , from a person of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nancy , appearing much gratified thereby , saluted him cordially . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bull s - eye s gone home with tom , observed sikes , as he lighted them up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s right , rejoined nancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so you ve got the kid , said sikes when they had all reached the room: closing the door as he spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did he come quiet? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - like a lamb , rejoined nancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i m glad to hear it , said sikes , looking grimly at oliver;  - for the sake of his young carcase: as would otherways have suffered for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come here , young  un; and let me read you a lectur  , which is as well got over at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes pulled off oliver s cap and threw it into a corner; and then , taking him by the shoulder , sat himself down by the table , and stood the boy in front of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , first: do you know wot this is? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired sikes , taking up a pocket - pistol which lay on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , look here , continued sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to; and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes proceeded to load the pistol , with great nicety and deliberation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now it s loaded , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , when he had finished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i see it is , sir , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the robber , grasping oliver s wrist , and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the boy could not repress a start;  - if you speak a word when you re out o doors with me , except when i speak to you , that loading will be in your head without notice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , if you do make up your mind to speak without leave , say your prayers first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning , to increase its effect , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes continued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as near as i know , there isn t anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you , if you was disposed of; so i needn t take this devil - and - all of trouble to explain matters to you , if it warn t for your own good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , approvingly;  - women can always put things in fewest words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now that he s thoroughly up to it , let s have some supper , and get a snooze before starting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in pursuance of this request , nancy quickly laid the cloth; disappearing for a few minutes , she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep s heads: which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , the worthy gentleman , stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service , was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof , it may be here remarked , that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught , and did not utter , on a rough calculation , more than four - score oaths during the whole progress of the meal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water , and threw himself on the bed; ordering nancy , with many imprecations in case of failure , to call him at five precisely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver stretched himself in his clothes , by command of the same authority , on a mattress upon the floor; and the girl , mending the fire , sat before it , in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning , and it was quite dark outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> growled sikes , as oliver started up;  - half - past five! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nancy , scarcely looking at the boy , threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat; sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus attired , he gave his hand to the robber , who , merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side - pocket of his great - coat , clasped it firmly in his , and , exchanging a farewell with nancy , led him away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the night had been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the kennels were overflowing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene: the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded , without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house - tops , and dreary streets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed , were noiseless and empty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the time they had turned into the bethnal green road , the day had fairly begun to break . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many of the lamps were already extinguished; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on , towards london; now and then , a stage - coach , covered with mud , rattled briskly by: the driver bestowing , as he passed , an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who , by keeping on the wrong side of the road , had endangered his arriving at the office , a quarter of a minute after his time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by degrees , other shops began to be unclosed , and a few scattered people were met with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they approached the city , the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between shoreditch and smithfield , it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was as light as it was likely to be , till night came on again , and the busy morning of half the london population had begun . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> turning down sun street and crown street , and crossing finsbury square , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes struck , by way of chiswell street , into barbican: thence into long lane , and so into smithfield; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled oliver twist with amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ground was covered , nearly ankle - deep , with filth and mire; a thick steam , perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle , and mingling with the fog , which seemed to rest upon the chimney - tops , hung heavily above . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the pens in the centre of the large area , and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space , were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen , three or four deep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , dragging oliver after him , elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd , and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds , which so astonished the boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he nodded , twice or thrice , to a passing friend; and , resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram , pressed steadily onward , until they were clear of the turmoil , and had made their way through hosier lane into holborn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sikes , looking up at the clock of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andrew s church ,  - hard upon seven! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must step out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing  - hounslow written on it , he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume , if he would give them a lift as far as isleworth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes; he s my boy , replied sikes , looking hard at oliver , and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your father walks rather too quick for you , don t he , my man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the driver: seeing that oliver was out of breath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s used to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , take hold of my hand , ned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in with you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus addressing oliver , he helped him into the cart; and the driver , pointing to a heap of sacks , told him to lie down there , and rest himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they passed the different mile - stones , oliver wondered , more and more , where his companion meant to take him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> kensington , hammersmith , chiswick , kew bridge , brentford , were all passed; and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , they came to a public - house called the coach and horses; a little way beyond which , another road appeared to run off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and here , the cart stopped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes dismounted with great precipitation , holding oliver by the hand all the while; and lifting him down directly , bestowed a furious look upon him , and rapped the side - pocket with his fist , in a significant manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good - bye , boy , said the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s sulky , replied sikes , giving him a shake;  - he s sulky . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a young dog! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t mind him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not i! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rejoined the other , getting into his cart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he drove away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they turned round to the left , a short way past the public - house; and then , taking a right - hand road , walked on for a long time: passing many large gardens and gentlemen s houses on both sides of the way , and stopping for nothing but a little beer , until they reached a town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here against the wall of a house , oliver saw written up in pretty large letters ,  - hampton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length they came back into the town; and , turning into an old public - house with a defaced sign - board , ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they took no notice of oliver; and very little of sikes; and , as sikes took very little notice of them , he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves , without being much troubled by their company . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , you re going on to lower halliford , are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i am , replied the man , who seemed a little the worseor better , as the case might befor drinking;  - and not slow about it neither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my horse hasn t got a load behind him going back , as he had coming up in the mornin ; and he won t be long a - doing of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ecod! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you going to halliford? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is all paid , becky? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , the other gentleman s paid , replied the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i say! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the man , with tipsy gravity;  - that won t do , you know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rejoined sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you re a - going to accommodate us , and wot s to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so , in return? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger reflected upon this argument , with a very profound face; having done so , he seized sikes by the hand: and declared he was a real good fellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes replied , he was joking; as , if he had been sober , there would have been strong reason to suppose he was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after the exchange of a few more compliments , they bade the company good - night , and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so , and lounging out to the door , with her hands full , to see the party start . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the horse , whose health had been drunk in his absence , was standing outside: ready harnessed to the cart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , the hostler was told to give the horse his head; and , his head being given him , he made a very unpleasant use of it: tossing it into the air with great disdain , and running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing those feats , and supporting himself for a short time on his hind - legs , he started off at great speed , and rattled out of the town right gallantly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the night was very dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a damp mist rose from the river , and the marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy; and sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver sat huddled together , in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees , whose branches waved grimly to and fro , as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a light in the ferry - house window opposite: which streamed across the road , and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew - tree with graves beneath it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sunbury was passed through , and they came again into the lonely road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they turned into no house at shepperton , as the weary boy had expected; but still kept walking on , in mud and darkness , through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes , until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on looking intently forward , oliver saw that the water was just below them , and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes kept straight on , until they were close upon the bridge; then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the water! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door yielded to the pressure , and they passed in together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hallo! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried a loud , hoarse voice , as soon as they set foot in the passage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t make such a row , said sikes , bolting the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the same voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a glim , barney , a glim! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> show the gentleman in , barney; wake up first , if convenient . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the speaker appeared to throw a boot - jack , or some such article , at the person he addressed , to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of a wooden body , falling violently , was heard; and then an indistinct muttering , as of a man between sleep and awake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you hear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the same voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there s bill sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there , as if you took laudanum with your meals , and nothing stronger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bister sikes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or i shall tread upon your heels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> muttering a curse upon his tardiness , sikes pushed oliver before him; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire , two or three broken chairs , a table , and a very old couch: on which , with his legs much higher than his head , a man was reposing at full length , smoking a long clay pipe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> crackit ( for he it was ) had no very great quantity of hair , either upon his head or face; but what he had , was of a reddish dye , and tortured into long corkscrew curls , through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers , ornamented with large common rings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a trifle above the middle size , and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top - boots , which he contemplated , in their elevated situation , with lively satisfaction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bill , my boy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said this figure , turning his head towards the door ,  - i m glad to see you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> toby crackit brought himself into a sitting posture , and demanded who that was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only the boy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wud of bister fagid s lads , exclaimed barney , with a grin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fagin s , eh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed toby , looking at oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wot an inwalable boy that ll make , for the old ladies  pockets in chapels! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his mug is a fortin  to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - therethere s enough of that , interposed sikes , impatiently; and stooping over his recumbant friend , he whispered a few words in his ear: at which mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> crackit laughed immensely , and honoured oliver with a long stare of astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said sikes , as he resumed his seat ,  - if you ll give us something to eat and drink while we re waiting , you ll put some heart in us; or in me , at all events . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sit down by the fire , younker , and rest yourself; for you ll have to go out with us again tonight , though not very far off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver looked at sikes , in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool to the fire , sat with his aching head upon his hands , scarcely knowing where he was , or what was passing around him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here , said toby , as the young jew placed some fragments of food , and a bottle upon the table ,  - success to the crack! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he rose to honour the toast; and , carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner , advanced to the table , filled a glass with spirits , and drank off its contents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes did the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a drain for the boy , said toby , half - filling a wine - glass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think i don t know what s good for you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell him to drink it , bill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he had better! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men , oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass , and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing: which delighted toby crackit and barney , and even drew a smile from the surly mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this done , and sikes having satisfied his appetite ( oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow ) , the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they slept , or appeared to sleep , for some time; nobody stirring but barney , who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver fell into a heavy doze: imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes , or wandering about the dark churchyard , or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day: when he was roused by toby crackit jumping up and declaring it was half - past one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls , and drew on their great - coats; barney , opening a cupboard , brought forth several articles , which he hastily crammed into the pockets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - barkers for me , barney , said toby crackit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you loaded them yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all right! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied toby , stowing them away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the persuaders? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ve got  em , replied sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - crape , keys , centre - bits , darkiesnothing forgotten? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired toby: fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all right , rejoined his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these words , he took a thick stick from barney s hands , who , having delivered another to toby , busied himself in fastening on oliver s cape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now then! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sikes , holding out his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise , and the air , and the drink which had been forced upon him: put his hand mechanically into that which sikes extended for the purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take his other hand , toby , said sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look out , barney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man went to the door , and returned to announce that all was quiet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two robbers issued forth with oliver between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was now intensely dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp , that , although no rain fell , oliver s hair and eyebrows , within a few minutes after leaving the house , had become stiff with the half - frozen moisture that was floating about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they crossed the bridge , and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - slap through the town , whispered sikes;  - there ll be nobody in the way , tonight , to see us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little town , which at that late hour was wholly deserted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had cleared the town , as the church - bell struck two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> quickening their pace , they turned up a road upon the left hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after walking about a quarter of a mile , they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall: to the top of which , toby crackit , scarcely pausing to take breath , climbed in a twinkling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the boy next , said toby . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he clasped his hands together , and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a mist came before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured sikes , trembling with rage , and drawing the pistol from his pocket;  - get up , or i ll strew your brains upon the grass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried oliver;  - let me run away and die in the fields . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pray have mercy on me , and do not make me steal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the man;  - it won t answer here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> say another word , and i ll do your business myself with a crack on the head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that makes no noise , and is quite as certain , and more genteel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ve seen older hands of his age took the same way , for a minute or two , on a cold night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , invoking terrific imprecations upon fagin s head for sending oliver on such an errand , plied the crowbar vigorously , but with little noise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a little lattice window , about five feet and a half above the ground , at the back of the house: which belonged to a scullery , or small brewing - place , at the end of the passage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the aperture was so small , that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of oliver s size , nevertheless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a very brief exercise of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now listen , you young limb , whispered sikes , drawing a dark lantern from his pocket , and throwing the glare full on oliver s face;  - i m a going to put you through there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you , and along the little hall , to the street door; unfasten it , and let us in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stand upon one of the hall chairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are three there , bill , with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on  em: which is the old lady s arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - keep quiet , can t you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied sikes , with a threatening look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wide , replied toby , after peeping in to satisfy himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> barney  ticed him away tonight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so neat! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper , and laughed without noise , sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent , and to get to work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take this lantern , said sikes , looking into the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you see the stairs afore you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , pointing to the street - door with the pistol - barrel , briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered , he would fall dead that instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s done in a minute , said sikes , in the same low whisper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hark! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whispered the other man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing , said sikes , releasing his hold of oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the short time he had had to collect his senses , the boy had firmly resolved that , whether he died in the attempt or not , he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall , and alarm the family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> filled with this idea , he advanced at once , but stealthily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come back! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly cried sikes aloud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - back! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cry was repeateda light appeareda vision of two terrified half - dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyesa flasha loud noisea smokea crash somewhere , but where he knew not ,and he staggered back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again , and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he fired his own pistol after the men , who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give me a shawl here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they ve hit him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> quick! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then came the loud ringing of a bell , mingled with the noise of fire - arms , and the shouts of men , and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , the noises grew confused in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy s heart; and he saw or heard no more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bleak , dark , and piercing cold , it was a night for the well - housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank god they were at home; and for the homeless , starving wretch to lay him down and die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many hunger - worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets , at such times , who , let their crimes have been what they may , can hardly open them in a more bitter world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such was the aspect of out - of - doors affairs , when mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she glanced from the table to the fireplace , where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice , her inward satisfaction evidently increased ,so much so , indeed , that mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> corney smiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the matron , leaning her elbow on the table , and looking reflectively at the fire;  - i m sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> corney shook her head mournfully , as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver spoon ( private property ) into the inmost recesses of a two - ounce tin tea - caddy , proceeded to make the tea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the black teapot , being very small and easily filled , ran over while mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> corney s hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - drat the pot! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> corney , pausing ,  - except to a poor desolate creature like me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these words , the matron dropped into her chair , and , once more resting her elbow on the table , thought of her solitary fate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> corney ( who had not been dead more than five - and - twenty years ); and she was overpowered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall never get another! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> corney , pettishly;  - i shall never get anotherlike him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether this remark bore reference to the husband , or the teapot , is uncertain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it might have been the latter; for mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> corney looked at it as she spoke; and took it up afterwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had just tasted her first cup , when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room - door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , come in with you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - some of the old women dying , i suppose . </s> </s>

<s> <s> bumble? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - at your service , ma am , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean , and to shake the snow off his coat; and who now made his appearance , bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall i shut the door , ma am? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lady modestly hesitated to reply , lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , with closed doors . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles!   very good ,  says our overseer , taking  em away again , you won t get anything else here . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - well , that is a good one , too! </s> </s>

<s> <s> this is the port wine , ma am , that the board ordered for the infirmary; real , fresh , genuine port wine; only out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell , and no sediment! </s> </s>

<s> <s> the flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces , and made their ugliness appear terrible , as , in this position , they began to converse in a low voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did she say any more , anny dear , while i was gone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the messenger . </s> </s>

<s> <s> while they were thus employed , the matron , who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor , joined them by the fire , and sharply asked how long she was to wait? </s> </s>

<s> <s> on being excluded , the old ladies changed their tone , and cried through the keyhole that old sally was drunk; which , indeed , was not unlikely; since , in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary , she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin - and - water which had been privily administered , in the openness of their hearts , by the worthy old ladies themselves . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - be quick , or it may be too late! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the mother , said the woman , making a more violent effort than before;  - the mother , when the pains of death first came upon her , whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive , and thrived , the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and oh , kind heaven!   she said , folding her thin hands together , whether it be boy or girl , raise up some friends for it in this troubled world , and take pity upon a lonely desolate child , abandoned to its mercy!  <s> <s>  - the boy s name? </s> </s>

<s> <s> she was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew back , instinctively , as she once again rose , slowly and stiffly , into a sitting posture; then , clutching the coverlid with both hands , muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat , and fell lifeless on the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and nothing to tell , after all , rejoined the matron , walking carelessly away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two crones , to all appearance , too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply , were left alone , hovering about the body . </s> </s>

<s> <s> indeed , the artful , presuming upon their close attachment , more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances , master bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to be  - blowed , or to insert his head in a sack , or replying with some other neatly - turned witticism of a similar kind , the happy application of which , excited considerable admiration in the mind of mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost; and that the circumstance , so far from angering master bates , appeared to afford him the highest amusement , inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal , and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days . </s> </s>

<s> <s> either the matter or the manner of this remark , which was made very ruefully , delighted charley bates so much , that his consequent shout of laughter roused the jew from his reverie , and induced him to inquire what was the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - matter , fagin! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wish you had watched the play . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tommy chitling hasn t won a point; and i went partners with him against the artful and dumb . </s> </s>

<s> <s> lively , after ineffectually standing on tiptoe , in the hope of catching sight of him , again forced himself into the little chair , and , exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop , in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled , resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour . </s> </s>

<s> <s> merely making a sign to a man at the bar , fagin walked straight upstairs , and opening the door of a room , and softly insinuating himself into the chamber , looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with his hand , as if in search of some particular person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the room was illuminated by two gas - lights; the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters , and closely - drawn curtains of faded red , from being visible outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ceiling was blackened , to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke , that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by degrees , however , as some of it cleared away through the open door , an assemblage of heads , as confused as the noises that greeted the ear , might be made out; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene , the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company , male and female , crowded round a long table: at the upper end of which , sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose , and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache , presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as fagin stepped softly in , the professional gentleman , running over the keys by way of prelude , occasioned a general cry of order for a song; which having subsided , a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses , between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through , as loud as he could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when this was over , the chairman gave a sentiment , after which , the professional gentleman on the chairman s right and left volunteered a duet , and sang it , with great applause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was the chairman himself , ( the landlord of the house , ) a coarse , rough , heavy built fellow , who , while the songs were proceeding , rolled his eyes hither and thither , and , seeming to give himself up to joviality , had an eye for everything that was done , and an ear for everything that was saidand sharp ones , too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> near him were the singers: receiving , with professional indifference , the compliments of the company , and applying themselves , in turn , to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water , tendered by their more boisterous admirers; whose countenances , expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade , irresistibly attracted the attention , by their very repulsiveness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> succeeding , at length , in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair , he beckoned to him slightly , and left the room , as quietly as he had entered it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what can i do for you , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin? </s> </s>

<s> <s> as he is not here , tomorrow will be time enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing more? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not a word now , said the jew , descending the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i say , said the other , looking over the rails , and speaking in a hoarse whisper;  - what a time this would be for a sell! </s> </s>

<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlord reciprocated the old man s laugh; and returned to his guests . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew was no sooner alone , than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - now , muttered the jew , as he knocked at the door ,  - if there is any deep play here , i shall have it out of you , my girl , cunning as you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl was alone; lying with her head upon the table , and her hair straggling over it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she has been drinking , thought the jew , cooly ,  - or perhaps she is only miserable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man turned to close the door , as he made this reflection; the noise thus occasioned , roused the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position , shuffled her feet upon the ground; but this was all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> apparently satisfied with his inspection , he coughed twice or thrice , and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl moaned out some half intelligible reply , that she could not tell; and seemed , from the smothered noise that escaped her , to be crying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor leetle child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> left in a ditch , nance; only think! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the jew , in amazement . </s> </s>

<s> <s> a moment before , his clenched hands had grasped the air; his eyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now , he shrunk into a chair , and , cowering together , trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a short silence , he ventured to look round at his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> croaked the jew , in his usual voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you mind me , dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has done many a good job for you , and will do many more when he can; and when he can t he won t; so no more about that . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you put me up for a minute; but now i m stupid again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her disordered appearance , and a wholesale perfume of geneva which pervaded the apartment , afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the jew s supposition; and when , after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described , she subsided , first into dullness , and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the influence of which she shed tears one minute , and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of  - never say die! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin , who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time , saw , with great satisfaction , that she was very far gone indeed . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the weather being dark , and piercing cold , he had no great temptation to loiter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it blew from the right quarter for the jew , however , and straight before it he went: trembling , and shivering , as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had reached the corner of his own street , and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door - key , when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow , and , crossing the road , glided up to him unperceived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fagin! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whispered a voice close to his ear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the jew , turning quickly round ,  - is that<s> <s>  - yes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> interrupted the stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have been lingering here these two hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where the devil have you been? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on your business , my dear , replied the jew , glancing uneasily at his companion , and slackening his pace as he spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , of course! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well; and what s come of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing good , said the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the stranger , stopping short , and turning a startled look on his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and , indeed , muttered something about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner , he unlocked the door , and requested him to close it softly , while he got a light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s as dark as the grave , said the man , groping forward a few steps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shut the door , whispered fagin from the end of the passage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he spoke , it closed with a loud noise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that wasn t my doing , said the other man , feeling his way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the wind blew it to , or it shut of its own accord: one or the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look sharp with the light , or i shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a short absence , he returned with a lighted candle , and the intelligence that toby crackit was asleep in the back room below , and that the boys were in the front one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> beckoning the man to follow him , he led the way upstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we can say the few words we ve got to say in here , my dear , said the jew , throwing open a door on the first floor;  - and as there are holes in the shutters , and we never show lights to our neighbours , we ll set the candle on the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with those words , the jew , stooping down , placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs , exactly opposite to the room door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they conversed for some time in whispers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there , a listener might easily have perceived that fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they might have been talking , thus , for a quarter of an hour or more , when monksby which name the jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquysaid , raising his voice a little ,<s> <s>  - i tell you again , it was badly planned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why not have kept him here among the rest , and made a sneaking , snivelling pickpocket of him at once? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - haven t you done it , with other boys , scores of times? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whose turn would that have served , my dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the jew humbly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but not mine , said the jew , submissively . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he might have become of use to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i saw it was not easy to train him to the business , replied the jew;  - he was not like other boys in the same circumstances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - curse him , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i had no hold upon him to make him worse , pursued the jew , anxiously watching the countenance of his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his hand was not in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the beginning , or we labour in vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what could i do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> send him out with the dodger and charley? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that was not my doing , observed monks . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - throttle the girl! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monks , impatiently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , we can t afford to do that just now , my dear , replied the jew , smiling;  - and , besides , that sort of thing is not in our way; or , one of these days , i might be glad to have it done . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the shadow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw the shadow of a woman , in a cloak and bonnet , pass along the wainscot like a breath! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew released his hold , and they rushed tumultuously from the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they listened intently: a profound silence reigned throughout the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s your fancy , said the jew , taking up the light and turning to his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied monks , trembling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was bending forward when i saw it first; and when i spoke , it darted away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate , and , telling him he could follow , if he pleased , ascended the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they looked into all the rooms; they were cold , bare , and empty . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - besides ourselves , there s not a creature in the house except toby and the boys; and they re safe enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as a proof of the fact , the jew drew forth two keys from his pocket; and explained , that when he first went downstairs , he had locked them in , to prevent any intrusion on the conference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this accumulated testimony effectually staggered mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he declined any renewal of the conversation , however , for that night: suddenly remembering that it was past one o clock . </s> </s>

<s> <s> if parliament don t take their abominable courses under consideration , this country s ruined , and the character of the peasantry gone for ever! </s> </s>

<s> <s> and now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home , and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman s funeral , let us set on foot a few inquires after young oliver twist , and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where toby crackit left him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as sikes growled forth this imprecation , with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of , he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head , for an instant , to look back at his pursuers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was little to be made out , in the mist and darkness; but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air , and the barking of the neighbouring dogs , roused by the sound of the alarm bell , resounded in every direction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stop , you white - livered hound! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the robber , shouting after toby crackit , who , making the best use of his long legs , was already ahead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol - shot; and sikes was in no mood to be played with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bear a hand with the boy , cried sikes , beckoning furiously to his confederate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come back! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> toby made a show of returning; but ventured , in a low voice , broken for want of breath , to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - quicker! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment the noise grew louder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , again looking round , could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this parting advice , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> crackit , preferring the chance of being shot by his friend , to the certainty of being taken by his enemies , fairly turned tail , and darted off at full speed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form of oliver , the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along the front of the hedge , as if to distract the attention of those behind , from the spot where the boy lay; paused , for a second , before another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol high into the air , cleared it at a bound , and was gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ho , ho , there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pincher! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> neptune! </s> </s>

<s> <s> the dogs , who , in common with their masters , seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged , readily answered to the command . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shouldn t wish to appear ill - mannered , gentlemen , said the third , who had called the dogs back ,  - mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> giles says , it isn t our place to contradict him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thank my stars , i know my sitiwation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to tell the truth , the little man did seem to know his situation , and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i an t , said brittles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are , said giles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , said brittles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you re a lie , brittles , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , these four retorts arose from mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the third man brought the dispute to a close , most philosophically . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll tell you what it is , gentlemen , said he ,  - we re all afraid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - speak for yourself , sir , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , who was the palest of the party . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so am i , said brittles;  - only there s no call to tell a man he is , so bounceably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these frank admissions softened mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , who at once owned that he was afraid; upon which , they all three faced about , and ran back again with the completest unanimity , until mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles ( who had the shortest wind of the party , as was encumbered with a pitchfork ) most handsomely insisted on stopping , to make an apology for his hastiness of speech . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , when he had explained ,  - what a man will do , when his blood is up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should have committed murderi know i shouldif we d caught one of them rascals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as their blood , like his , had all gone down again; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know what it was , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles;  - it was the gate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shouldn t wonder if it was , exclaimed brittles , catching at the idea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may depend upon it , said giles ,  - that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i felt all mine suddenly going away , as i was climbing over it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by a remarkable coincidence , the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was quite obvious , therefore , that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place , because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars , and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse , and who had been roused , together with his two mongrel curs , to join in the pursuit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> encouraging each other with such converse as this; but , keeping very close together , notwithstanding , and looking apprehensively round , whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried back to a tree , behind which they had left their lantern , lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> catching up the light , they made the best of their way home , at a good round trot; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible , the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance , like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the air grew colder , as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where sikes had left him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morning drew on apace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the air became more sharp and piercing , as its first dull huethe death of night , rather than the birth of dayglimmered faintly in the sky . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rain came down , thick and fast , and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , oliver felt it not , as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched , helpless and unconscious , on his bed of clay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering it , the boy awoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was so weak , that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture; when he had done so , he looked feebly round for help , and groaned with pain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> trembling in every joint , from cold and exhaustion , he made an effort to stand upright; but , shuddering from head to foot , fell prostrate on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged , oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart , which seemed to warn him that if he lay there , he must surely die: got upon his feet , and essayed to walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his head was dizzy , and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he kept up , nevertheless , and , with his head drooping languidly on his breast , went stumbling onward , he knew not whither . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now , hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus he staggered on , creeping , almost mechanically , between the bars of gates , or through hedge - gaps as they came in his way , until he reached a road . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here the rain began to fall so heavily , that it roused him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he looked about , and saw that at no great distance there was a house , which perhaps he could reach . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pitying his condition , they might have compassion on him; and if they did not , it would be better , he thought , to die near human beings , than in the lonely open fields . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he summoned up all his strength for one last trial , and bent his faltering steps towards it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that garden wall! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the grass inside , he had fallen on his knees last night , and prayed the two men s mercy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place , that , for the instant , he forgot the agony of his wound , and thought only of flight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> flight! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he could scarcely stand: and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame , whither could he fly? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he pushed against the garden - gate; it was unlocked , and swung open on its hinges . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and , his whole strength failing him , sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened that about this time , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , brittles , and the tinker , were recruiting themselves , after the fatigues and terrors of the night , with tea and sundries , in the kitchen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not that it was mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants: towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability , which , while it gratified , could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender , leaning his left arm on the table , while , with his right , he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery , to which his hearers ( but especially the cook and housemaid , who were of the party ) listened with breathless interest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was about half - past two , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles ,  - or i wouldn t swear that it mightn t have been a little nearer three , when i woke up , and , turning round in my bed , as it might be so , ( here mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles turned round in his chair , and pulled the corner of the table - cloth over him to imitate bed - clothes , ) i fancied i heerd a noise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this point of the narrative the cook turned pale , and asked the housemaid to shut the door: who asked brittles , who asked the tinker , who pretended not to hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - heerd a noise , continued mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what sort of a noise? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a kind of a busting noise , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , looking round him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg - grater , suggested brittles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was , when you heerd it , sir , rejoined mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i turned down the clothes; continued giles , rolling back the table - cloth ,  - sat up in bed; and listened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and drew their chairs closer together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i heerd it now , quite apparent , resumed mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - somebody ,  i says , is forcing of a door , or window; what s to be done? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ll call up that poor lad , brittles , and save him from being murdered in his bed; or his throat ,  i says , may be cut from his right ear to his left , without his ever knowing it . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> here , all eyes were turned upon brittles , who fixed his upon the speaker , and stared at him , with his mouth wide open , and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i tossed off the clothes , said giles , throwing away the table - cloth , and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid ,  - got softly out of bed; drew on a pair of<s> <s>  - ladies present , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , murmured the tinker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of shoes , sir , said giles , turning upon him , and laying great emphasis on the word;  - seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate - basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brittles ,  i says , when i had woke him , don t be frightened!  <s> <s>  - so you did , observed brittles , in a low voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we re dead men , i think , brittles ,  i says , continued giles;  - but don t be frightened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the cook . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not a bit of it , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he was as firmah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pretty near as firm as i was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should have died at once , i m sure , if it had been me , observed the housemaid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you re a woman , retorted brittles , plucking up a little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - brittles is right , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , nodding his head , approvingly;  - from a woman , nothing else was to be expected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we , being men , took a dark lantern that was standing on brittle s hob , and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark ,as it might be so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cook and housemaid screamed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was a knock , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , assuming perfect serenity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , surveying the pale faces which surrounded him , and looking very blank himself;  - but the door must be opened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you hear , somebody? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , as he spoke , looked at brittles; but that young man , being naturally modest , probably considered himself nobody , and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events , he tendered no reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the women were out of the question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , after a short silence ,  - i am ready to make one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so am i , said the tinker , waking up , as suddenly as he had fallen asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat re - assured by the discovery ( made on throwing open the shutters ) that it was now broad day , took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the advice of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , they all talked very loud , to warn any evil - disposed person outside , that they were strong in numbers; and by a master - stoke of policy , originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman , the dogs  tails were well pinched , in the hall , to make them bark savagely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these precautions having been taken , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles held on fast by the tinker s arm ( to prevent his running away , as he pleasantly said ) , and gave the word of command to open the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brittles obeyed; the group , peeping timorously over each other s shoulders , beheld no more formidable object than poor little oliver twist , speechless and exhausted , who raised his heavy eyes , and mutely solicited their compassion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a boy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s the matter with theeh? whybrittleslook heredon t you know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , seizing the boy by one leg and one arm ( fortunately not the broken limb ) lugged him straight into the hall , and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bawled giles , calling in a state of great excitement , up the staircase;  - here s one of the thieves , ma am! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wounded , miss! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shot him , miss; and brittles held the light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two women - servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore oliver , lest he should die before he could be hanged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the midst of all this noise and commotion , there was heard a sweet female voice , which quelled it in an instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - giles! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whispered the voice from the stair - head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i m here , miss , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t be frightened , miss; i ain t much injured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he didn t make a very desperate resistance , miss! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was soon too many for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied the young lady;  - you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is the poor creature much hurt? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wounded desperate , miss , replied giles , with indescribable complacency . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he looks as if he was a - going , miss , bawled brittles , in the same manner as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wouldn t you like to come and look at him , miss , in case he should? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush , pray; there s a good man! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rejoined the lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but won t you take one look at him , first , miss? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not one little peep , miss? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not now , for the world , replied the young lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor fellow! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , bending over oliver , he helped to carry him upstairs , with the care and solicitude of a woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of old - fashioned comfort , than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a well - spread breakfast - table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black , was in attendance upon them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of the two ladies , one was well advanced in years; but the high - backed oaken chair in which she sat , was not more upright than she . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dressed with the utmost nicety and precision , in a quaint mixture of by - gone costume , with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste , which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect , she sat , in a stately manner , with her hands folded on the table before her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her eyes ( and age had dimmed but little of their brightness ) were attentively upon her young companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring - time of womanhood; at that age , when , if ever angels be for god s good purposes enthroned in mortal forms , they may be , without impiety , supposed to abide in such as hers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her element , nor its rough creatures her fit companions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her , she playfully put back her hair , which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look , such an expression of affection and artless loveliness , that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the old lady , after a pause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an hour and twelve minutes , ma am , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , referring to a silver watch , which he drew forth by a black ribbon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is always slow , remarked the old lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - brittles always was a slow boy , ma am , replied the attendant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and seeing , by the bye , that brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years , there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he gets worse instead of better , i think , said the elder lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles and the breakfast - table together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the fat gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mayliebless my soulin the silence of the night , tooi never heard of such a thing! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these expressions of condolence , the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies , and drawing up a chair , inquired how they found themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why didn t you send? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dear , dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so unexpected! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the silence of the night , too! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected , and attempted in the night - time; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon , and to make an appointment , by post , a day or two previous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> very much so , indeed , said rose , interrupting him;  - but there is a poor creature upstairs , whom aunt wishes you to see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to be sure , replied the doctor ,  - so there is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that was your handiwork , giles , i understand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , who had been feverishly putting the tea - cups to rights , blushed very red , and said that he had had that honour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - honour , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the doctor;  - well , i don t know; perhaps it s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen , as to hit your man at twelve paces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fancy that he fired in the air , and you ve fought a duel , giles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gad , that s true! </s> </s>

<s> <s> well , i couldn t have believed it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne , a surgeon in the neighbourhood , known through a circuit of ten miles round as  - the doctor , had grown fat , more from good - humour than from good living: and was as kind and hearty , and withal as eccentric an old bachelor , as will be found in five times that space , by any explorer alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor was absent , much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie , said the doctor , standing with his back to the door , as if to keep it shut . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is not in danger , i hope? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , that would not be an extraordinary thing , under the circumstances , replied the doctor;  - though i don t think he is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you seen the thief? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , rejoined the old lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nor heard anything about him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i beg your pardon , ma am , interposed mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles;  - but i was going to tell you about him when doctor losberne came in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fact was , that mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> maylie ,  - but i wouldn t hear of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rejoined the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is nothing very alarming in his appearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have you any objection to see him in my presence? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i think it is necessary , said the doctor;  - at all events , i am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so , if you postponed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> allow memiss rose , will you permit me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal , the doctor drew the young lady s arm through one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie , led them , with much ceremony and stateliness , upstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said the doctor , in a whisper , as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom - door ,  - let us hear what you think of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has not been shaved very recently , but he don t look at all ferocious notwithstanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stepping before them , he looked into the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> motioning them to advance , he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand , and looked on , for a minute or so , in silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whilst he was watching the patient thus , the younger lady glided softly past , and seating herself in a chair by the bedside , gathered oliver s hair from his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , a strain of gentle music , or the rippling of water in a silent place , or the odour of a flower , or the mention of a familiar word , will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were , in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence , long gone by , would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what can this mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - vice , said the surgeon , replacing the curtain ,  - takes up her abode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shall not enshrine her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but at so early an age! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> urged rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear young lady , rejoined the surgeon , mournfully shaking his head;  - crime , like death , is not confined to the old and withered alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , can youoh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the surgeon shook his head , in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient , led the way into an adjoining apartment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but even if he has been wicked , pursued rose ,  - think how young he is; think that he may never have known a mother s love , or the comfort of a home; that ill - usage and blows , or the want of bread , may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as you love me , and know that i have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection , but that i might have done so , and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child , have pity upon him before it is too late! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear love , said the elder lady , as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom ,  - do you think i would harm a hair of his head? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied rose , eagerly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , surely , said the old lady;  - my days are drawing to their close: and may mercy be shown to me as i show it to others! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me think , ma am , said the doctor;  - let me think . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles , and that little boy , brittles , i can manage it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant , i know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways , and reward him for being such a good shot besides . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unless there is some other way of preserving the child , replied mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is no other , said the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no other , take my word for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you seem to think , retorted the doctor ,  - that everybody is disposed to be hard - hearted today , except yourself , miss rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i only hope , for the sake of the rising male sex generally , that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft - hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion; and i wish i were a young fellow , that i might avail myself , on the spot , of such a favourable opportunity for doing so , as the present . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , said the doctor , laughing heartily ,  - that is no very difficult matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to return to this boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the great point of our agreement is yet to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he will wake in an hour or so , i dare say; and although i have told that thick - headed constable - fellow downstairs that he musn t be moved or spoken to , on peril of his life , i think we may converse with him without danger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now i make this stipulationthat i shall examine him in your presence , and that , if , from what he says , we judge , and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason , that he is a real and thorough bad one ( which is more than possible ) , he shall be left to his fate , without any farther interference on my part , at all events . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> entreated rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it a bargain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very good , retorted the doctor;  - then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait , with some impatience , until oliver should awake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on , and still oliver slumbered heavily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the boy was very ill , he said , and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something , that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity , than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning: which he should otherwise have done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the conference was a long one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt calm and happy , and could have died without a murmur . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and finding nobody about the parlours , it occurred to him , that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he went . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the latter gentleman had a large staff , a large head , large features , and large half - boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of aleas indeed he had . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - misses wished some ale to be given out , sir; and as i felt no ways inclined for my own little room , sir , and was disposed for company , i am taking mine among  em here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - how is the patient tonight , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , trembling ,  - that he s going to die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i thought it , i should never be happy again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wouldn t cut a boy off: no , not even brittles here; not for all the plate in the county , sir . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - and what are you , boy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then tell me this , said the doctor ,  - both of you , both of you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are you going to take upon yourselves to swear , that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we are prepared for you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pay attention to the reply , constable , will you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the doctor , shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner , and tapping the bridge of his nose with it , to bespeak the exercise of that worthy s utmost acuteness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - something may come of this before long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s what it is , sir , replied the constable , coughing with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry , and some of it had gone the wrong way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here s the house broken into , said the doctor ,  - and a couple of men catch one moment s glimpse of a boy , in the midst of gunpowder smoke , and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here s a boy comes to that very same house , next morning , and because he happens to have his arm tied up , these men lay violent hands upon himby doing which , they place his life in great dangerand swear he is the thief . </s> </s>

<s> <s> giles looked doubtfully at brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear , to catch the reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate , and at the same moment , the sound of wheels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s the runners! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried brittles , to all appearance much relieved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the bow street officers , sir , replied brittles , taking up a candle;  - me and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles sent for  em this morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , replied brittles;  - i sent a message up by the coachman , and i only wonder they weren t here before , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you did , did you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who s that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired brittles , opening the door a little way , with the chain up , and peeping out , shading the candle with his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - open the door , replied a man outside;  - it s the officers from bow street , as was sent to today . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> much comforted by this assurance , brittles opened the door to its full width , and confronted a portly man in a great - coat; who walked in , without saying anything more , and wiped his shoes on the mat , as coolly as if he lived there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just send somebody out to relieve my mate , will you , young man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the officer;  - he s in the gig , a - minding the prad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brittles replying in the affirmative , and pointing out the building , the portly man stepped back to the garden - gate , and helped his companion to put up the gig: while brittles lighted them , in a state of great admiration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this done , they returned to the house , and , being shown into a parlour , took off their great - coats and hats , and showed like what they were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man who had knocked at the door , was a stout personage of middle height , aged about fifty: with shiny black hair , cropped pretty close; half - whiskers , a round face , and sharp eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other was a red - headed , bony man , in top - boots; with a rather ill - favoured countenance , and a turned - up sinister - looking nose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell your governor that blathers and duff is here , will you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the stouter man , smoothing down his hair , and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good - evening , master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> can i have a word or two with you in private , if you please? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is the lady of the house , said mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> maylie . </s> </s>

<s> <s> messrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i can t say , for certain , till i see the work , of course , said blathers;  - but my opinion at once is ,i don t mind committing myself to that extent ,that this wasn t done by a yokel; eh , duff? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and , translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies , i apprehend your meaning to be , that this attempt was not made by a countryman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne , with a smile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s it , master , replied blathers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is all about the robbery , is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all , replied the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , what is this , about this here boy that the servants are a - talking on? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing at all , replied the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head , that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it s nonsense: sheer absurdity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wery easy disposed of , if it is , remarked duff . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what he says is quite correct , observed blathers , nodding his head in a confirmatory way , and playing carelessly with the handcuffs , as if they were a pair of castanets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what account does he give of himself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where did he come from? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he didn t drop out of the clouds , did he , master? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course not , replied the doctor , with a nervous glance at the two ladies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know his whole history: but we can talk about that presently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you would like , first , to see the place where the thieves made their attempt , i suppose? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - certainly , rejoined mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> blathers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we had better inspect the premises first , and examine the servants afterwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lights were then procured; and messrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> blathers and duff , attended by the native constable , brittles , giles , and everybody else in short , went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn , and looked in at the window; and after that , had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after that , a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that , a pitchfork to poke the bushes with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this done , amidst the breathless interest of all beholders , they came in again; and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this consummation being arrived at , blathers and duff cleared the room , and held a long council together , compared with which , for secrecy and solemnity , a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine , would be mere child s play . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie and rose looked on , with anxious faces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon my word , he said , making a halt , after a great number of very rapid turns ,  - i hardly know what to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - surely , said rose ,  - the poor child s story , faithfully repeated to these men , will be sufficient to exonerate him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i doubt it , my dear young lady , said the doctor , shaking his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is he , after all , they would say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a runaway . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you believe it , surely? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> interrupted rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on his own showing , you see , he has been the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a police - officer , on a charge of picking a gentleman s pocket; he has been taken away , forcibly , from that gentleman s house , to a place which he cannot describe or point out , and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is brought down to chertsey , by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him , whether he will or no; and is put through a window to rob a house; and then , just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates , and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights , there rushes into the way , a blundering dog of a half - bred butler , and shoots him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t you see all this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see it , of course , replied rose , smiling at the doctor s impetuosity;  - but still i do not see anything in it , to criminate the poor child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied the doctor;  - of course not! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bless the bright eyes of your sex! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they never see , whether for good or bad , more than one side of any question; and that is , always , the one which first presents itself to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having given vent to this result of experience , the doctor put his hands into his pockets , and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am certain it will not be believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end , still the dragging it forward , and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it , must interfere , materially , with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what is to be done? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dear , dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why did they send for these people? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , indeed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would not have had them here , for the world . </s> </s>

<s> <s> losberne , at last: sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness ,  - that we must try and carry it off with a bold face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the object is a good one , and that must be our excuse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come in! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , master , said blathers , entering the room followed by his colleague , and making the door fast , before he said any more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this warn t a put - up thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded the doctor , impatiently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we call it a put - up robbery , ladies , said blathers , turning to them , as if he pitied their ignorance , but had a contempt for the doctor s ,  - when the servants is in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nobody suspected them , in this case , said mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> we ll see this lad that you ve got upstairs at once , if you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - perhaps they will take something to drink first , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the doctor: his face brightening , as if some new thought had occurred to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to be sure! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed rose , eagerly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you shall have it immediately , if you will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , thank you , miss! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - a little drop of spirits , master , if it s all the same , replied blathers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s a cold ride from london , ma am; and i always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this interesting communication was addressed to mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he was wery quick about it . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the devil it is! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hallo , there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me out! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , before the coachman could dismount from his box , he had tumbled out of the coach , by some means or other; and , running down to the deserted tenement , began kicking at the door like a madman . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - there ll be murder the matter , too , replied the hump - backed man , coolly ,  - if you don t take your hands off . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - stupid enough , this , muttered the doctor to himself;  - the boy must have made a mistake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man followed to the chariot door , uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way; but as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he continued to utter the most fearful imprecations , until the driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their way , they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the ground , and tearing his hair , in transports of real or pretended rage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - an ass , said the doctor again , after a further silence of some minutes . </s> </s>

<s> <s> if the truth must be told , he was a little out of temper , for a minute or two , at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of oliver s story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she presently returned , and said , that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow had sold off his goods , and gone to the west indies , six weeks before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver clasped his hands , and sank feebly backward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne , after a moment s pause . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the old gentleman , the housekeeper , and a gentleman who was a friend of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow s , all went together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then turn towards home again , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne to the driver;  - and don t stop to bait the horses , till you get out of this confounded london! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - quite enough for both of us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no; home again straight! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and in obedience to the doctor s impulse , home they went . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this bitter disappointment caused oliver much sorrow and grief , even in the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself , many times during his illness , with thinking of all that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him , and in bewailing his cruel separation from them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hope of eventually clearing himself with them , too , and explaining how he had been forced away , had buoyed him up , and sustained him , under many of his recent trials; and now , the idea that they should have gone so far , and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robbera belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying daywas almost more than he could bear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sending the plate , which had so excited fagin s cupidity , to the banker s; and leaving giles and another servant in care of the house , they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country , and took oliver with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who can describe the pleasure and delight , the peace of mind and soft tranquillity , the sickly boy felt in the balmy air , and among the green hills and rich woods , of an inland village! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men who have lived in crowded , pent - up streets , through lives of toil , and who have never wished for change; men , to whom custom has indeed been second nature , and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even they , with the hand of death upon them , have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of nature s face; and , carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures , have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the memories which peaceful country scenes call up , are not of this world , nor of its thoughts and hopes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts , and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this , there lingers , in the least reflective mind , a vague and half - formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before , in some remote and distant time , which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come , and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a lovely spot to which they repaired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver , whose days had been spent among squalid crowds , and in the midst of noise and brawling , seemed to enter on a new existence there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees; and the garden - flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hard by , was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones , but full of humble mounds , covered with fresh turf and moss: beneath which , the old people of the village lay at rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver often wandered here; and , thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay , would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen; but , when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead , he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground , and would weep for her , sadly , but without pain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a happy time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the days were peaceful and serene; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched prison , or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> every morning he went to a white - headed old gentleman , who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better , and to write: and who spoke so kindly , and took such pains , that oliver could never try enough to please him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie and rose , and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them , in some shady place , and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could have done , until it grew too dark to see the letters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this , he would work hard , in a little room which looked into the garden , till evening came slowly on , when the ladies would walk out again , and he with them: listening with such pleasure to all they said: and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach , or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when it became quite dark , and they returned home , the young lady would sit down to the piano , and play some pleasant air , or sing , in a low and gentle voice , some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and oliver would sit by one of the windows , listening to the sweet music , in a perfect rapture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and when sunday came , how differently the day was spent , from any way in which he had ever spent it yet! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was the little church , in the morning , with the green leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds singing without: and the sweet - smelling air stealing in at the low porch , and filling the homely building with its fragrance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poor people were so neat and clean , and knelt so reverently in prayer , that it seemed a pleasure , not a tedious duty , their assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude , it was real , and sounded more musical ( to oliver s ears at least ) than any he had ever heard in church before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the morning , oliver would be a - foot by six o clock , roaming the fields , and plundering the hedges , far and wide , for nosegays of wild flowers , with which he would return laden , home; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange , to the best advantage , for the embellishment of the breakfast - table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was fresh groundsel , too , for miss maylie s birds , with which oliver , who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk , would decorate the cages , in the most approved taste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so three months glided away; three months which , in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals , might have been unmingled happiness , and which , in oliver s were true felicity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest , warmest , soul - felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that , by the end of that short time , oliver twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece , and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart , was repaid by their pride in , and attachment to , himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the great trees , which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months , had now burst into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground , converted open and naked spots into choice nooks , where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect , steeped in sunshine , which lay stretched beyond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver had long since grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was still the same gentle , attached , affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength , and when he was dependent for every slight attention , and comfort on those who tended him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one beautiful night , when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them: for the day had been unusually warm , and there was a brilliant moon , and a light wind had sprung up , which was unusually refreshing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose had been in high spirits , too , and they had walked on , in merry conversation , until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - rose , my dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the elder lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose made no reply , but played a little quicker , as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - rose , my love! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie , rising hastily , and bending over her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in tears! </s> </s>

<s> <s> interposed mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , not ill! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied rose: shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her , while she spoke;  - i shall be better presently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver hastened to comply with her request . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young lady , making an effort to recover her cheerfulness , strove to play some livelier tune; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> covering her face with her hands , she sank upon a sofa , and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the elderly lady , folding her arms about her ,  - i never saw you so before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would not alarm you if i could avoid it , rejoined rose;  - but indeed i have tried very hard , and cannot help this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> its expression had lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face , which it had never worn before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another minute , and it was suffused with a crimson flush: and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> again this disappeared , like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly pale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver , who watched the old lady anxiously , observed that she was alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth , was he; but seeing that she affected to make light of them , he endeavoured to do the same , and they so far succeeded , that when rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night , she was in better spirits; and appeared even in better health: assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning , quite well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope , said oliver , when mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie returned ,  - that nothing is the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she don t look well tonight , but<s> <s> the old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room , remained silent for some time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope not , oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it may be time that i should meet with some misfortune; but i hope it is not this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s>

<s> <s> god forbid! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed oliver , hastily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - amen to that , my child! </s> </s>

<s> <s> maylie;  - and will be worse , i am sure . </s> </s>

<s> <s> she gave way to such great grief , that oliver , suppressing his own emotion , ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg , earnestly , that , for the sake of the dear young lady herself , she would be more calm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and consider , ma am , said oliver , as the tears forced themselves into his eyes , despite of his efforts to the contrary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> consider how young and good she is , and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her . </s> </s>

<s> <s> maylie , laying her hand on oliver s head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you think like a child , poor boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but you teach me my duty , notwithstanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had forgotten it for a moment , oliver , but i hope i may be pardoned , for i am old , and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god s will be done! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i love her; and he knows how well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie said these words , she checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she spoke , became composed and firm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that , under all the care and watching which ensued , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie was ever ready and collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her , steadily , and , to all external appearances , even cheerfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he was young , and did not know what strong minds are capable of , under trying circumstances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an anxious night ensued . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when morning came , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie s predictions were but too well verified . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we must be active , oliver , and not give way to useless grief , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie , laying her finger on her lip , as she looked steadily into his face;  - this letter must be sent , with all possible expedition , to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it must be carried to the market - town: which is not more than four miles off , by the footpath across the field: and thence dispatched , by an express on horseback , straight to chertsey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver could make no reply , but looked his anxiety to be gone at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here is another letter , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie , pausing to reflect;  - but whether to send it now , or wait until i see how rose goes on , i scarcely know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired oliver; impatient to execute his commission , and holding out his trembling hand for the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied the old lady , giving it to him mechanically . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver glanced at it , and saw that it was directed to harry maylie , esquire , at some great lord s house in the country; where , he could not make out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - shall it go , ma am? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked oliver , looking up , impatiently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think not , replied mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will wait until tomorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these words , she gave oliver her purse , and he started off , without more delay , at the greatest speed he could muster . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> swiftly he ran across the fields , and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either side , and now emerging on an open field , where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work: nor did he stop once , save now and then , for a few seconds , to recover breath , until he came , in a great heat , and covered with dust , on the little market - place of the market - town . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who , after hearing what he wanted , referred him to the ostler; who after hearing all he had to say again , referred him to the landlord; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth , a white hat , drab breeches , and boots with tops to match , leaning against a pump by the stable - door , picking his teeth with a silver toothpick . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill: which took a long time making out: and after it was ready , and paid , a horse had to be saddled , and a man to be dressed , which took up ten good minutes more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety , that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself , and galloped away , full tear , to the next stage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for , and that no time had been lost , oliver hurried up the inn - yard , with a somewhat lighter heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what the devil s this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> muttered the man to himself , glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grind him to ashes! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he d start up from a stone coffin , to come in my way! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am sorry , stammered oliver , confused by the strange man s wild look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope i have not hurt you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - rot you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> murmured the man , in a horrible passion; between his clenched teeth;  - if i had only had the courage to say the word , i might have been free of you in a night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> curses on your head , and black death on your heart , you imp! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are you doing here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he advanced towards oliver , as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him , but fell violently on the ground: writhing and foaming , in a fit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver gazed , for a moment , at the struggles of the madman ( for such he supposed him to be ); and then darted into the house for help . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having seen him safely carried into the hotel , he turned his face homewards , running as fast as he could , to make up for lost time: and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear , the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long , however: for when he reached the cottage , there was enough to occupy his mind , and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - in fact , he said ,  - it would be little short of a miracle , if she recovered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how often did a tremble shake his frame , and cold drops of terror start upon his brow , when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of , had even then occurred! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered , compared with those he poured forth , now , in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature , who was tottering on the deep grave s verge! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the suspense , the fearful , acute suspense , of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love , is trembling in the balance! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind , and make the heart beat violently , and the breath come thick , by the force of the images they conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety to be doing something to relieve the pain , or lessen the danger , which we have no power to alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit , which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections or endeavours can , in the full tide and fever of the time , allay them! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> people spoke in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate , from time to time; women and children went away in tears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the livelong day , and for hours after it had grown dark , oliver paced softly up and down the garden , raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber , and shuddering to see the darkened window , looking as if death lay stretched inside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne arrived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is hard , said the good doctor , turning away as he spoke;  - so young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care; and , with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her; with life , and health , and sounds and sights of joy , surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay , wasting fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver crept away to the old churchyard , and sitting down on one of the green mounds , wept and prayed for her , in silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook , careering overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that , when the boy raised his aching eyes , and looked about , the thought instinctively occurred to him , that this was not a time for death; that rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter: not for sunlight and fragrance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was tolling for the funeral service . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a group of humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse was young . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mothera mother onceamong the weeping train . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the sun shone brightly , and the birds sang on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver turned homeward , thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady , and wishing that the time could come again , that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had no cause for self - reproach on the score of neglect , or want of thought , for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him , on which he fancied he might have been more zealous , and more earnest , and wished he had been . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures , let us remember this , in time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he reached home mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie was sitting in the little parlour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep , from which she would waken , either to recovery and life , or to bid them farewell , and die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they sat , listening , and afraid to speak , for hours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the untasted meal was removed , with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere , they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower , and , at length , cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the old lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me at once! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i can bear it; anything but suspense! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , tell me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the name of heaven! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be calm , my dear ma am , pray . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me go , in god s name! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my dear child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is dead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is dying! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the doctor , passionately . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as he is good and merciful , she will live to bless us all , for years to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the lady fell upon her knees , and tried to fold her hands together; but the energy which had supported her so long , fled up to heaven with her first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was almost too much happiness to bear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep , or speak , or rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed , until , after a long ramble in the quiet evening air , a burst of tears came to his relief , and he seemed to awaken , all at once , to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred , and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he walked briskly along the road , he heard behind him , the noise of some vehicle , approaching at a furious pace . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> looking round , he saw that it was a post - chaise , driven at great speed; and as the horses were galloping , and the road was narrow , he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as it dashed on , oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap , whose face seemed familiar to him , although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oliver , what s the news? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> master o - li - ver! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it you , giles? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried oliver , running up to the chaise - door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles popped out his nightcap again , preparatory to making some reply , when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise , and who eagerly demanded what was the news . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in a word! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the gentleman ,  - better or worse? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied oliver , hastily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank heaven! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - quite , sir , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the change took place only a few hours ago; and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne says , that all danger is at an end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gentleman said not another word , but , opening the chaise - door , leaped out , and taking oliver hurriedly by the arm , led him aside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are quite certain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no possibility of any mistake on your part , my boy , is there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not deceive me , by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne s words were , that she would live to bless us all for many years to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tears stood in oliver s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away , and remained silent , for some minutes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver thought he heard him sob , more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remarkfor he could well guess what his feelings wereand so stood apart , feigning to be occupied with his nosegay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this time , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion , was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman , when he turned round and addressed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think you had better go on to my mother s in the chaise , giles , said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would rather walk slowly on , so as to gain a little time before i see her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i beg your pardon , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> harry , said giles: giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief;  - but if you would leave the postboy to say that , i should be very much obliged to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it wouldn t be proper for the maids to see me in this state , sir; i should never have any more authority with them if they did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let him go on with the luggage , if you wish it , and do you follow with us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering , or we shall be taken for madmen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , reminded of his unbecoming costume , snatched off and pocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat , of grave and sober shape , which he took out of the chaise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie , and oliver , followed at their leisure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he seemed about five - and - twenty years of age , and was of the middle height; his countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> notwithstanding the difference between youth and age , he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady , that oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship , if he had not already spoken of her as his mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i did , replied mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie;  - but , on reflection , i determined to keep back the letter until i had heard mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne s opinion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but why , said the young man ,  - why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if rose hadi cannot utter that word nowif this illness had terminated differently , how could you ever have forgiven yourself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how could i ever have know happiness again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who can wonder if it be so , mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rejoined the young man;  - or why should i say , if? it isit isyou know it , motheryou must know it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i did not feel this , and know , besides , that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart , i should not feel my task so difficult of performance , or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom , when i take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you still suppose that i am a boy ignorant of my own mind , and mistaking the impulses of my own soul? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie , laying her hand upon his shoulder ,  - that youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and that among them are some , which , being gratified , become only the more fleeting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mother , said the young man , impatiently ,  - he would be a selfish brute , unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe , who acted thus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on rose , sweet , gentle girl! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my heart is set , as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have no thought , no view , no hope in life , beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake , you take my peace and happiness in your hands , and cast them to the wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mother , think better of this , and of me , and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - harry , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie ,  - it is because i think so much of warm and sensitive hearts , that i would spare them from being wounded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but we have said enough , and more than enough , on this matter , just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let it rest with rose , then , interposed harry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will not press these overstrained opinions of yours , so far , as to throw any obstacle in my way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was the impatient reply;  - mother , i have considered , years and years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have considered , ever since i have been capable of serious reflection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she shall , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is something in your manner , which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly , mother , said the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not coldly , rejoined the old lady;  - far from it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> urged the young man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she has formed no other attachment? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , indeed , replied his mother;  - you have , or i mistake , too strong a hold on her affections already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that i leave you to discover , replied mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god bless you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall see you again tonight? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the young man , eagerly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by and by , replied the lady;  - when i leave rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will tell her i am here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course , replied mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you will not refuse to do this , mother? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and pressing her son s hand , affectionately , she hastened from the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne and oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the former now held out his hand to harry maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the doctor then communicated , in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend , a precise account of his patient s situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise , as oliver s statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , who affected to be busy about the luggage , listened with greedy ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you shot anything particular , lately , giles? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing particular , sir , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , colouring up to the eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nor catching any thieves , nor identifying any house - breakers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the boy is very well , sir , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , recovering his usual tone of patronage;  - and sends his respectful duty , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s well , said the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - seeing you here , reminds me , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles walked into the corner with much importance , and some wonder , and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor , on the termination of which , he made a great many bows , and retired with steps of unusual stateliness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour , but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it; for mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this , the two women - servants lifted up their hands and eyes , and supposed that mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles , pulling out his shirt - frill , replied ,  - no , no; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors , he would thank them to tell him so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then he made a great many other remarks , no less illustrative of his humility , which were received with equal favour and applause , and were , withal , as original and as much to the purpose , as the remarks of great men commonly are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> above stairs , the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful harry maylie might have been at first , he was not proof against the worthy gentleman s good humour , which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections , and an abundance of small jokes , which struck oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard , and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor , who laughed immoderately at himself , and made harry laugh almost as heartily , by the very force of sympathy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , they were as pleasant a party as , under the circumstances , they could well have been; and it was late before they retired , with light and thankful hearts , to take that rest of which , after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone , they stood much in need . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver rose next morning , in better heart , and went about his usual occupations , with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the birds were once more hung out , to sing , in their old places; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found , were once more gathered to gladden rose with their beauty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts , exercise , even over the appearance of external objects . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men who look on nature , and their fellow - men , and cry that all is dark and gloomy , are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the real hues are delicate , and need a clearer vision . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> harry maylie , after the very first morning when he met oliver coming laden home , was seized with such a passion for flowers , and displayed such a taste in their arrangement , as left his young companion far behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if oliver were behindhand in these respects , he knew where the best were to be found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together , and brought home the fairest that blossomed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the window of the young lady s chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in , and revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in water , just inside the lattice , one particular little bunch , which was made up with great care , every morning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away , although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor , could he help observing , that whenever the doctor came into the garden , he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner , and nodded his head most expressively , as he set forth on his morning s walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he applied himself , with redoubled assiduity , to the instructions of the white - headed old gentleman , and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the little room in which he was accustomed to sit , when busy at his books , was on the ground - floor , at the back of the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one beautiful evening , when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth , oliver sat at this window , intent upon his books . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had been poring over them for some time; and , as the day had been uncommonly sultry , and he had exerted himself a great deal , it is no disparagement to the authors , whoever they may have been , to say , that gradually and by slow degrees , he fell asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes , which , while it holds the body prisoner , does not free the mind from a sense of things about it , and enable it to ramble at its pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so far as an overpowering heaviness , a prostration of strength , and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion , can be called sleep , this is it; and yet , we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us , and , if we dream at such a time , words which are really spoken , or sounds which really exist at the moment , accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions , until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver knew , perfectly well , that he was in his own little room; that his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet he was asleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly , the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he thought , with a glow of terror , that he was in the jew s house again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there sat the hideous old man , in his accustomed corner , pointing at him , and whispering to another man , with his face averted , who sat beside him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush , my dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thought he heard the jew say;  - it is he , sure enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other man seemed to answer;  - could i mistake him , think you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape , and he stood amongst them , there is something that would tell me how to point him out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you buried him fifty feet deep , and took me across his grave , i fancy i should know , if there wasn t a mark above it , that he lay buried there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man seemed to say this , with such dreadful hatred , that oliver awoke with the fear , and started up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good heaven! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and beside him , white with rage or fear , or both , were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn - yard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the inmates of the house , attracted by oliver s cries , hurried to the spot from which they proceeded , they found him , pale and agitated , pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house , and scarcely able to articulate the words ,  - the jew! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the jew! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but harry maylie , whose perceptions were something quicker , and who had heard oliver s history from his mother , understood it at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what direction did he take? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , they are in the ditch! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said harry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne , who had been out walking , and just then returned , tumbled over the hedge after them , and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess , struck into the same course at no contemptible speed , shouting all the while , most prodigiously , to know what was the matter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe , until the leader , striking off into an angle of the field indicated by oliver , began to search , narrowly , the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up; and for oliver to communicate to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were not even the traces of recent footsteps , to be seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they stood now , on the summit of a little hill , commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was the village in the hollow on the left; but , in order to gain that , after pursuing the track oliver had pointed out , the men must have made a circuit of open ground , which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it must have been a dream , oliver , said harry maylie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i saw them both , as plainly as i see you now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who was the other? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne , together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the very same man i told you of , who came so suddenly upon me at the inn , said oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they took this way? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded harry:  - are you sure? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as i am that the men were at the window , replied oliver , pointing down , as he spoke , to the hedge which divided the cottage - garden from the meadow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two gentlemen watched oliver s earnest face , as he spoke , and looking from him to each other , seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still , in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the grass was long; but it was trodden down nowhere , save where their own feet had crushed it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of men s shoes , or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is strange! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said harry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - strange? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> echoed the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search , they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless; and even then , they gave it up with reluctance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of these , the jew was , at all events , sufficiently remarkable to be remembered , supposing he had been seen drinking , or loitering about; but giles returned without any intelligence , calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the next day , fresh search was made , and the inquiries renewed; but with no better success . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie repaired to the market - town , in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had left her room: was able to go out; and mixing once more with the family , carried joy into the hearts of all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage; there was at times , an unwonted restraint upon some there: even upon rose herself: which oliver could not fail to remark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , one morning , when rose was alone in the breakfast - parlour , harry maylie entered; and , with some hesitation , begged permission to speak with her for a few moments . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she merely bowed; and bending over some plants that stood near , waited in silence for him to proceed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - iiought to have left here , before , said harry . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - forgive me for saying so , but i wish you had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was brought here , by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions , said the young man;  - the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed . </s> </s>

<s> <s> that the best and fairest of our kind , too often fade in blooming . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl , as these words were spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent , and glistened brightly in its cup , making it more beautiful , it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart , claimed kindred naturally , with the loveliest things in nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a creature , continued the young man , passionately ,  - a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of god s own angels , fluttered between life and death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who could hope , when the distant world to which she was akin , half opened to her view , that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose , rose , to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow , which a light from above , casts upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray , amid all these consolations , that you might be restored to those who loved youthese were distractions almost too great to bear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were mine , by day and night; and with them , came such a rushing torrent of fears , and apprehensions , and selfish regrets , lest you should die , and never know how devotedly i loved you , as almost bore down sense and reason in its course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> day by day , and almost hour by hour , some drop of health came back , and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you , swelled it again to a high and rushing tide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - rose , my own dear rose! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that time has not arrived; but here , with not fame won , and no young vision realised , i offer you the heart so long your own , and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your behaviour has ever been kind and noble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as you believe that i am not insensible or ungrateful , so hear my answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is , that i may endeavour to deserve you; it is , dear rose? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is , replied rose ,  - that you must endeavour to forget me; not as your old and dearly - attached companion , for that would wound me deeply; but , as the object of your love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> look into the world; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain , are there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> confide some other passion to me , if you will; i will be the truest , warmest , and most faithful friend you have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> harry still retained the other . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you can say nothing to alter my resolution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a duty that i must perform . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i owe it , alike to others , and to myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i owe it to myself , that i , a friendless , portionless , girl , with a blight upon my name , should not give your friends reason to suspect that i had sordidly yielded to your first passion , and fastened myself , a clog , on all your hopes and projects . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if your inclinations chime with your sense of duty harry began . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they do not , replied rose , colouring deeply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you return my love? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - say but that , dear rose; say but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i could have done so , without doing heavy wrong to him i loved , rejoined rose ,  - i could have<s> <s>  - have received this declaration very differently? </s> </s>

<s> <s> all the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life , are in store for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but those connections are proud; and i will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother s place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a word , said the young lady , turning away , as her temporary firmness forsook her ,  - there is a stain upon my name , which the world visits on innocent heads . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - one word more , rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dearest rose! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one more! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried harry , throwing himself before her . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - do not press me to reply , answered rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the question does not arise , and never will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if your answer be what i almost dare to hope it is , retorted harry ,  - it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way , and light the path before me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all i have suffered for you , and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this one question! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> busy recollections of old hopes , cherished as a girl , long ago , crowded into the mind of rose , while making this avowal; but they brought tears with them , as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they relieved her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i cannot help this weakness , and it makes my purpose stronger , said rose , extending her hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ask one promise , said harry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not to press me to alter my right determination , replied rose , with a melancholy smile;  - it will be useless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said harry;  - to hear you repeat it , if you willfinally repeat it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will lay at your feet , whatever of station of fortune i may possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution , will not seek , by word or act , to change it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the young man caught her to his bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead , hurried from the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning; eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the doctor , as harry maylie joined him and oliver at the breakfast - table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hope i may have good cause to do so , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but yesterday morning you had made up your mind , in a great hurry , to stay here , and to accompany your mother , like a dutiful son , to the sea - side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before noon , you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as i go , on your road to london . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and at night , you urge me , with great mystery , to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is , that young oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> too bad , isn t it , oliver? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie went away , sir , rejoined oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s a fine fellow , said the doctor;  - you shall come and see me when you return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , to speak seriously , harry; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the great nobs , replied harry ,  - under which designation , i presume , you include my most stately uncle , have not communicated with me at all , since i have been here; nor , at this time of the year , is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but of course they will get you into parliament at the election before christmas , and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there s something in that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good training is always desirable , whether the race be for place , cup , or sweepstakes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> harry maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but he contented himself with saying ,  - we shall see , and pursued the subject no farther . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the post - chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards; and giles coming in for the luggage , the good doctor bustled out , to see it packed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oliver , said harry maylie , in a low voice ,  - let me speak a word with you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver walked into the window - recess to which mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> will you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should like to know howhow my mother and miss maylie are , said the young man;  - and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take , and what you talk about , and whether shethey , i meanseem happy and quite well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> quite , sir , quite , replied oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would rather you did not mention it to them , said harry , hurrying over his words;  - because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener , and it is a trouble and worry to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i depend upon you . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie took leave of him , with many assurances of his regard and protection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window , and jumped into the carriage . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - halloa! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you hear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jingling and clattering , till distance rendered its noise inaudible , and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye , the vehicle wound its way along the road , almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing , and now becoming visible again , as intervening objects , or the intricacies of the way , permitted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen , that the gazers dispersed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and there was one looker - on , who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared , long after it was many miles away; for , behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when harry raised his eyes towards the window , sat rose herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he seems in high spirits and happy , she said , at length . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i feared for a time he might be otherwise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was mistaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down rose s face , as she sat pensively at the window , still gazing in the same direction , seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a paper fly - cage dangled from the ceiling , to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and , as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net - work , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble would heave a deep sigh , while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor was mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were not wanting other appearances , and those closely connected with his own person , which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the laced coat , and the cocked hat; where were they? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he still wore knee - breeches , and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs; but they were not the breeches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the coat was wide - skirted; and in that respect like the coat , but , oh how different! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble was no longer a beadle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are some promotions in life , which , independent of the more substantial rewards they offer , require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i sold myself , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , pursuing the same train of reflection ,  - for six teaspoons , a pair of sugar - tongs , and a milk - pot; with a small quantity of second - hand furniture , and twenty pound in money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i went very reasonable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cheap , dirt cheap! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - cheap! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried a shrill voice in mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble s ear:  - you would have been dear at any price; and dear enough i paid for you , lord above knows that! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble turned , and encountered the face of his interesting consort , who , imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint , had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , ma am! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , fixing his eyes upon her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a eye i never knew to fail with paupers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if it fails with her , my power is gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers , who , being lightly fed , are in no very high condition; or whether the late mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> corney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are matters of opinion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the matter of fact , is , that the matron was in no way overpowered by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble s scowl , but , on the contrary , treated it with great disdain , and even raised a laugh thereat , which sounded as though it were genuine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on hearing this most unexpected sound , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble looked , first incredulous , and afterwards amazed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then relapsed into his former state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am going to sit here , as long as i think proper , ma am , rejoined mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your prerogative! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sneered mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , with ineffable contempt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i said the word , ma am , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the prerogative of a man is to command . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what s the prerogative of a woman , in the name of goodness? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the relict of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> corney deceased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to obey , ma am , thundered mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you; and then , perhaps , he might have been alive now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble was a hard - hearted brute , fell into a paroxysm of tears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble s soul; his heart was waterproof . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like washable beaver hats that improve with rain , his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous , by showers of tears , which , being tokens of weakness , and so far tacit admissions of his own power , pleased and exalted him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction , and begged , in an encouraging manner , that she should cry her hardest: the exercise being looked upon , by the faculty , as strongly conducive to health . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it opens the lungs , washes the countenance , exercises the eyes , and softens down the temper , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this preliminary proceeding laying bare his head , the expert lady , clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand , inflicted a shower of blows ( dealt with singular vigour and dexterity ) upon it with the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - get up! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , in a voice of command . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and take yourself away from here , unless you want me to do something desperate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble rose with a very rueful countenance: wondering much what something desperate might be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> picking up his hat , he looked towards the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you going? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - hem! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , summoning up all his native dignity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - these women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hallo there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble opened the door , and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner: which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air , as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> repeated mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you do here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble: glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash - tub , who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse - master s humility . </s> </s>

<s> <s> demanded mrs . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he looked dejectedly round , and slunk away; and , as he reached the door , the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it wanted but this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship , to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen - peckery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all in two months! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no more than two months ago , i was not only my own master , but everybody else s , so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned , and now! <s> <s> it was too much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him ( for he had reached the portal in his reverie ); and walked , distractedly , into the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it began to rain , heavily , at the moment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this determined him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man who was seated there , was tall and dark , and wore a large cloak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he eyed bumble askance , as he entered , but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar: so he drank his gin - and - water in silence , and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they had encountered each other s glance several times in this way , the stranger , in a harsh , deep voice , broke silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - were you looking for me , he said ,  - when you peered in at the window? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble stopped short; for he was curious to know the stranger s name , and thought in his impatience , he might supply the blank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see you were not , said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth;  - or you have known my name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you don t know it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would recommend you not to ask for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i meant no harm , young man , observed mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , majestically . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and have done none , said the stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken by the stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have seen you before , i think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you were beadle here , once; were you not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i was , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just so , rejoined the other , nodding his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was in that character i saw you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are you now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - master of the workhouse , rejoined mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , slowly and impressively , to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have the same eye to your own interest , that you always had , i doubt not? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i suppose , a married man , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , shading his eyes with his hand , and surveying the stranger , from head to foot , in evident perplexity ,  - is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can , than a single one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee , when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger smiled , and nodded his head again: as much to say , he had not mistaken his man; then rang the bell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fill this glass again , he said , handing mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> hastily calling this circumstance to mind , he informed the stranger , with an air of mystery , that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died; and that she could , as he had reason to believe , throw some light on the subject of his inquiry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how can i find her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - only through me , rejoined mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - tomorrow , rejoined bumble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i needn t tell you to be secret . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it s your interest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shortly remarking that their roads were different , he departed , without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on glancing at the address , the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you want? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the man , turning quickly round , as bumble touched him on the arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - following me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - only to ask a question , said the other , pointing to the scrap of paper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what name am i to ask for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - monks! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rejoined the man; and strode hastily away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a dull , close , overcast summer evening . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the clouds , which had been threatening all day , spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour , already yielded large drops of rain , and seemed to presage a violent thunder - storm , when mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the husband carried a lantern , from which , however , no light yet shone; and trudged on , a few paces in front , as thoughthe way being dirtyto give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a collection of mere hovels: some , hastily built with loose bricks: others , of old worm - eaten ship - timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement , and planted , for the most part , within a few feet of the river s bank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river , which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building , formerly used as a manufactory of some kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it had , in its day , probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it had long since gone to ruin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rat , the worm , and the action of the damp , had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder , tottering and bending over the dark stream , seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion , and involving itself in the same fate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door , breast - high , on the second story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is that the man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble s good lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble nodded in the affirmative . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , mind what i told you , said the matron:  - and be careful to say as little as you can , or you ll betray us at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , who had eyed the building with very rueful looks , was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then , when he was prevented by the appearance of monks: who opened a small door , near which they stood , and beckoned them inwards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come in! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t keep me here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woman , who had hesitated at first , walked boldly in , without any other invitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what the devil made you stand lingering there , in the wet? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monks , turning round , and addressing bumble , after he had bolted the door behind them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> retorted monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you won t cool yourself so easily; don t think it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this agreeable speech , monks turned short upon the matron , and bent his gaze upon her , till even she , who was not easily cowed , was fain to withdraw her eyes , and turn them towards the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is the woman , is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hem! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is the woman , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , mindful of his wife s caution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you think women never can keep secrets , i suppose? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the matron , interposing , and returning , as she spoke , the searching look of monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what may that be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the matron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , by the same rule , if a woman s a party to a secret that might hang or transport her , i m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not i! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you understand , mistress? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , rejoined the matron , slightly colouring as she spoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of course you don t! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how should you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bestowing something half - way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions , and again beckoning them to follow him , the man hastened across the apartment , which was of considerable extent , but low in the roof . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hear it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hear it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i hate the sound! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained silent for a few moments; and then , removing his hands suddenly from his face , showed , to the unspeakable discomposure of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - these fits come over me , now and then , said monks , observing his alarm;  - and thunder sometimes brings them on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t mind me now; it s all over for this once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus speaking , he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the window - shutter of the room into which it led , lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said monks , when they had all three seated themselves ,  - the sooner we come to our business , the better for all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woman know what it is , does she? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died; and that she told you something<s> <s>  - about the mother of the boy you named , replied the matron interrupting him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s the second , observed the woman with much deliberation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the first is , what may the communication be worth? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who the devil can tell that , without knowing of what kind it is? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nobody better than you , i am persuaded , answered mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble: who did not want for spirit , as her yoke - fellow could abundantly testify . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - something that was taken from her , said monks . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed , listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he directed towards his wife and monks , by turns , in undisguised astonishment; increased , if possible , when the latter sternly demanded , what sum was required for the disclosure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s it worth to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the woman , as collectedly as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - speak out , and let me know which . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five - and - twenty pounds in gold , said the woman;  - and i ll tell you all i know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - five - and - twenty pounds! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed monks , drawing back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i spoke as plainly as i could , replied mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s not a large sum , either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - such matters keep well , and , like good wine , often double their value in course of time , answered the matron , still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as to lying dead , there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come , or twelve million , for anything you or i know , who will tell strange tales at last! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you can easily take it away again , replied the matron . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not alone , my dear , nor unprotected , neither , submitted mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are a fool , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , in reply;  - and had better hold your tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he had better have cut it out , before he came , if he can t speak in a lower tone , said monks , grimly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he my husband! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tittered the matron , parrying the question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so much the better; i have less hesitation in dealing with two people , when i find that there s only one will between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i m in earnest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he thrust his hand into a side - pocket; and producing a canvas bag , told out twenty - five sovereigns on the table , and pushed them over to the woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , he said ,  - gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder , which i feel is coming up to break over the house - top , is gone , let s hear your story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monks , in the same hollow whisper;  - no sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no one who could hear , and might , by possibility , understand? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not a soul , replied the woman;  - we were alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good , said monks , regarding her attentively . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she spoke of a young creature , resumed the matron ,  - who had brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room , but in the same bed , in which she then lay dying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ay? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monks , with quivering lip , and glancing over his shoulder ,  - blood! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how things come about! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the child was the one you named to him last night , said the matron , nodding carelessly towards her husband;  - the mother this nurse had robbed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in life? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in death , replied the woman , with something like a shudder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she stole from the corpse , when it had hardly turned to one , that which the dead mother had prayed her , with her last breath , to keep for the infant s sake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she sold it , cried monks , with desperate eagerness;  - did she sell it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to whom? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how long before? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried monks , in a voice which , from its very suppression , seemed only the more furious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s a lie! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ll not be played with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she said more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ll tear the life out of you both , but i ll know what it was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing , replied the woman;  - it was a pawnbroker s duplicate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in good time i ll tell you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i judge that she had kept the trinket , for some time , in the hope of turning it to better account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker s interest year by year , and prevent its running out; so that if anything came of it , it could still be redeemed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , replied the woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair , and a plain gold wedding - ring . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and this is all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monks , after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble drew a long breath , as if he were glad to find that the story was over , and no mention made of taking the five - and - twenty pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose , unchecked , during the whole of the previous dialogue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know nothing of the story , beyond what i can guess at , said his wife addressing monks , after a short silence;  - and i want to know nothing; for it s safer not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i may ask you two questions , may i? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may ask , said monks , with some show of surprise;  - but whether i answer or not is another question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - which makes three , observed mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , essaying a stroke of facetiousness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is that what you expected to get from me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is , replied monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the other question? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you propose to do with it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never , rejoined monks;  - nor against me either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these words , he suddenly wheeled the table aside , and pulling an iron ring in the boarding , threw back a large trap - door which opened close at mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble s feet , and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward , with great precipitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look down , said monks , lowering the lantern into the gulf . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t fear me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could have let you down , quietly enough , when you were seated over it , if that had been my game . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus encouraged , the matron drew near to the brink; and even mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there had once been a water - mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes , and fragments of machinery that yet remained , seemed to dart onward , with a new impulse , when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you flung a man s body down there , where would it be tomorrow morning? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monks drew the little packet from his breast , where he had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight , which had formed a part of some pulley , and was lying on the floor , dropped it into the stream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it fell straight , and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the three looking into each other s faces , seemed to breathe more freely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we have nothing more to say , and may break up our pleasant party . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by all means , observed mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , with great alacrity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you ll keep a quiet tongue in your head , will you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said monks , with a threatening look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not afraid of your wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on everybody s account , young man; on my own , you know , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am glad , for your sake , to hear it , remarked monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - light your lantern! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and get away from here as fast as you can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bumble , holding his lantern a foot above the ground , walked not only with remarkable care , but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure: looking nervously about him for hidden trap - doors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were no sooner gone , than monks , who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone , called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter , disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> william sikes , awakening from a nap , drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes propounded this question , was not one of those he had tenanted , previous to the chertsey expedition , although it was in the same quarter of the town , and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not , in appearance , so desirable a habitation as his old quarters: being a mean and badly - furnished apartment , of very limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof , and abutting on a close and dirty lane . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman s having gone down in the world of late: for a great scarcity of furniture , and total absence of comfort , together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen , bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms , if they had stood in any need of corroboration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the housebreaker was lying on the bed , wrapped in his white great - coat , by way of dressing - gown , and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness , and the addition of a soiled nightcap , and a stiff , black beard of a week s growth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dog sat at the bedside: now eyeing his master with a wistful look , and now pricking his ears , and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street , or in the lower part of the house , attracted his attention . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - not long gone seven , said the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how do you feel tonight , bill? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as weak as water , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here; lend us a hand , and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> illness had not improved mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes s temper; for , as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair , he muttered various curses on her awkwardness , and struck her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whining are you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - why not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - such a number of nights , said the girl , with a touch of woman s tenderness , which communicated something like sweetness of tone , even to her voice:  - such a number of nights as i ve been patient with you , nursing and caring for you , as if you had been a child: and this the first that i ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn t have served me as you did just now , if you d thought of that , would you? </s> </s>

<s> <s> get up and bustle about , and don t come over me with your woman s nonsense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at any other time , this remonstrance , and the tone in which it was delivered , would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really weak and exhausted , dropped her head over the back of the chair , and fainted , before mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> john dawkins ( otherwise the artful dodger ) , who had followed his venerable friend into the room , hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of master charles bates who came close at his heels , uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth , and poured a portion of its contents down the patient s throat: previously taking a taste , himself , to prevent mistakes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows , charley , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dawkins;  - and you slap her hands , fagin , while bill undoes the petticuts . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - no evil wind at all , my dear , for evil winds blow nobody any good; and i ve brought something good with me , that you ll be glad to see . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - not that infernal hole we were in before , she could hear the man say as they went upstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and , immediately afterwards , the two men were heard descending . </s> </s>

<s> <s> when he returned , the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet , as if preparing to be gone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , nance! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed the jew , starting back as he put down the candle ,  - how pale you are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pale! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> echoed the girl , shading her eyes with her hands , as if to look steadily at him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - quite horrible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what have you been doing to yourself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing that i know of , except sitting in this close place for i don t know how long and all , replied the girl carelessly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me get back; that s a dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they parted without more conversation , merely interchanging a  - good - night . </s> </s>

<s> <s> after completely exhausting herself , she stopped to take breath: and , as if suddenly recollecting herself , and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon , wrung her hands , and burst into tears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it might be that her tears relieved her , or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost time , and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts: soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if she betrayed any agitation , when she presented herself to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money , and receiving a reply in the affirmative , he uttered a growl of satisfaction , and replacing his head upon the pillow , resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step , which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon , would have been obvious to the lynx - eyed fagin , who would most probably have taken the alarm at once; but mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination , and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and being , furthermore , in an unusually amiable condition , as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor , and indeed , troubled himself so little about her , that , had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was , it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as that day closed in , the girl s excitement increased; and , when night came on , and she sat by , watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep , there was an unusual paleness in her cheek , and a fire in her eye , that even sikes observed with astonishment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes being weak from the fever , was lying in bed , taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass towards nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time , when these symptoms first struck him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , burn my body! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - matter! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do you look at me so hard for? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - what is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of many things , bill , replied the girl , shivering , and as she did so , pressing her hands upon her eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , lord! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what odds in that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i tell you wot it is , said sikes;  - if you haven t caught the fever , and got it comin  on , now , there s something more than usual in the wind , and something dangerous too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you re not a - going to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , damme! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you wouldn t do that! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she s got the fever coming on; that s it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fortifying himself with this assurance , sikes drained the glass to the bottom , and then , with many grumbling oaths , called for his physic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , said the robber ,  - come and sit aside of me , and put on your own face; or i ll alter it so , that you won t know it agin when you do want it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl obeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes , locking her hand in his , fell back upon the pillow: turning his eyes upon her face . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he shifted his position restlessly; and , after dozing again , and again , for two or three minutes , and as often springing up with a look of terror , and gazing vacantly about him , was suddenly stricken , as it were , while in the very attitude of rising , into a deep and heavy sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the laudanum has taken effect at last , murmured the girl , as she rose from the bedside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i may be too late , even now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully round , from time to time , as if , despite the sleeping draught , she expected every moment to feel the pressure of sikes s heavy hand upon her shoulder; then , stooping softly over the bed , she kissed the robber s lips; and then opening and closing the room - door with noiseless touch , hurried from the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - has it long gone the half - hour? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it ll strike the hour in another quarter , said the man: raising his lantern to her face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and i cannot get there in less than an hour or more , muttered nancy: brushing swiftly past him , and gliding rapidly down the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the clock struck ten , increasing her impatience . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the woman is mad! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town , the streets were comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some quickened their pace behind , as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her , and looked back , surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she neared her place of destination , she was alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute , and making up her mind to advance; but the sound determined her , and she stepped into the hall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the porter s seat was vacant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she looked round with an air of incertitude , and advanced towards the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , young woman! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - a lady! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what lady? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - miss maylie , said nancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young woman , who had by this time , noted her appearance , replied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to him , nancy repeated her request . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what name am i to say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the waiter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nor business? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , nor that neither , rejoined the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must see the lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the man , pushing her towards the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall be carried out if i go! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the girl violently;  - and i can make that a job that two of you won t like to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> isn t there anybody here , she said , looking round ,  - that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - take it up for her , joe; can t you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said this person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s the good? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied the man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you don t suppose the young lady will see such as her; do you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this allusion to nancy s doubtful character , raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids , who remarked , with great fervour , that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly advocated her being thrown , ruthlessly , into the kennel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the soft - hearted cook added his intercession , and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the man , with one foot on the stairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that a young woman earnestly asks to speak to miss maylie alone , said nancy;  - and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say , she will know whether to hear her business , or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man ran upstairs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the third contented herself with wondering  - what ladies was made of; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of  - shameful! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: nancy followed the man , with trembling limbs , to a small ante - chamber , lighted by a lamp from the ceiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl s life had been squandered in the streets , and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of london , but there was something of the woman s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered , and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain , she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame , and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if i had taken offence , and gone away , as many would have done , you d have been sorry for it one day , and not without reason either . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not think of that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tell me why you wished to see me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the kind tone of this answer , the sweet voice , the gentle manner , the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure , took the girl completely by surprise , and she burst into tears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , lady , lady! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she said , clasping her hands passionately before her face ,  - if there was more like you , there would be fewer like me ,there wouldthere would! </s> </s>

<s> <s> do not mind shrinking openly from me , lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the poorest women fall back , as i make my way along the crowded pavement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what dreadful things are these! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank heaven upon your knees , dear lady , cried the girl ,  - that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood , and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger , and riot and drunkenness , andandsomething worse than allas i have been from my cradle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i may use the word , for the alley and the gutter were mine , as they will be my deathbed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i pity you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said rose , in a broken voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you knew what i am sometimes , you would pity me , indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i have stolen away from those who would surely murder me , if they knew i had been here , to tell you what i have overheard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do you know a man named monks? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he knows you , replied the girl;  - and knew you were here , for it was by hearing him tell the place that i found you out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never heard the name , said rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then he goes by some other amongst us , rejoined the girl ,  - which i more than thought before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some time ago , and soon after oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery , isuspecting this manlistened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that monks , pursued the girl ,  - had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him , and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for , though i couldn t make out why . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a bargain was struck with fagin , that if oliver was got back he should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a thief , which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened , in the hope of finding out , said the girl;  - and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i did; and i saw him no more till last night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what occurred then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll tell you , lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> last night he came again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first words i heard monks say were these: so the only proofs of the boy s identity lie at the bottom of the river , and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  they laughed , and talked of his success in doing this; and monks , talking on about the boy , and getting very wild , said that though he had got the young devil s money safely now , he d rather have had it the other way; for , what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father s will , by driving him through every jail in town , and then hauling him up for some capital felony which fagin could easily manage , after having made a good profit of him besides . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is all this! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the truth , lady , though it comes from my lips , replied the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , he said , with oaths common enough in my ears , but strange to yours , that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy s life without bringing his own neck in danger , he would; but , as he couldn t , he d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he took advantage of his birth and history , he might harm him yet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - those were his words , said nancy , glancing uneasily round , as she had scarcely ceased to do , since she began to speak , for a vision of sikes haunted her perpetually . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he spoke of you and the other lady , and said it seemed contrived by heaven , or the devil , against him , that oliver should come into your hands , he laughed , and said there was some comfort in that too , for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give , if you had them , to know who your two - legged spaniel was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he spoke in hard and angry earnest , if a man ever did , replied the girl , shaking her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is an earnest man when his hatred is up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know many who do worse things; but i d rather listen to them all a dozen times , than to that monks once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must get back quickly . </s> </s>

<s> <s> back! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you repeat this information to a gentleman whom i can summon in an instant from the next room , you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour s delay . </s> </s>

<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lady , cried the girl , sinking on her knees ,  - dear , sweet , angel lady , you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these , and if i had heard them years ago , they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow; but it is too late , it is too late! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is never too late , said rose ,  - for penitence and atonement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing could save him , cried the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i told others what i have told you , and led to their being taken , he would be sure to die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is the boldest , and has been so cruel! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it possible , cried rose ,  - that for such a man as this , you can resign every future hope , and the certainty of immediate rescue? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i must go back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whether it is god s wrath for the wrong i have done , i do not know; but i am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage; and i should be , i believe , if i knew that i was to die by his hand at last . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should not let you depart from me thus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you should , lady , and i know you will , rejoined the girl , rising . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - of what use , then , is the communication you have made? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but where can i find you again when it is necessary? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not seek to know where these dreadful people live , but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i promise you solemnly , answered rose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - every sunday night , from eleven until the clock strikes twelve , said the girl without hesitation ,  - i will walk on london bridge if i am alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stay another moment , interposed rose , as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have a claim on me: not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence , but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you return to this gang of robbers , and to this man , when a word can save you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is there nothing left , to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when such as i , who have no certain roof but the coffinlid , and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse , set our rotten hearts on any man , and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives , who can hope to cure us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will , said rose , after a pause ,  - take some money from me , which may enable you to live without dishonestyat all events until we meet again? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not a penny , replied the girl , waving her hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you , said rose , stepping gently forward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wish to serve you indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god bless you , sweet lady , and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought shame on mine! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her situation was , indeed , one of no common trial and difficulty . </s> </s>

<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne was with them , and would be for the next two days; but rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman s impetuosity , and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which , in the first explosion of his indignation , he would regard the instrument of oliver s recapture , to trust him with the secret , when her representations in the girl s behalf could be seconded by no experienced person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to resorting to any legal adviser , even if she had known how to do so , it was scarcely to be thought of , for the same reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after more communing with herself next day , she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting harry . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but perhaps he will not come; he may write , or he may come himself , and studiously abstain from meeting mehe did when he went away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and here rose dropped the pen , and turned away , as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she had taken up the same pen , and laid it down again fifty times , and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word , when oliver , who had been walking in the streets , with mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - what makes you look so flurried? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i hardly know how; i feel as if i should be choked , replied the boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never thought you had told us anything but the truth , said rose , soothing him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what is this? of whom do you speak? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have seen the gentleman , replied oliver , scarcely able to articulate ,  - the gentleman who was so good to memr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , that we have so often talked about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where? </s> </s>

<s> <s> she very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account . </s> </s>

<s> <s> brownlow , i believe , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said rose , glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he drew his chair nearer to miss maylie s , and said ,<s> <s>  - do me the favour , my dear young lady , to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak , and of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once induced to entertain of that poor child , in heaven s name put me in possession of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a bad one! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig , speaking by some ventriloquial power , without moving a muscle of his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart , said rose , colouring;  - and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years , has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i m only sixty - one , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig , with the same rigid face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and , as the devil s in it if this oliver is not twelve years old at least , i don t see the application of that remark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do not heed my friend , miss maylie , said mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yes , he does , growled mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - he would deserve to have it knocked off , if he does , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and he d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it , responded mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having gone thus far , the two old gentlemen severally took snuff , and afterwards shook hands , according to their invariable custom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now , miss maylie , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow ,  - to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that i exhausted every means in my power of discovering him , and that since i have been absent from this country , my first impression that he had imposed upon me , and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me , has been considerably shaken . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose , who had had time to collect her thoughts , at once related , in a few natural words , all that had befallen oliver since he left mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow s house; reserving nancy s information for that gentleman s private ear , and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow , for some months past , had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thank god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the old gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but you have not told me where he is now , miss maylie . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you must pardon my finding fault with you ,but why not have brought him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with which he hurried out of the room , down the stairs , up the coachsteps , and into the coach , without another word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the room - door closed behind him , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig lifted up his head , and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot , described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table; sitting in it all the time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t be afraid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i m old enough to be your grandfather . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you re a sweet girl . </s> </s>

<s> <s> here they are! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact , as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in oliver s behalf , rose maylie would have been well repaid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a curtsey at the door , waited for orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , you get blinder every day , bedwin , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , rather testily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , that i do , sir , replied the old lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - people s eyes , at my time of life , don t improve with age , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i could have told you that , rejoined mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow;  - but put on your glasses , and see if you can t find out what you were wanted for , will you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but oliver s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to his first impulse , he sprang into her arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the old lady , embracing him;  - it is my innocent boy! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my dear old nurse! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he would come backi knew he would , said the old lady , holding him in her arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how well he looks , and how like a gentleman s son he is dressed again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where have you been , this long , long while? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same sweet face , but not so pale; the same soft eye , but not so sad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have never forgotten them or his quiet smile , but have seen them every day , side by side with those of my own dear children , dead and gone since i was a lightsome young creature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> running on thus , and now holding oliver from her to mark how he had grown , now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair , the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leaving her and oliver to compare notes at leisure , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne in the first instance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design , it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o clock that evening , and that in the meantime mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor s wrath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> blathers and duff; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , doubtless , he would , in this first outbreak , have carried the intention into effect without a moment s consideration of the consequences , if he had not been restrained , in part , by corresponding violence on the side of mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , who was himself of an irascible temperament , and partly by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the impetuous doctor , when they had rejoined the two ladies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds , male and female , and beg them to accept a hundred pounds , or so , apiece , as a trifling mark of our esteem , and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to oliver? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gentleness and care , exclaimed the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i d send them one and all to<s> <s>  - never mind where , interposed mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what object? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne , cooling himself with his pocket - handkerchief;  - i almost forgot that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hanging a few of them at least , in all probability , suggested the doctor ,  - and transporting the rest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very good , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , smiling;  - but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time , and if we step in to forestall them , it seems to me that we shall be performing a very quixotic act , in direct opposition to our own interestor at least to oliver s , which is the same thing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery , unless we can bring this man , monks , upon his knees . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that can only be done by stratagem , and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for , suppose he were apprehended , we have no proof against him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said the doctor impetuously ,  - i put it to you again , whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions , but really<s> <s>  - do not discuss the point , my dear young lady , pray , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , interrupting rose as she was about to speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the promise shall be kept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i don t think it will , in the slightest degree , interfere with our proceedings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , before we can resolve upon any precise course of action , it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks , on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us , and not by the law; or , if she will not , or cannot do that , to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person , as will enable us to identify him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would suggest that in the meantime , we remain perfectly quiet , and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> although mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days , he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then; and as both rose and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is a strange creature , but a shrewd one , and might prove of material assistance to us; i should say that he was bred a lawyer , and quitted the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course , in twenty years , though whether that is recommendation or not , you must determine for yourselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in mine , said the doctor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow ,  - who may he be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie , and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose blushed deeply , but she did not make any audible objection to this motion ( possibly she felt in a hopeless minority ); and harry maylie and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we stay in town , of course , said mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie ,  - while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested , and i am content to remain here , if it be for twelve months , so long as you assure me that any hope remains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rejoined mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and as i see on the faces about me , a disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the way to corroborate oliver s tale , and had so suddenly left the kingdom , let me stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such time as i may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> supper has been announced , and young oliver , who is all alone in the next room , will have begun to think , by this time , that we have wearied of his company , and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these words , the old gentleman gave his hand to mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female: for the former was one of those long - limbed , knock - kneed , shambling , bony people , to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age ,looking as they do , when they are yet boys , like undergrown men , and when they are almost men , like overgrown boys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the woman was young , but of a robust and hardy make , as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her companion was not encumbered with much luggage , as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder , a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief , and apparently light enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this circumstance , added to the length of his legs , which were of unusual extent , enabled him with much ease to keep some half - dozen paces in advance of his companion , to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head: as if reproaching her tardiness , and urging her to greater exertion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , they had toiled along the dusty road , taking little heed of any object within sight , save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail - coaches which were whirling out of town , until they passed through highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion ,<s> <s>  - come on , can t yer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a lazybones yer are , charlotte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s a heavy load , i can tell you , said the female , coming up , almost breathless with fatigue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what are yer talking about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is it much farther? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the woman , resting herself against a bank , and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - much farther! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yer as good as there , said the long - legged tramper , pointing out before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those are the lights of london . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they re a good two mile off , at least , said the woman despondingly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as noah s red nose grew redder with anger , and as he crossed the road while speaking , as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution , the woman rose without any further remark , and trudged onward by his side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how should i know? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - near , i hope , said charlotte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , not near , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when i tell yer that i don t mean to do a thing , that s enough , without any why or because either , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole with dignity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a pretty thing it would be , wouldn t it to go and stop at the very first public - house outside the town , so that sowerberry , if he come up after us , might poke in his old nose , and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole in a jeering tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets i can find , and not stop till we come to the very out - of - the - wayest house i can set eyes on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cod , yer may thanks yer stars i ve got a head; for if we hadn t gone , at first , the wrong road a purpose , and come back across country , yer d have been locked up hard and fast a week ago , my lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and serve yer right for being a fool . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know i ain t as cunning as you are , replied charlotte;  - but don t put all the blame on me , and say i should have been locked up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yer took the money from the till , yer know yer did , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i took it for you , noah , dear , rejoined charlotte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no; you trusted in me , and let me carry it like a dear , and so you are , said the lady , chucking him under the chin , and drawing her arm through his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was indeed the case; but as it was not mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole s habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody , it should be observed , in justice to that gentleman , that he had trusted charlotte to this extent , in order that , if they were pursued , the money might be found on her: which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft , and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in pursuance of this cautious plan , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole went on , without halting , until he arrived at the angel at islington , where he wisely judged , from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles , that london began in earnest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> through these streets , noah claypole walked , dragging charlotte after him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public - house; now jogging on again , as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length , he stopped in front of one , more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and , having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement , graciously announced his intention of putting up there , for the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so give us the bundle , said noah , unstrapping it from the woman s shoulders , and slinging it over his own;  - and don t yer speak , except when yer spoke to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what s the name of the houset - h - rthree what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - cripples , said charlotte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - three cripples , repeated noah ,  - and a very good sign too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> keep close at my heels , and come along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these injunctions , he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder , and entered the house , followed by his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was nobody in the bar but a young jew , who , with his two elbows on the counter , was reading a dirty newspaper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he stared very hard at noah , and noah stared very hard at him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if noah had been attired in his charity - boy s dress , there might have been some reason for the jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had discarded the coat and badge , and wore a short smock - frock over his leathers , there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public - house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked noah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is the dabe of this  ouse , replied the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we want to sleep here tonight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i b dot certaid you cad , said barney , who was the attendant sprite;  - but i ll idquire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - show us the tap , and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring , will yer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said noah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> barney complied by ushering them into a small back - room , and setting the required viands before them; having done which , he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night , and left the amiable couple to their refreshment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now , this back - room was immediately behind the bar , and some steps lower , so that any person connected with the house , undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last - named apartment , about five feet from its flooring , could not only look down upon any guests in the back - room without any great hazard of being observed ( the glass being in a dark angle of the wall , between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself ) , but could , by applying his ear to the partition , ascertain with tolerable distinctness , their subject of conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes , and barney had only just returned from making the communication above related , when fagin , in the course of his evening s business , came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said barney:  - stradegers id the next roob . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - strangers! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole taking cold beef from the dish , and porter from the pot , and administering homeopathic doses of both to charlotte , who sat patiently by , eating and drinking at his pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he whispered , looking round to barney ,  - i like that fellow s looks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he d be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t make as much noise as a mouse , my dear , and let me hear  em talklet me hear  em . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he again applied his eye to the glass , and turning his ear to the partition , listened attentively: with a subtle and eager look upon his face , that might have appertained to some old goblin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so i mean to be a gentleman , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole , kicking out his legs , and continuing a conversation , the commencement of which fagin had arrived too late to hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should like that well enough , dear , replied charlotte;  - but tills ain t to be emptied every day , and people to get clear off after it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tills be blowed! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pockets , women s ridicules , houses , mail - coaches , banks! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but you can t do all that , dear , said charlotte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall look out to get into company with them as can , replied noah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they ll be able to make us useful some way or another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , you yourself are worth fifty women; i never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when i let yer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed charlotte , imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , that ll do: don t yer be too affectionate , in case i m cross with yer , said noah , disengaging himself with great gravity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should like to be the captain of some band , and have the whopping of  em , and follering  em about , unbeknown to themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that would suit me , if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort , i say it would be cheap at that twenty - pound note you ve got ,especially as we don t very well know how to get rid of it ourselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was meditating another , when the sudden opening of the door , and the appearance of a stranger , interrupted him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stranger was mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a pleasant night , sir , but cool for the time of year , said fagin , rubbing his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from the country , i see , sir? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked noah claypole . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we have not so much dust as that in london , replied fagin , pointing from noah s shoes to those of his companion , and from them to the two bundles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , one need be sharp in this town , my dear , replied the jew , sinking his voice to a confidential whisper;  - and that s the truth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger ,a gesture which noah attempted to imitate , though not with complete success , in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion , and put about the liquor which barney reappeared with , in a very friendly manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good stuff that , observed mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole , smacking his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dear! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair , and looked from the jew to charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was very lucky it was only me . </s> </s>

<s> <s> there is not a safer place in all this town than is the cripples; that is , when i like to make it so . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - yer speak as if yer were in earnest , replied noah . </s> </s>

<s> <s> inquired fagin , shrugging his shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me have a word with you outside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move , said noah , getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she ll take the luggage upstairs the while . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charlotte , see to them bundles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this mandate , which had been delivered with great majesty , was obeyed without the slightest demur; and charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while noah held the door open and watched her out . </s> </s>

<s> <s> whether noah claypole , whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive , would have acceded even to these glowing terms , had he been a perfectly free agent , is very doubtful; but as he recollected that , in the event of his refusal , it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately ( and more unlikely things had come to pass ) , he gradually relented , and said he thought that would suit him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but , yer see , observed noah ,  - as she will be able to do a good deal , i should like to take something very light . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - the gallows , continued fagin ,  - the gallows , my dear , is an ugly finger - post , which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow s career on the broad highway . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i m doubtful about it , replied fagin , with a sigh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if they don t get any fresh evidence , it ll only be a summary conviction , and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but , if they do , it s a case of lagging . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  -  cause it isn t on the rec - ord , is it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said charley , chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets;  -  cause it can t come out in the  dictment;  cause nobody will never know half of what he was . </s> </s>

<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin had so well humoured his young friend s eccentric disposition , that master bates , who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned dodger rather in the light of a victim , now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour , and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let me think . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you don t mean to go yourself , i suppose? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that wouldn t quite fit , replied fagin shaking his head . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - nobody knows him . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - what should he have to mind? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - really nothing , my dear , said fagin , turning to mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - no , nonone of that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it s not in my department , that ain t . </s> </s>

<s> <s> inquired master bates , surveying noah s lank form with much disgust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the cutting away when there s anything wrong , and the eating all the wittles when there s everything right; is that his branch? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> master bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat , that it was some time before fagin could interpose , and represent to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police - office; that , inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged , nor any description of his person , had yet been forwarded to the metropolis , it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter; and that , if he were properly disguised , it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in london , inasmuch as it would be , of all places , the very last , to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bolter at length consented , with a very bad grace , to undertake the expedition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by fagin s directions , he immediately substituted for his own attire , a waggoner s frock , velveteen breeches , and leather leggings: all of which articles the jew had at hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter s whip . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus equipped , he was to saunter into the office , as some country fellow from covent garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward , ungainly , and raw - boned a fellow as need be , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these arrangements completed , he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the artful dodger , and was conveyed by master bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of bow street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noah claypole , or morris bolter as the reader pleases , punctually followed the directions he had received , whichmaster bates being pretty well acquainted with the localitywere so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question , or meeting with any interruption by the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he found himself jostled among a crowd of people , chiefly women , who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room , at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest , with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall , a box for the witnesses in the middle , and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful locality last named , being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze , and left the vulgar to imagine ( if they could ) the full majesty of justice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there were only a couple of women in the dock , who were nodding to their admiring friends , while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a jailer stood reclining against the dock - rail , tapping his nose listlessly with a large key , except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers , by proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman  - take that baby out , when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries , half - smothered in the mother s shawl , from some meagre infant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was an old smoky bust over the mantel - shelf , and a dusty clock above the dockthe only thing present , that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity , or poverty , or an habitual acquaintance with both , had left a taint on all the animate matter , hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noah looked eagerly about him for the dodger; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character s mother or sister , and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father , nobody at all answering the description given him of mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> dawkins , who , shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual , his left hand in his pocket , and his hat in his right hand , preceded the jailer , with a rolling gait altogether indescribable , and , taking his place in the dock , requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that  ere disgraceful sitivation for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hold your tongue , will you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i m an englishman , ain t i? </s> </s>

<s> <s> which so tickled the spectators , that they laughed almost as heartily as master bates could have done if he had heard the request . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - silence there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired one of the magistrates . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - has the boy ever been here before? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - wery good . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here there was another laugh , and another cry of silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now then , where are the witnesses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the clerk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this wish was immediately gratified , for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd , and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom , which , being a very old one , he deliberately put back again , after trying it on his own countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for this reason , he took the dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him , and the said dodger , being searched , had upon his person a silver snuff - box , with the owner s name engraved upon the lid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you anything to ask this witness , boy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the magistrate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wouldn t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him , replied the dodger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you anything to say at all? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you hear his worship ask if you ve anything to say? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired the jailer , nudging the silent dodger with his elbow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did you redress yourself to me , my man? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never see such an out - and - out young wagabond , your worship , observed the officer with a grin . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - come on , said the jailer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh ah! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s>

<s> <s> you ll pay for this , my fine fellers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here , carry me off to prison! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these last words , the dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar; threatening , till he got into the yard , to make a parliamentary business of it; and then grinning in the officer s face , with great glee and self - approval . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after waiting here some time , he was joined by that young gentleman , who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat , and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but , these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations , though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object , and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her fears for sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept , she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery , she had refused , even for his sake , a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses herand what more could she do! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was resolved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion , they forced themselves upon her , again and again , and left their traces too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at times , she took no heed of what was passing before her , or no part in conversations where once , she would have been the loudest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was sunday night , and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes and the jew were talking , but they paused to listen . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - there never was another man with such a face as yours , unless it was your father , and i suppose he is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time , unless you came straight from the old  un without any father at all betwixt you; which i shouldn t wonder at , a bit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin offered no reply to this compliment: but , pulling sikes by the sleeve , pointed his finger towards nancy , who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet , and was now leaving the room . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - do you hear me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i do , said sikes , more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i want it in the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with which assurance he rose , locked the door , took the key out , and pulling her bonnet from her head , flung it up to the top of an old press . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there , said the robber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now stop quietly where you are , will you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me , said the girl turning very pale . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - let me go , will you ,this minutethis instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - aye! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - not till you let me gonot till you let me gonevernever! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> screamed the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes looked on , for a minute , watching his opportunity , and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her , struggling and wrestling with him by the way , into a small room adjoining , where he sat himself on a bench , and thrusting her into a chair , held her down by force . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she struggled and implored by turns until twelve o clock had struck , and then , wearied and exhausted , ceased to contest the point any further . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with a caution , backed by many oaths , to make no more efforts to go out that night , sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - whew! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may say that , bill , replied fagin thoughtfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you may say that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wot did she take it into her head to go out tonight for , do you think? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come; you should know her better than me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wot does it mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i suppose it is , growled sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thought i had tamed her , but she s as bad as ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - worse , said fagin thoughtfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never knew her like this , for such a little cause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nor i , said sikes . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - like enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll let her a little blood , without troubling the doctor , if she s took that way again , said sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s it , my dear , replied the jew in a whisper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he uttered these words , the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat . </s> </s>

<s> <s> exclaimed sikes , turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and , in a few minutes , the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - light him down , said sikes , who was filling his pipe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> show him a light . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it , nancy , dear? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what do you mean? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied the girl , in the same tone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if hehe pointed with his skinny fore - finger up the stairs - is so hard with you ( he s a brute , nance , a brute - beast ) , why don t you<s> <s>  - well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the girl , as fagin paused , with his mouth almost touching her ear , and his eyes looking into hers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no matter just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we ll talk of this again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have a friend in me , nance; a staunch friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have the means at hand , quiet and close . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> worse than his dog , for he humours him sometimescome to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say , come to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is the mere hound of a day , but you know me of old , nance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she shrank back , as fagin offered to lay his hand on hers , but said good - night again , in a steady voice , and , answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence , closed the door between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin walked towards his home , intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had conceived the ideanot from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him , but slowly and by degreesthat nancy , wearied of the housebreaker s brutality , had conceived an attachment for some new friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her altered manner , her repeated absences from home alone , her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous , and , added to these , her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour , all favoured the supposition , and rendered it , to him at least , almost matter of certainty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as nancy , and must ( thus fagin argued ) be secured without delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was another , and a darker object , to be gained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sikes knew too much , and his ruffian taunts had not galled fagin the less , because the wounds were hidden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl must know , well , that if she shook him off , she could never be safe from his fury , and that it would be surely wreakedto the maiming of limbs , or perhaps the loss of lifeon the object of her more recent fancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with a little persuasion , thought fagin ,  - what more likely than that she would consent to poison him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> women have done such things , and worse , to secure the same object before now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these things passed through the mind of fagin , during the short time he sat alone , in the housebreaker s room; and with them uppermost in his thoughts , he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him , of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no expression of surprise , no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl clearly comprehended it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of sikes , and that was one of the chief ends to be attained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how , thought fagin , as he crept homeward ,  - can i increase my influence with her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what new power can i acquire? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such brains are fertile in expedients . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if , without extracting a confession from herself , he laid a watch , discovered the object of her altered regard , and threatened to reveal the whole history to sikes ( of whom she stood in no common fear ) unless she entered into his designs , could he not secure her compliance? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she durst not refuse me then . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not for her life , not for her life! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have it all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the means are ready , and shall be set to work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man was up , betimes , next morning , and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate , who after a delay that seemed interminable , at length presented himself , and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , here i am , returned noah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s the matter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yer never get time enough over yer meals . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said fagin , cursing his dear young friend s greediness from the very bottom of his heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i get on better when i talk , said noah , cutting a monstrous slice of bread . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - out , said fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i sent her out this morning with the other young woman , because i wanted us to be alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wish yer d ordered her to make some buttered toast first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> talk away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yer won t interrupt me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there seemed , indeed , no great fear of anything interrupting him , as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - beautiful! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , no , my dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pint - pots were great strokes of genius: but the milk - can was a perfect masterpiece . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bolter complacently . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the pots i took off airy railings , and the milk - can was standing by itself outside a public - house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought it might get rusty with the rain , or catch cold , yer know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bolter having had his laugh out , took a series of large bites , which finished his first hunk of bread and butter , and assisted himself to a second . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i want you , bolter , said fagin , leaning over the table ,  - to do a piece of work for me , my dear , that needs great care and caution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i say , rejoined bolter ,  - don t yer go shoving me into danger , or sending me any more o  yer police - offices . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s not the smallest danger in itnot the very smallest , said the jew;  - it s only to dodge a woman . </s> </s>

<s> <s> not to<s> <s>  - not to do anything , but to tell me where she goes , who she sees , and , if possible , what she says; to remember the street , if it is a street , or the house , if it is a house; and to bring me back all the information you can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what ll yer give me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one pound , said fagin , wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and that s what i never gave yet , for any job of work where there wasn t valuable consideration to be gained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquired noah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried noah , curling up his nose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see , said noah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just to have the pleasure of knowing them , if they re respectable people , eh? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ha! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i m your man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i knew you would be , cried fagin , elated by the success of his proposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where is she? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where am i to wait for her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ll point her out at the proper time , said fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you keep ready , and leave the rest to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that night , and the next , and the next again , the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter s dress: ready to turn out at a word from fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> six nights passedsix long weary nightsand on each , fagin came home with a disappointed face , and briefly intimated that it was not yet time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the seventh , he returned earlier , and with an exultation he could not conceal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was sunday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she goes abroad tonight , said fagin ,  - and on the right errand , i m sure; for she has been alone all day , and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> quick! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noah started up without saying a word; for the jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they left the house stealthily , and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets , arrived at length before a public - house , which noah recognised as the same in which he had slept , on the night of his arrival in london . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was past eleven o clock , and the door was closed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it opened softly on its hinges as fagin gave a low whistle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> scarcely venturing to whisper , but substituting dumb show for words , fagin , and the young jew who had admitted them , pointed out the pane of glass to noah , and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is that the woman? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked , scarcely above his breath . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i can t see her face well , whispered noah . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she is looking down , and the candle is behind her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stay there , whispered fagin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he signed to barney , who withdrew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see her now , cried the spy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should know her among a thousand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off , and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment , and emerged by the door at which they had entered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the lad who held the door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noah exchanged a look with fagin , and darted out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to the left , whispered the lad;  - take the left had , and keep od the other side . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she looked nervously round , twice or thrice , and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her , pass on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she seemed to gather courage as she advanced , and to walk with a steadier and firmer step . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the spy preserved the same relative distance between them , and followed: with his eye upon her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven , as two figures emerged on london bridge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , they crossed the bridge , from the middlesex to the surrey shore , when the woman , apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot - passengers , turned back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before , he slipped quietly down , and followed her again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at nearly the centre of the bridge , she stopped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man stopped too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such as there were , hurried quickly past: very possibly without seeing , but certainly without noticing , either the woman , or the man who kept her in view . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of london s destitute population , as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence: neither speaking nor spoken to , by any one who passed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a mist hung over the river , deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs , and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the tower of old saint saviour s church , and the spire of saint magnus , so long the giant - warders of the ancient bridge , were visible in the gloom; but the forest of shipping below bridge , and the thickly scattered spires of churches above , were nearly all hidden from sight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl had taken a few restless turns to and froclosely watched meanwhile by her hidden observerwhen the heavy bell of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> midnight had come upon the crowded city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the palace , the night - cellar , the jail , the madhouse: the chambers of birth and death , of health and sickness , the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child: midnight was upon them all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hour had not struck two minutes , when a young lady , accompanied by a grey - haired gentleman , alighted from a hackney - carriage within a short distance of the bridge , and , having dismissed the vehicle , walked straight towards it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had scarcely set foot upon its pavement , when the girl started , and immediately made towards them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not here , said nancy hurriedly ,  - i am afraid to speak to you here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come awayout of the public roaddown the steps yonder! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she uttered these words , and indicated , with her hand , the direction in which she wished them to proceed , the countryman looked round , and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for , passed on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this spot , the man bearing the appearance of a countryman , hastened unobserved; and after a moment s survey of the place , he began to descend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle of the wall , is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him , if only a step . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the countryman looked hastily round , when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment , and , the tide being out , there was plenty of room , he slipped aside , with his back to the pilaster , and there waited: pretty certain that they would come no lower , and that even if he could not hear what was said , he could follow them again , with safety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so tardily stole the time in this lonely place , and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect , that he more than once gave the matter up for lost , and persuaded himself , either that they had stopped far above , or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he drew himself straight upright against the wall , and , scarcely breathing , listened attentively . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is far enough , said a voice , which was evidently that of the gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will not suffer the young lady to go any farther . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far , but you see i am willing to humour you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to humour me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you re considerate , indeed , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to humour me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , for what , said the gentleman in a kinder tone ,  - for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i told you before , replied nancy ,  - that i was afraid to speak to you there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i don t know why it is , said the girl , shuddering ,  - but i have such a fear and dread upon me tonight that i can hardly stand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the gentleman , who seemed to pity her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wish i did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was reading a book tonight , to wile the time away , and the same things came into the print . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - imagination , said the gentleman , soothing her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no imagination , replied the girl in a hoarse voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll swear i saw coffin  written in every page of the book in large black letters ,aye , and they carried one close to me , in the streets tonight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is nothing unusual in that , said the gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - real ones , rejoined the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this was not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was something so uncommon in her manner , that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words , and the blood chilled within him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm , and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - speak to her kindly , said the young lady to her companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - poor creature! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as i am tonight , and preached of flames and vengeance , cried the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , dear lady , why ar n t those who claim to be god s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you , who , having youth , and beauty , and all that they have lost , might be a little proud instead of so much humbler? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a turk turns his face , after washing it well , to the east , when he says his prayers; these good people , after giving their faces such a rub against the world as to take the smiles off , turn with no less regularity , to the darkest side of heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> between the mussulman and the pharisee , commend me to the first! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these words appeared to be addressed to the young lady , and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording nancy time to recover herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gentleman , shortly afterwards , addressed himself to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you were not here last sunday night , he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i couldn t come , replied nancy;  - i was kept by force . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - him that i told the young lady of before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here tonight , i hope? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied the girl , shaking her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did he awake before you returned? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - good , said the gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - now listen to me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this young lady , the gentleman began ,  - has communicated to me , and to some other friends who can be safely trusted , what you told her nearly a fortnight since . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i confess to you that i had doubts , at first , whether you were to be implicitly relied upon , but now i firmly believe you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am , said the girl earnestly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i repeat that i firmly believe it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to prove to you that i am disposed to trust you , i tell you without reserve , that we propose to extort the secret , whatever it may be , from the fear of this man monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but ifif said the gentleman ,  - he cannot be secured , or , if secured , cannot be acted upon as we wish , you must deliver up the jew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fagin , cried the girl , recoiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that man must be delivered up by you , said the gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will never do it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the gentleman , who seemed fully prepared for this answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - never! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> returned the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me why? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for one reason , rejoined the girl firmly ,  - for one reason , that the lady knows and will stand by me in , i know she will , for i have her promise: and for this other reason , besides , that , bad life as he has led , i have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same courses together , and i ll not turn upon them , who mightany of themhave turned upon me , but didn t , bad as they are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , said the gentleman , quickly , as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain;  - put monks into my hands , and leave him to me to deal with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what if he turns against the others? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i promise you that in that case , if the truth is forced from him , there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in oliver s little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye , and if the truth is once elicited , they shall go scot free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and if it is not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suggested the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , pursued the gentleman ,  - this fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in such a case i could show you reasons , i think , which would induce you to yield it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the intelligence should be brought to bear upon him , that he could never even guess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the manner in which she occasionally paused , it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don t forget that , for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man s , that you might almost tell him by that alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his face is dark , like his hair and eyes; and , although he can t be more than six or eight and twenty , withered and haggard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits , and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with woundswhy did you start? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the girl , stopping suddenly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the gentleman replied , in a hurried manner , that he was not conscious of having done so , and begged her to proceed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - part of this , said the girl ,  - i have drawn out from other people at the house i tell you of , for i have only seen him twice , and both times he was covered up in a large cloak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stay though , she added . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - upon his throat: so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face: there is<s> <s>  - a broad red mark , like a burn or scald? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how s this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the young lady uttered a cry of surprise , and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think i do , said the gentleman , breaking silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should by your description . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we shall see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many people are singularly like each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it may not be the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what can i do to serve you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will not persist in saying that , rejoined the gentleman , with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - think now . </s> </s>

<s> <s> without one pause , or moment s consideration; without once turning his head to the right or left , or raising his eyes to the sky , or lowering them to the ground , but looking straight before him with savage resolution: his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong course , nor muttered a word , nor relaxed a muscle , until he reached his own door . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the robber sat regarding her , for a few seconds , with dilated nostrils and heaving breast; and then , grasping her by the head and throat , dragged her into the middle of the room , and looking once towards the door , placed his heavy hand upon her mouth . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the man struggled violently , to release his arms; but those of the girl were clasped round his , and tear her as he would , he could not tear them away . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he had not moved; he had been afraid to stir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there had been a moan and motion of the hand; and , with terror added to rage , he had struck and struck again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the eyes , and imagine them moving towards him , than to see them glaring upward , as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had plucked it off again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and there was the bodymere flesh and blood , no morebut such flesh , and so much blood! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was hair upon the end , which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder , and , caught by the air , whirled up the chimney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he washed himself , and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be removed , but he cut the pieces out , and burnt them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how those stains were dispersed about the room! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the very feet of the dog were bloody . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such preparations completed , he moved , backward , towards the door: dragging the dog with him , lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shut the door softly , locked it , took the key , and left the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he crossed over , and glanced up at the window , to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside . </s> </s>

<s> <s> traversing the hollow by the vale of heath , he mounted the opposite bank , and crossing the road which joins the villages of hampstead and highgate , made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at north end , in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge , and slept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon he was up again , and away ,not far into the country , but back towards london by the high - roadthen back againthen over another part of the same ground as he already traversedthen wandering up and down in fields , and lying on ditches  brinks to rest , and starting up to make for some other spot , and do the same , and ramble on again . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but when he got there , all the people he metthe very children at the doorsseemed to view him with suspicion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> back he turned again , without the courage to purchase bit or drop , though he had tasted no food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the heath , uncertain where to go . </s> </s>

<s> <s> morning and noon had passed , and the day was on the wane , and still he rambled to and fro , and up and down , and round and round , and still lingered about the same spot . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was nine o clock at night , when the man , quite tired out , and the dog , limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise , turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village , and plodding along the little street , crept into a small public - house , whose scanty light had guided them to the spot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they made room for the stranger , but he sat down in the furthest corner , and ate and drank alone , or rather with his dog: to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the conversation of the men assembled here , turned upon the neighbouring land , and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted , upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous sunday; the young men present considering him very old , and the old men present declaring him to have been quite youngnot older , one white - haired grandfather said , than he waswith ten or fifteen year of life in him at leastif he had taken care; if he had taken care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the robber , after paying his reckoning , sat silent and unnoticed in his corner , and had almost dropped asleep , when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - he has gone to birmingham , they say , said one:  - but they ll have him yet , for the scouts are out , and by tomorrow night there ll be a cry all through the country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wandered on again , irresolute and undecided , and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suddenly , he took the desperate resolution to going back to london . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a good hiding - place , too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they ll never expect to nab me there , after this country scent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why can t i lie by for a week or so , and , forcing blunt from fagin , get abroad to france? </s> </s>

<s> <s> he acted upon this impulse without delay , and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back , resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis , and , entering it at dusk by a circuitous route , to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if any description of him were out , it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing , and had probably gone with him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> come here! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the animal came up from the very force of habit; but as sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat , he uttered a low growl and started back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - come back! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the robber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dog wagged his tail , but moved not . </s> </s>

<s> <s> brownlow alighted from a hackney - coach at his own door , and knocked softly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , they helped out a third man , and taking him between them , hurried him into the house . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man was monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the door of this apartment , monks , who had ascended with evident reluctance , stopped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he knows the alternative , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him , drag him into the street , call for the aid of the police , and impeach him as a felon in my name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how dare you say this of me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , confronting him with a steady look . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are you mad enough to leave this house? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> unhand him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there , sir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you are free to go , and we to follow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i warn you , by all i hold most solemn and most sacred , that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - by mine , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you complain of being deprived of your libertyyou had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along , but you deemed it advisable to remain quieti say again , throw yourself for protection on the law . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far to recede , do not sue to me for leniency , when the power will have passed into other hands; and do not say i plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed , yourself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monks was plainly disconcerted , and alarmed besides . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he hesitated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will decide quickly , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , with perfect firmness and composure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you wish me to prefer my charges publicly , and consign you to a punishment the extent of which , although i can , with a shudder , foresee , i cannot control , once more , i say , for you know the way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monks muttered some unintelligible words , but wavered still . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will be prompt , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a word from me , and the alternative has gone for ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still the man hesitated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have not the inclination to parley , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow ,  - and , as i advocate the dearest interests of others , i have not the right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - is there demanded monks with a faltering tongue , - is thereno middle course? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - none . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monks looked at the old gentleman , with an anxious eye; but , reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination , walked into the room , and , shrugging his shoulders , sat down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the men obeyed , and the two were left alone together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is pretty treatment , sir , said monks , throwing down his hat and cloak ,  - from my father s oldest friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is because i was your father s oldest friend , young man , returned mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow;  - it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him , and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her god in youth , and left me here a solitary , lonely man: it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters s death - bed when he was yet a boy , on the morning that wouldbut heaven willed otherwisehave made her my young wife; it is because my seared heart clung to him , from that time forth , through all his trials and errors , till he died; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart , and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all these things that i am moved to treat you gently nowyes , edward leeford , even nowand blush for your unworthiness who bear the name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the other , after contemplating , half in silence , and half in dogged wonder , the agitation of his companion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is the name to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow ,  - nothing to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was hers , and even at this distance of time brings back to me , an old man , the glow and thrill which i once felt , only to hear it repeated by a stranger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is all mighty fine , said monks ( to retain his assumed designation ) after a long silence , during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro , and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow had sat , shading his face with his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what do you want with me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have a brother , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , rousing himself:  - a brother , the whisper of whose name in your ear when i came behind you in the street , was , in itself , almost enough to make you accompany me hither , in wonder and alarm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have no brother , replied monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know i was an only child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why do you talk to me of brothers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - attend to what i do know , and you may not , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall interest you by and by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t care for hard names , interrupted monks with a jeering laugh . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you know the fact , and that s enough for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave place to dislike , dislike to hate , and hate to loathing , until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder , and retiring a wide space apart , carried each a galling fragment , of which nothing but death could break the rivets , to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it rusted and cankered at your father s heart for years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , they were separated , said monks ,  - and what of that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow ,  - and your mother , wholly given up to continental frivolities , had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior , who , with prospects blighted , lingered on at home , he fell among new friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not i , said monks , turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground , as a man who is determined to deny everything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not i . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your manner , no less than your actions , assures me that you have never forgotten it , or ceased to think of it with bitterness , returned mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i speak of fifteen years ago , when you were not more than eleven years old , and your father but one - and - thirtyfor he was , i repeat , a boy , when his father ordered him to marry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have nothing to disclose , rejoined monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - these new friends , then , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow ,  - were a naval officer retired from active service , whose wife had died some half - a - year before , and left him with two childrenthere had been more , but , of all their family , happily but two survived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s this to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> acquaintance , intimacy , friendship , fast followed on each other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your father was gifted as few men are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as the old officer knew him more and more , he grew to love him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would that it had ended there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his daughter did the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old gentleman paused; monks was biting his lips , with his eyes fixed upon the floor; seeing this , he immediately resumed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your tale is of the longest , observed monks , moving restlessly in his chair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a true tale of grief and trial , and sorrow , young man , returned mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow ,  - and such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness , it would be very brief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed , as others are oftenit is no uncommon casedied , and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning , left him his panacea for all griefsmoney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was necessary that he should immediately repair to rome , whither this man had sped for health , and where he had died , leaving his affairs in great confusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow paused , he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief , and wiped his hot face and hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - before he went abroad , and as he passed through london on his way , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i never heard of that , interrupted monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous , but savouring more of disagreeable surprise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked in a wild , distracted way , of ruin and dishonour worked by himself; confided to me his intention to convert his whole property , at any loss , into money , and , having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition , to fly the countryi guessed too well he would not fly aloneand never see it more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> alas! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that was the last time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i went , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the family had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding , discharged them , and left the place by night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monks drew his breath yet more freely , and looked round with a smile of triumph . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when your brother , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by me , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i told you i should interest you before long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say by mei see that your cunning associate suppressed my name , although for aught he knew , it would be quite strange to your ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even when i first saw him in all his dirt and misery , there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i need not tell you he was snared away before i knew his history<s> <s>  - why not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked monks hastily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because you know it well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - denial to me is vain , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i shall show you that i know more than that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - youyoucan t prove anything against me , stammered monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i defy you to do it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we shall see , returned the old gentleman with a searching glance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> your agents had no clue to your residence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you came and went , they said , as strangely as you had ever done: sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months: keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i wearied them with new applications . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i paced the streets by night and day , but until two hours ago , all my efforts were fruitless , and i never saw you for an instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and now you do see me , said monks , rising boldly ,  - what then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you don t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you don t even know that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have a brother; you know it , and him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a will , which your mother destroyed , leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection , which child was born , and accidentally encountered by you , when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you repaired to the place of his birth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there existed proofsproofs long suppressedof his birth and parentage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those proofs were destroyed by you , and now , in your own words to your accomplice the jew , the only proofs of the boy s identity lie at the bottom of the river , and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  unworthy son , coward , liar ,you , who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night ,you , whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you ,you , who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father s heart , and in whom all evil passions , vice , and profligacy , festered , till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mindyou , edward leeford , do you still brave me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - every word! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ii knew nothing of that; i was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i didn t know the cause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought it was a common quarrel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was the partial disclosure of your secrets , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - will you disclose the whole? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , i will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - set your hand to a statement of truth and facts , and repeat it before witnesses? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that i promise too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - remain quietly here , until such a document is drawn up , and proceed with me to such a place as i may deem most advisable , for the purpose of attesting it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you must do more than that , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - make restitution to an innocent and unoffending child , for such he is , although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you have not forgotten the provisions of the will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned , and then go where you please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while monks was pacing up and down , meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it: torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other: the door was hurriedly unlocked , and a gentleman ( mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne ) entered the room in violent agitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the man will be taken , he cried . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he will be taken tonight! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the murderer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , replied the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - his dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt , and there seems little doubt that his master either is , or will be , there , under cover of the darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> spies are hovering about in every direction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture , and they tell me he cannot escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will give fifty more , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as he had seen your friend here , safe in a coach with you , he hurried off to where he heard this , replied the doctor ,  - and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow;  - what of him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when i last heard , he had not been taken , but he will be , or is , by this time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they re sure of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have you made up your mind? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , in a low voice , of monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> remain here till i return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is your only hope of safety . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they left the room , and the door was again locked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the doctor in a whisper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all that i could hope to do , and even more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> coupling the poor girl s intelligence with my previous knowledge , and the result of our good friend s inquiries on the spot , i left him no loophole of escape , and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> write and appoint the evening after tomorrow , at seven , for the meeting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we shall be down there , a few hours before , but shall require rest: especially the young lady , who may have greater need of firmness than either you or i can quite foresee just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> which way have they taken? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will remain here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> near to that part of the thames on which the church at rotherhithe abuts , where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close - built low - roofed houses , there exists the filthiest , the strangest , the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in london , wholly unknown , even by name , to the great mass of its inhabitants . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to reach this place , the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close , narrow , and muddy streets , thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people , and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman s door , and stream from the house - parapet and windows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in such a neighbourhood , beyond dockhead in the borough of southwark , stands jacob s island , surrounded by a muddy ditch , six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in , once called mill pond , but known in the days of this story as folly ditch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a creek or inlet from the thames , and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the lead mills from which it took its old name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at such times , a stranger , looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at mill lane , will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows , buckets , pails , domestic utensils of all kinds , in which to haul the water up; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves , his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses , with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows , broken and patched , with poles thrust out , on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small , so filthy , so confined , that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud , and threatening to fall into itas some have done; dirt - besmeared walls and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty , every loathsome indication of filth , rot , and garbage; all these ornament the banks of folly ditch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in jacob s island , the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened , but they yield no smoke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thirty or forty years ago , before losses and chancery suits came upon it , it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they must have powerful motives for a secret residence , or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed , who seek a refuge in jacob s island . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in an upper room of one of these housesa detached house of fair size , ruinous in other respects , but strongly defended at door and window: of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already describedthere were assembled three men , who , regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation , sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of these was toby crackit , another mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this man was a returned transport , and his name was kags . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i wish , said toby turning to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> chitling ,  - that you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm , and had not come here , my fine feller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why didn t you , blunder - head! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i thought you d have been a little more glad to see me than this , replied mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> chitling , with a melancholy air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why , look e , young gentleman , said toby ,  - when a man keeps himself so very ex - clusive as i have done , and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it , it s rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman ( however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency ) circumstanced as you are . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a short silence , after which toby crackit , seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil - may - care swagger , turned to chitling and said ,<s> <s>  - when was fagin took then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just at dinner - timetwo o clock this afternoon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> charley and i made our lucky up the wash - us chimney , and bolter got into the empty water - butt , head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top , and so they took him too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> demanded kags . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he hung about , not to come over here afore dark , but he ll be here soon , replied chitling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there s nowhere else to go to now , for the people at the cripples are all in custody , and the bar of the keni went up there and see it with my own eyesis filled with traps . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is a smash , observed toby , biting his lips . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there s more than one will go with this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you should have heard the people groan , said chitling;  - the officers fought like devils , or they d have torn him away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was down once , but they made a ring round him , and fought their way along . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you should have seen how he looked about him , all muddy and bleeding , and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the horror - stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears , and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro , like one distracted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was thus engaged , and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor , a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs , and sikes s dog bounded into the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they ran to the window , downstairs , and into the street . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dog had jumped in at an open window; he made no attempt to follow them , nor was his master to be seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what s the meaning of this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said toby when they had returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he can t be coming here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> iihope not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if he was coming here , he d have come with the dog , said kags , stooping down to examine the animal , who lay panting on the floor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s drunk it all up , every drop , said chitling after watching the dog some time in silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - covered with mudlamehalf blindhe must have come a long way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - where can he have come from! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed toby . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he s been to the other kens of course , and finding them filled with strangers come on here , where he s been many a time and often . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but where can he have come from first , and how comes he here alone without the other! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he( none of them called the murderer by his old name ) - he can t have made away with himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said chitling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> toby shook his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it being now dark , the shutter was closed , and a candle lighted and placed upon the table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three , increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they spoke little , and that in whispers , and were as silent and awe - stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had sat thus , some time , when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the knocking came again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he never knocked like that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> crackit went to the window , and shaking all over , drew in his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we must let him in , he said , taking up the candle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked the other man in a hoarse voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - none . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he must come in . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don t leave us in the dark , said kags , taking down a candle from the chimney - piece , and lighting it , with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> crackit went down to the door , and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief , and another tied over his head under his hat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he drew them slowly off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> blanched face , sunken eyes , hollow cheeks , beard of three days  growth , wasted flesh , short thick breath; it was the very ghost of sikes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room , but shuddering as he was about to drop into it , and seeming to glance over his shoulder , dragged it back close to the wallas close as it would goand ground it against itand sat down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he looked from one to another in silence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if an eye were furtively raised and met his , it was instantly averted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when his hollow voice broke silence , they all three started . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they seemed never to have heard its tones before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how came that dog here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it true , or a lie? </s> </s>

<s> <s> strokes , thick and heavy , rattled upon the door and lower window - shutters as he ceased to speak , and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener , for the first time , some adequate idea of its immense extent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - open the door of some place where i can lock this screeching hell - babe , cried sikes fiercely; running to and fro , and dragging the boy , now , as easily as if he were an empty sack . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - do your worst! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i ll cheat you yet! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> among them all , none showed such fury as the man on horseback , who , throwing himself out of the saddle , and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water , cried , beneath the window , in a voice that rose above all others ,  - twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder! </s> </s>

<s> <s> all the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up , except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked , and that was too small even for the passage of his body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , from this aperture , he had never ceased to call on those without , to guard the back; and thus , when the murderer emerged at last on the house - top by the door in the roof , a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front , who immediately began to pour round , pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he planted a board , which he had carried up with him for the purpose , so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles , looked over the low parapet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the water was out , and the ditch a bed of mud . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the crowd had been hushed during these few moments , watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose , but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated , they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on pressed the people from the fronton , on , on , in a strong struggling current of angry faces , with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up , and show them out in all their wrath and passion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes were thrown up , or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house - top . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> each little bridge ( and there were three in sight ) bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts , and only for an instant see the wretch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they have him now , cried a man on the nearest bridge . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hurrah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will give fifty pounds , cried an old gentleman from the same quarter ,  - to the man who takes him alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will remain here , till he come to ask me for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last , and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the stream abruptly turned , as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows , seeing those upon the bridges pouring back , quitted their stations , and running into the street , joined the concourse that now thronged pell - mell to the spot they had left: each man crushing and striving with his neighbour , and all panting with impatience to get near the door , and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation , or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion , were dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time , between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house , and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass , the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer , although the universal eagerness for his capture was , if possible , increased . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man had shrunk down , thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd , and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred , he sprang upon his feet , determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch , and , at the risk of being stifled , endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> roused into new strength and energy , and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected , he set his foot against the stack of chimneys , fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it , and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm - pits , and when the old gentleman before - mentioned ( who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd , and retain his position ) earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself downat that very instant the murderer , looking behind him on the roof , threw his arms above his head , and uttered a yell of terror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the eyes again! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cried in an unearthly screech . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> staggering as if struck by lightning , he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy , thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view , called to the people to come and take him out , for god s sake . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> missing his aim , he fell into the ditch , turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone , dashed out his brains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie , and rose , and mrs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bedwin , and the good doctor were with him: and mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow followed in a post - chaise , accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had not talked much upon the way; for oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts , and almost of speech , and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions , who shared it , in at least an equal degree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun , still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was quite true , he said ,  - that they must know them before long , but it might be at a better time than the present , and it could not be at a worse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , they travelled on in silence: each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together: and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but if oliver , under these influences , had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth - place by a road he had never seen , how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times , and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast , when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot: a poor houseless , wandering boy , without a friend to help him , or a roof to shelter his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - see there , there! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried oliver , eagerly clasping the hand of rose , and pointing out at the carriage window;  - that s the stile i came over; there are the hedges i crept behind , for fear any one should overtake me and force me back! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yonder is the path across the fields , leading to the old house where i was a little child! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh dick , dick , my dear old friend , if i could only see you now! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will see him soon , replied rose , gently taking his folded hands between her own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , yes , said oliver ,  - and we llwe ll take him away from here , and have him clothed and taught , and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and well ,shall we? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rose nodded  - yes , for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you will be kind and good to him , for you are to every one , said oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it will make you cry , i know , to hear what he can tell; but never mind , never mind , it will be all over , and you will smile againi know that tooto think how changed he is; you did the same with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said god bless you  to me when i ran away , cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion;  - and i will say god bless you  now , and show him how i love him for it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they approached the town , and at length drove through its narrow streets , it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds . </s> </s>

<s> <s> there was dinner prepared , and there were bedrooms ready , and everything was arranged as if by magic . </s> </s>

<s> <s> brownlow , who had papers in his hand , walked to a table near which rose and oliver were seated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is a painful task , said he ,  - but these declarations , which have been signed in london before many gentlemen , must be in substance repeated here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i would have spared you the degradation , but we must hear them from your own lips before we part , and you know why . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - quick . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this child , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is the bastard child . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the term you use , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , sternly ,  - is a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it reflects disgrace on no one living , except you who use it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let that pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was born in this town . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the workhouse of this town , was the sullen reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have the story there . </s> </s>

<s> <s> returned monks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he knew nothing of us , for his senses were gone , and he slumbered on till next day , when he died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> among the papers in his desk , were two , dated on the night his illness first came on , directed to yourself; he addressed himself to mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of these papers was a letter to this girl agnes; the other a will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the letter? a sheet of paper crossed and crossed again , with a penitent confession , and prayers to god to help her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was , at that time , within a few months of her confinement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he told her all he had meant to do , to hide her shame , if he had lived , and prayed her , if he died , not to curse his memory , or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child; for all the guilt was his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i believe he had . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the will , said mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , as oliver s tears fell fast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , speaking for him ,  - was in the same spirit as the letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bulk of his property he divided into two equal portionsone for agnes fleming , and the other for their child , if it should be born alive , and ever come of age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he were disappointed in this expectation , then the money was to come to you: for then , and not till then , when both children were equal , would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse , who had none upon his heart , but had , from an infant , repulsed him with coldness and aversion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my mother , said monks , in a louder tone ,  - did what a woman should have done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of wales , changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat; and here , no great while afterwards , he was found dead in his bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girl had left her home , in secret , some weeks before; he had searched for her , on foot , in every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home , assured that she had destroyed herself , to hide her shame and his , that his old heart broke . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was a short silence here , until mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had left her , when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and money; gambled , squandered , forged , and fled to london: where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was sinking under a painful and incurable disease , and wished to recover him before she died . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> inquiries were set on foot , and strict searches made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were unavailing for a long time , but ultimately successful; and he went back with her to france . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself , and the child too , but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born , and was alive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i swore to her , if ever it crossed my path , to hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that i deeply felt , and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by dragging it , if i could , to the very gallows - foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was right . </s> </s>

<s> <s> as the villain folded his arms tight together , and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him , and explained that the jew , who had been his old accomplice and confidant , had a large reward for keeping oliver ensnared: of which some part was to be given up , in the event of his being rescued: and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner , what he had had , and where he had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the judge assumed the black cap , and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a woman in the gallery , uttered some exclamation , called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption , and bent forward yet more attentively . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he gazed stupidly about him for an instant , and obeyed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they led him through a paved room under the court , where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came , and others were talking to their friends , who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shook his fist , and would have spat upon them; but his conductors hurried him on , through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps , into the interior of the prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he sat down on a stone bench opposite the door , which served for seat and bedstead; and casting his blood - shot eyes upon the ground , tried to collect his thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after awhile , he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed to him , at the time , that he could not hear a word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these gradually fell into their proper places , and by degrees suggested more: so that in a little time he had the whole , almost as it was delivered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to be hanged by the neck , till he was deadthat was the end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as it came on very dark , he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they rose up , in such quick succession , that he could hardly count them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had seen some of them die ,and had joked too , because they died with prayers upon their lips . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at length , when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls , two men appeared: one bearing a candle , which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then came the nightdark , dismal , silent night . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was another form of knell , with mockery added to the warning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day passed off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no day; it was gone as soon as comeand night came on again; night so long , and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence , and short in its fleeting hours . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he had only one night more to live . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not until the night of this last awful day , that a withering sense of his helpless , desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy , but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had spoken little to either of the two men , who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and they , for their parts , made no effort to rouse his attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he grew so terrible , at last , in all the tortures of his evil conscience , that one man could not bear to sit there , eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he cowered down upon his stone bed , and thought of the past . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture , and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his red hair hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn , and twisted into knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at eight , he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train; at eleven<s> <s> those dreadful walls of newgate , which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish , not only from the eyes , but , too often , and too long , from the thoughts , of men , never held so dread a spectacle as that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the few who lingered as they passed , and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged tomorrow , would have slept but ill that night , if they could have seen him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from early in the evening until nearly midnight , little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge - gate , and inquired , with anxious faces , whether any reprieve had been received . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by degrees they fell off , one by one; and , for an hour , in the dead of night , the street was left to solitude and darkness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the space before the prison was cleared , and a few strong barriers , painted black , had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd , when mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> said the man whose duty it was to conduct them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not indeed , my friend , rejoined mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow;  - but my business with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy , i think it as welleven at the cost of some pain and fearthat he should see him now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these few words had been said apart , so as to be inaudible to oliver . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man touched his hat; and glancing at oliver with some curiousity , opened another gate , opposite to that by which they had entered , and led them on , through dark and winding ways , towards the cells . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this , said the man , stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence - this is the place he passes through . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you step this way , you can see the door he goes out at . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he led them into a stone kitchen , fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food , and pointed to a door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were putting up the scaffold . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from this place , they passed through several strong gates , opened by other turnkeys from the inner side; and , having entered an open yard , ascended a flight of narrow steps , and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> motioning them to remain where they were , the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two attendants , after a little whispering , came out into the passage , stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief , and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the condemned criminal was seated on his bed , rocking himself from side to side , with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you had better leave him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the door of the cell opened , and the attendants returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the men laid hands upon him , and disengaging oliver from his grasp , held him back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he struggled with the power of desperation , for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls , and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was some time before they left the prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene , and was so weak that for an hour or more , he had not the strength to walk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> day was dawning when they again emerged . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before three months had passed , rose fleming and harry maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman s labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter - in - law , to enjoy , during the tranquil remainder of her days , the greatest felicity that age and worth can knowthe contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well - spent life , have been unceasingly bestowed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it appeared , on full and careful investigation , that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of monks ( which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother ) were equally divided between himself and oliver , it would yield , to each , little more than three thousand pounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the provisions of his father s will , oliver would have been entitled to the whole; but mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow , unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career , proposed this mode of distribution , to which his young charge joyfully acceded . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> monks , still bearing that assumed name , retired with his portion to a distant part of the new world; where , having quickly squandered it , he once more fell into his old courses , and , after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery , at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder , and died in prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow adopted oliver as his son . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon after the marriage of the young people , the worthy doctor returned to chertsey , where , bereft of the presence of his old friends , he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for two or three months , he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him; then , finding that the place really no longer was , to him , what it had been , he settled his business on his assistant , took a bachelor s cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor , and instantaneously recovered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here he took to gardening , planting , fishing , carpentering , and various other pursuits of a similar kind: all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighbourhood , as a most profound authority . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before his removal , he had managed to contract a strong friendship for mr . </s> </s>

<s> <s> on all such occasions , mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig plants , fishes , and carpenters , with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner , but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration , that his mode is the right one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on sundays , he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman s face: always informing mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> losberne , in strict confidence afterwards , that he considers it an excellent performance , but deems it as well not to say so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning oliver , and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them , waiting his return; but mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> grimwig contends that he was right in the main , and , in proof thereof , remarks that oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on his side , and increases his good humour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mr . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> noah claypole: receiving a free pardon from the crown in consequence of being admitted approver against fagin: and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was , for some little time , at a loss for the means of a livelihood , not burdened with too much work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after some consideration , he went into business as an informer , in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence . </s> </s>

<s> <s> he struggled hard , and suffered much , for some time; but , having a contented disposition , and a good purpose , succeeded in the end; and , from being a farmer s drudge , and a carrier s lad , he is now the merriest young grazier in all northamptonshire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and now , the hand that traces these words , falters , as it approaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave , for a little longer space , the thread of these adventures . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart , and gratitude to that being whose code is mercy , and whose great attribute is benevolence to all things that breathe , happiness can never be attained . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many , many years , before another name is placed above it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , if the spirits of the dead ever come back to earth , to visit spots hallowed by the lovethe love beyond the graveof those whom they knew in life , i believe that the shade of agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i believe it none the less because that nook is in a church , and she was weak and erring . </s> </s>
