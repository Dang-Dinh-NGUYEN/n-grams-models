<s> <s> his fine old crusted english would , no doubt , be relished by a minority , but it would be only by a minority . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his warmest admirers must admit that he is not a satisfactory representative of cervantes . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it is often very literalbarbarously literal frequentlybut just as often very loose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had evidently a good colloquial knowledge of spanish , but apparently not much more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it never seems to occur to him that the same translation of a word will not suit in every case . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to those who are familiar with the original , it savours of truism or platitude to say so , for in truth there can be no thoroughly satisfactory translation of  - don quixote into english or any other language . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not that the spanish idioms are so utterly unmanageable , or that the untranslatable words , numerous enough no doubt , are so superabundant , but rather that the sententious terseness to which the humour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to spanish , and can at best be only distantly imitated in any other tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the history of our english translations of  - don quixote is instructive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this of course was only the first part . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it has been asserted that the second , published in 1620 , is not the work of shelton , but there is nothing to support the assertion save the fact that it has less spirit , less of what we generally understand by  - go , about it than the first , which would be only natural if the first were the work of a young man writing currente calamo , and the second that of a middle - aged man writing for a bookseller . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the other hand , it is closer and more literal , the style is the same , the very same translations , or mistranslations , occur in it , and it is extremely unlikely that a new translator would , by suppressing his name , have allowed shelton to carry off the credit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in 1687 john phillips , milton s nephew , produced a  - don quixote  - made english , he says ,  - according to the humour of our modern language . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his  - quixote is not so much a translation as a travesty , and a travesty that for coarseness , vulgarity , and buffoonery is almost unexampled even in the literature of that day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ned ward s  - life and notable adventures of don quixote , merrily translated into hudibrastic verse ( 1700 ) , can scarcely be reckoned a translation , but it serves to show the light in which  - don quixote was regarded at the time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 by peter motteux , who had then recently combined tea - dealing with literature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is described as  - translated from the original by several hands , but if so all spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under the manipulation of the several hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the flavour that it has , on the other hand , is distinctly franco - cockney . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anyone who compares it carefully with the original will have little doubt that it is a concoction from shelton and the french of filleau de saint martin , eked out by borrowings from phillips , whose mode of treatment it adopts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is , to be sure , more decent and decorous , but it treats  - don quixote in the same fashion as a comic book that cannot be made too comic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it had the effect , however , of bringing out a translation undertaken and executed in a very different spirit , that of charles jervas , the portrait painter , and friend of pope , swift , arbuthnot , and gay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jervas has been allowed little credit for his work , indeed it may be said none , for it is known to the world in general as jarvis s . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not published until after his death , and the printers gave the name according to the current pronunciation of the day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it has been the most freely used and the most freely abused of all the translations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it has seen far more editions than any other , it is admitted on all hands to be by far the most faithful , and yet nobody seems to have a good word to say for it or for its author . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> jervas no doubt prejudiced readers against himself in his preface , where among many true words about shelton , stevens , and motteux , he rashly and unjustly charges shelton with having translated not from the spanish , but from the italian version of franciosini , which did not appear until ten years after shelton s first volume . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a suspicion of incompetence , too , seems to have attached to him because he was by profession a painter and a mediocre one ( though he has given us the best portrait we have of swift ) , and this may have been strengthened by pope s remark that he  - translated don quixote  without understanding spanish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has been also charged with borrowing from shelton , whom he disparaged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true that in a few difficult or obscure passages he has followed shelton , and gone astray with him; but for one case of this sort , there are fifty where he is right and shelton wrong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for pope s dictum , anyone who examines jervas s version carefully , side by side with the original , will see that he was a sound spanish scholar , incomparably a better one than shelton , except perhaps in mere colloquial spanish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was , in fact , an honest , faithful , and painstaking translator , and he has left a version which , whatever its shortcomings may be , is singularly free from errors and mistranslations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it may be pleaded for jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrence of the light , flippant , jocose style of his predecessors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was one of the few , very few , translators that have shown any apprehension of the unsmiling gravity which is the essence of quixotic humour; it seemed to him a crime to bring cervantes forward smirking and grinning at his own good things , and to this may be attributed in a great measure the ascetic abstinence from everything savouring of liveliness which is the characteristic of his translation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in most modern editions , it should be observed , his style has been smoothed and smartened , but without any reference to the original spanish , so that if he has been made to read more agreeably he has also been robbed of his chief merit of fidelity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> smollett s version , published in 1755 , may be almost counted as one of these . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the foregoing history of our translations of  - don quixote , it will be seen that there are a good many people who , provided they get the mere narrative with its full complement of facts , incidents , and adventures served up to them in a form that amuses them , care very little whether that form is the one in which cervantes originally shaped his ideas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the other hand , it is clear that there are many who desire to have not merely the story he tells , but the story as he tells it , so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstances permit , and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator , even though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes; there is no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other , or why a translator who makes it his aim to treat  - don quixote with the respect due to a great classic , should not be as acceptable even to the careless reader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest - book . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not a question of caviare to the general , or , if it is , the fault rests with him who makes so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the method by which cervantes won the ear of the spanish people ought , mutatis mutandis , to be equally effective with the great majority of english readers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he can please all parties , so much the better; but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a representation of his author as it is in his power to give them , faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is practicable , faithful to the spirit so far as he can make it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for this reason , i think , any temptation to use antiquated or obsolete language should be resisted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> except in the tales and don quixote s speeches , the translator who uses the simplest and plainest everyday language will almost always be the one who approaches nearest to the original . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing that the story of  - don quixote and all its characters and incidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar as household words in english mouths , it seems to me that the old familiar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ii: about cervantes and don quixote<s> <s> four generations had laughed over  - don quixote before it occurred to anyone to ask , who and what manner of man was this miguel de cervantes saavedra whose name is on the title - page; and it was too late for a satisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life of the author to the london edition published at lord carteret s instance in 1738 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all traces of the personality of cervantes had by that time disappeared . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that mayans y siscar , to whom the task was entrusted , or any of those who followed him , rios , pellicer , or navarrete , could do was to eke out the few allusions cervantes makes to himself in his various prefaces with such pieces of documentary evidence bearing upon his life as they could find . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , however , has been done by the last - named biographer to such good purpose that he has superseded all predecessors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thoroughness is the chief characteristic of navarrete s work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> navarrete has done all that industry and acumen could do , and it is no fault of his if he has not given us what we want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by a contemporary has been produced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is only natural , therefore , that the biographers of cervantes , forced to make brick without straw , should have recourse largely to conjecture , and that conjecture should in some instances come by degrees to take the place of established fact . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that i propose to do here is to separate what is matter of fact from what is matter of conjecture , and leave it to the reader s judgment to decide whether the data justify the inference or not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the family of cervantes is commonly said to have been of galician origin , and unquestionably it was in possession of lands in galicia at a very early date; but i think the balance of the evidence tends to show that the  - solar , the original site of the family , was at cervatos in the north - west corner of old castile , close to the junction of castile , leon , and the asturias . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the origin of the name cervantes is curious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nuno alfonso was almost as distinguished in the struggle against the moors in the reign of alfonso vii as the cid had been half a century before in that of alfonso vi , and was rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood of toledo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on one of his acquisitions , about two leagues from the city , he built himself a castle which he called cervatos , because  - he was lord of the solar of cervatos in the montana , as the mountain region extending from the basque provinces to leon was always called . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at his death in battle in 1143 , the castle passed by his will to his son alfonso munio , who , as territorial or local surnames were then coming into vogue in place of the simple patronymic , took the additional name of cervatos . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was built , or as some say restored , by alfonso vi shortly after his occupation of toledo in 1085 , and called by him san servando after a spanish martyr , a name subsequently modified into san servan ( in which form it appears in the  - poem of the cid ) , san servantes , and san cervantes: with regard to which last the  - handbook for spain warns its readers against the supposition that it has anything to do with the author of  - don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ford , as all know who have taken him for a companion and counsellor on the roads of spain , is seldom wrong in matters of literature or history . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this instance , however , he is in error . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gonzalo , above mentioned , it may be readily conceived , did not relish the appropriation by his brother of a name to which he himself had an equal right , for though nominally taken from the castle , it was in reality derived from the ancient territorial possession of the family , and as a set - off , and to distinguish himself ( diferenciarse ) from his brother , he took as a surname the name of the castle on the bank of the tagus , in the building of which , according to a family tradition , his great - grandfather had a share . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> both brothers founded families . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the cervantes branch had more tenacity; it sent offshoots in various directions , andalusia , estremadura , galicia , and portugal , and produced a goodly line of men distinguished in the service of church and state . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of the line that settled in andalusia , deigo de cervantes , commander of the order of santiago , married juana avellaneda , daughter of juan arias de saavedra , and had several sons , of whom one was gonzalo gomez , corregidor of jerez and ancestor of the mexican and columbian branches of the family; and another , juan , whose son rodrigo married dona leonor de cortinas , and by her had four children , rodrigo , andrea , luisa , and miguel , our author . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a man who could look back upon an ancestry of genuine knights - errant extending from well - nigh the time of pelayo to the siege of granada was likely to have a strong feeling on the subject of the sham chivalry of the romances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it gives a point , too , to what he says in more than one place about families that have once been great and have tapered away until they have come to nothing , like a pyramid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the case of his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was born at alcala de henares and baptised in the church of santa maria mayor on the 9th of october , 1547 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of his boyhood and youth we know nothing , unless it be from the glimpse he gives us in the preface to his  - comedies of himself as a boy looking on with delight while lope de rueda and his company set up their rude plank stage in the plaza and acted the rustic farces which he himself afterwards took as the model of his interludes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this first glimpse , however , is a significant one , for it shows the early development of that love of the drama which exercised such an influence on his life and seems to have grown stronger as he grew older , and of which this very preface , written only a few months before his death , is such a striking proof . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he gives us to understand , too , that he was a great reader in his youth; but of this no assurance was needed , for the first part of  - don quixote alone proves a vast amount of miscellaneous reading , romances of chivalry , ballads , popular poetry , chronicles , for which he had no time or opportunity except in the first twenty years of his life; and his misquotations and mistakes in matters of detail are always , it may be noticed , those of a man recalling the reading of his boyhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the period of his boyhood was in every way a transition period for spain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old chivalrous spain had passed away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the policy of ferdinand and ximenez the sovereign had been made absolute , and the church and inquisition adroitly adjusted to keep him so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the nobles , who had always resisted absolutism as strenuously as they had fought the moors , had been divested of all political power , a like fate had befallen the cities , the free constitutions of castile and aragon had been swept away , and the only function that remained to the cortes was that of granting money at the king s dictation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the transition extended to literature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men who , like garcilaso de la vega and diego hurtado de mendoza , followed the italian wars , had brought back from italy the products of the post - renaissance literature , which took root and flourished and even threatened to extinguish the native growths . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> damon and thyrsis , phyllis and chloe had been fairly naturalised in spain , together with all the devices of pastoral poetry for investing with an air of novelty the idea of a dispairing shepherd and inflexible shepherdess . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as a set - off against this , the old historical and traditional ballads , and the true pastorals , the songs and ballads of peasant life , were being collected assiduously and printed in the cancioneros that succeeded one another with increasing rapidity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the most notable consequence , perhaps , of the spread of printing was the flood of romances of chivalry that had continued to pour from the press ever since garci ordonez de montalvo had resuscitated  - amadis of gaul at the beginning of the century . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a youth fond of reading , solid or light , there could have been no better spot in spain than alcala de henares in the middle of the sixteenth century . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was then a busy , populous university town , something more than the enterprising rival of salamanca , and altogether a very different place from the melancholy , silent , deserted alcala the traveller sees now as he goes from madrid to saragossa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> theology and medicine may have been the strong points of the university , but the town itself seems to have inclined rather to the humanities and light literature , and as a producer of books alcala was already beginning to compete with the older presses of toledo , burgos , salamanca and seville . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a pendant to the picture cervantes has given us of his first playgoings might , no doubt , have been often seen in the streets of alcala at that time; a bright , eager , tawny - haired boy peering into a book - shop where the latest volumes lay open to tempt the public , wondering , it may be , what that little book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and his boy , that called itself  - vida de lazarillo de tormes , segunda impresion , could be about; or with eyes brimming over with merriment gazing at one of those preposterous portraits of a knight - errant in outrageous panoply and plumes with which the publishers of chivalry romances loved to embellish the title - pages of their folios . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if the boy was the father of the man , the sense of the incongruous that was strong at fifty was lively at ten , and some such reflections as these may have been the true genesis of  - don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for his more solid education , we are told , he went to salamanca . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the only evidence is a vague statement by professor tomas gonzalez , that he once saw an old entry of the matriculation of a miguel de cervantes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that he was a student neither at salamanca nor at alcala is best proved by his own works . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no man drew more largely upon experience than he did , and he has nowhere left a single reminiscence of student lifefor the  - tia fingida , if it be his , is not onenothing , not even  - a college joke , to show that he remembered days that most men remember best . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that we know positively about his education is that juan lopez de hoyos , a professor of humanities and belles - lettres of some eminence , calls him his  - dear and beloved pupil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was in a little collection of verses by different hands on the death of isabel de valois , second queen of philip ii , published by the professor in 1569 , to which cervantes contributed four pieces , including an elegy , and an epitaph in the form of a sonnet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is only by a rare chance that a  - lycidas finds its way into a volume of this sort , and cervantes was no milton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giulio , afterwards cardinal , acquaviva had been sent at the end of 1568 to philip ii by the pope on a mission , partly of condolence , partly political , and on his return to rome , which was somewhat brusquely expedited by the king , he took cervantes with him as his camarero ( chamberlain ) , the office he himself held in the pope s household . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what impelled him to this step we know not , whether it was distaste for the career before him , or purely military enthusiasm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it may well have been the latter , for it was a stirring time; the events , however , which led to the alliance between spain , venice , and the pope , against the common enemy , the porte , and to the victory of the combined fleets at lepanto , belong rather to the history of europe than to the life of cervantes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the news that the enemy was in sight he rose , and , in spite of the remonstrances of his comrades and superiors , insisted on taking his post , saying he preferred death in the service of god and the king to health . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his galley , the marquesa , was in the thick of the fight , and before it was over he had received three gunshot wounds , two in the breast and one in the left hand or arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the morning after the battle , according to navarrete , he had an interview with the commander - in - chief , don john , who was making a personal inspection of the wounded , one result of which was an addition of three crowns to his pay , and another , apparently , the friendship of his general . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he came out with his left hand permanently disabled; he had lost the use of it , as mercury told him in the  - viaje del parnaso for the greater glory of the right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , however , did not absolutely unfit him for service , and in april 1572 he joined manuel ponce de leon s company of lope de figueroa s regiment , in which , it seems probable , his brother rodrigo was serving , and shared in the operations of the next three years , including the capture of the goletta and tunis . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> taking advantage of the lull which followed the recapture of these places by the turks , he obtained leave to return to spain , and sailed from naples in september 1575 on board the sun galley , in company with his brother rodrigo , pedro carrillo de quesada , late governor of the goletta , and some others , and furnished with letters from don john of austria and the duke of sesa , the viceroy of sicily , recommending him to the king for the command of a company , on account of his services; a dono infelice as events proved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the 26th they fell in with a squadron of algerine galleys , and after a stout resistance were overpowered and carried into algiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by means of a ransomed fellow - captive the brothers contrived to inform their family of their condition , and the poor people at alcala at once strove to raise the ransom money , the father disposing of all he possessed , and the two sisters giving up their marriage portions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the owner of rodrigo , however , was more easily satisfied; ransom was accepted in his case , and it was arranged between the brothers that he should return to spain and procure a vessel in which he was to come back to algiers and take off miguel and as many of their comrades as possible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a garden outside the city on the sea - shore , he constructed , with the help of the gardener , a spaniard , a hiding - place , to which he brought , one by one , fourteen of his fellow - captives , keeping them there in secrecy for several months , and supplying them with food through a renegade known as el dorador ,  - the gilder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how he , a captive himself , contrived to do all this , is one of the mysteries of the story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the vessel procured by rodrigo made its appearance off the coast , and under cover of night was proceeding to take off the refugees , when the crew were alarmed by a passing fishing boat , and beat a hasty retreat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on renewing the attempt shortly afterwards , they , or a portion of them at least , were taken prisoners , and just as the poor fellows in the garden were exulting in the thought that in a few moments more freedom would be within their grasp , they found themselves surrounded by turkish troops , horse and foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dorador had revealed the whole scheme to the dey hassan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when cervantes saw what had befallen them , he charged his companions to lay all the blame upon him , and as they were being bound he declared aloud that the whole plot was of his contriving , and that nobody else had any share in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> brought before the dey , he said the same . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was threatened with impalement and with torture; and as cutting off ears and noses were playful freaks with the algerines , it may be conceived what their tortures were like; but nothing could make him swerve from his original statement that he and he alone was responsible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he felt , no doubt , that a man of such resource , energy , and daring , was too dangerous a piece of property to be left in private hands; and he had him heavily ironed and lodged in his own prison . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he thought that by these means he could break the spirit or shake the resolution of his prisoner , he was soon undeceived , for cervantes contrived before long to despatch a letter to the governor of oran , entreating him to send him some one that could be trusted , to enable him and three other gentlemen , fellow - captives of his , to make their escape; intending evidently to renew his first attempt with a more trustworthy guide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this time his plan was to purchase , by the aid of a spanish renegade and two valencian merchants resident in algiers , an armed vessel in which he and about sixty of the leading captives were to make their escape; but just as they were about to put it into execution one doctor juan blanco de paz , an ecclesiastic and a compatriot , informed the dey of the plot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cervantes by force of character , by his self - devotion , by his untiring energy and his exertions to lighten the lot of his companions in misery , had endeared himself to all , and become the leading spirit in the captive colony , and , incredible as it may seem , jealousy of his influence and the esteem in which he was held , moved this man to compass his destruction by a cruel death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the merchants finding that the dey knew all , and fearing that cervantes under torture might make disclosures that would imperil their own lives , tried to persuade him to slip away on board a vessel that was on the point of sailing for spain; but he told them they had nothing to fear , for no tortures would make him compromise anybody , and he went at once and gave himself up to the dey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as before , the dey tried to force him to name his accomplices . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the dey , however , demanded more than double the sum offered , and as his term of office had expired and he was about to sail for constantinople , taking all his slaves with him , the case of cervantes was critical . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was already on board heavily ironed , when the dey at length agreed to reduce his demand by one - half , and father gil by borrowing was able to make up the amount , and on september 19 , 1580 , after a captivity of five years all but a week , cervantes was at last set free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> before long he discovered that blanco de paz , who claimed to be an officer of the inquisition , was now concocting on false evidence a charge of misconduct to be brought against him on his return to spain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to checkmate him cervantes drew up a series of twenty - five questions , covering the whole period of his captivity , upon which he requested father gil to take the depositions of credible witnesses before a notary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> eleven witnesses taken from among the principal captives in algiers deposed to all the facts above stated and to a great deal more besides . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is something touching in the admiration , love , and gratitude we see struggling to find expression in the formal language of the notary , as they testify one after another to the good deeds of cervantes , how he comforted and helped the weak - hearted , how he kept up their drooping courage , how he shared his poor purse with this deponent , and how  - in him this deponent found father and mother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on his return to spain he found his old regiment about to march for portugal to support philip s claim to the crown , and utterly penniless now , had no choice but to rejoin it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was in the expeditions to the azores in 1582 and the following year , and on the conclusion of the war returned to spain in the autumn of 1583 , bringing with him the manuscript of his pastoral romance , the  - galatea , and probably also , to judge by internal evidence , that of the first portion of  - persiles and sigismunda . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he also brought back with him , his biographers assert , an infant daughter , the offspring of an amour , as some of them with great circumstantiality inform us , with a lisbon lady of noble birth , whose name , however , as well as that of the street she lived in , they omit to mention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sole foundation for all this is that in 1605 there certainly was living in the family of cervantes a dona isabel de saavedra , who is described in an official document as his natural daughter , and then twenty years of age . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with his crippled left hand promotion in the army was hopeless , now that don john was dead and he had no one to press his claims and services , and for a man drawing on to forty life in the ranks was a dismal prospect; he had already a certain reputation as a poet; he made up his mind , therefore , to cast his lot with literature , and for a first venture committed his  - galatea to the press . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was published , as salva y mallen shows conclusively , at alcala , his own birth - place , in 1585 and no doubt helped to make his name more widely known , but certainly did not do him much good in any other way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while it was going through the press , he married dona catalina de palacios salazar y vozmediano , a lady of esquivias near madrid , and apparently a friend of the family , who brought him a fortune which may possibly have served to keep the wolf from the door , but if so , that was all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the drama had by this time outgrown market - place stages and strolling companies , and with his old love for it he naturally turned to it for a congenial employment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in about three years he wrote twenty or thirty plays , which he tells us were performed without any throwing of cucumbers or other missiles , and ran their course without any hisses , outcries , or disturbance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in other words , his plays were not bad enough to be hissed off the stage , but not good enough to hold their own upon it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> only two of them have been preserved , but as they happen to be two of the seven or eight he mentions with complacency , we may assume they are favourable specimens , and no one who reads the  - numancia and the  - trato de argel will feel any surprise that they failed as acting dramas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> whatever merits they may have , whatever occasional they may show , they are , as regards construction , incurably clumsy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when lope began to write for the stage is uncertain , but it was certainly after cervantes went to seville . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> among the  - nuevos documentos printed by seor asensio y toledo is one dated 1592 , and curiously characteristic of cervantes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was more successful in a literary contest at saragossa in 1595 in honour of the canonisation of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in order to remit the money he had collected more conveniently to the treasury , he entrusted it to a merchant , who failed and absconded; and as the bankrupt s assets were insufficient to cover the whole , he was sent to prison at seville in september 1597 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> , and on giving security for it he was released at the end of the year . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nay , it may well be that on those journeys into remote regions he came across now and then a specimen of the pauper gentleman , with his lean hack and his greyhound and his books of chivalry , dreaming away his life in happy ignorance that the world had changed since his great - grandfather s old helmet was new . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was in seville that he found out his true vocation , though he himself would not by any means have admitted it to be so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was there , in triana , that he was first tempted to try his hand at drawing from life , and first brought his humour into play in the exquisite little sketch of  - rinconete y cortadillo , the germ , in more ways than one , of  - don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> where and when that was written , we cannot tell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after his imprisonment all trace of cervantes in his official capacity disappears , from which it may be inferred that he was not reinstated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the words in the preface to the first part of  - don quixote are generally held to be conclusive that he conceived the idea of the book , and wrote the beginning of it at least , in a prison , and that he may have done so is extremely likely . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a tradition that cervantes read some portions of his work to a select audience at the duke of bejar s , which may have helped to make the book known; but the obvious conclusion is that the first part of  - don quixote lay on his hands some time before he could find a publisher bold enough to undertake a venture of so novel a character; and so little faith in it had francisco robles of madrid , to whom at last he sold it , that he did not care to incur the expense of securing the copyright for aragon or portugal , contenting himself with that for castile . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the printing was finished in december , and the book came out with the new year , 1605 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is often said that  - don quixote was at first received coldly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no sooner was it in the hands of the public than preparations were made to issue pirated editions at lisbon and valencia , and to bring out a second edition with the additional copyrights for aragon and portugal , which he secured in february . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no doubt it was received with something more than coldness by certain sections of the community . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> men of wit , taste , and discrimination among the aristocracy gave it a hearty welcome , but the aristocracy in general were not likely to relish a book that turned their favourite reading into ridicule and laughed at so many of their favourite ideas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dramatists who gathered round lope as their leader regarded cervantes as their common enemy , and it is plain that he was equally obnoxious to the other clique , the culto poets who had gongora for their chief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in 1601 valladolid was made the seat of the court , and at the beginning of 1603 cervantes had been summoned thither in connection with the balance due by him to the treasury , which was still outstanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained at valladolid , apparently supporting himself by agencies and scrivener s work of some sort; probably drafting petitions and drawing up statements of claims to be presented to the council , and the like . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , at least , we gather from the depositions taken on the occasion of the death of a gentleman , the victim of a street brawl , who had been carried into the house in which he lived . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in these he himself is described as a man who wrote and transacted business , and it appears that his household then consisted of his wife , the natural daughter isabel de saavedra already mentioned , his sister andrea , now a widow , her daughter constanza , a mysterious magdalena de sotomayor calling herself his sister , for whom his biographers cannot account , and a servant - maid . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> robles , the madrid publisher , found it necessary to meet the demand by a third edition , the seventh in all , in 1608 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the popularity of the book in italy was such that a milan bookseller was led to bring out an edition in 1610; and another was called for in brussels in 1611 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it might naturally have been expected that , with such proofs before him that he had hit the taste of the public , cervantes would have at once set about redeeming his rather vague promise of a second volume . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , to all appearance , nothing was farther from his thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had still by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he had inserted in  - don quixote and instead of continuing the adventures of don quixote , he set to work to write more of these  - novelas exemplares as he afterwards called them , with a view to making a book of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this , eight years and a half after the first part of  - don quixote had appeared , we get the first hint of a forthcoming second part . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but more than poems , or pastorals , or novels , it was his dramatic ambition that engrossed his thoughts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same indomitable spirit that kept him from despair in the bagnios of algiers , and prompted him to attempt the escape of himself and his comrades again and again , made him persevere in spite of failure and discouragement in his efforts to win the ear of the public as a dramatist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the temperament of cervantes was essentially sanguine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the portrait he draws in the preface to the novels , with the aquiline features , chestnut hair , smooth untroubled forehead , and bright cheerful eyes , is the very portrait of a sanguine man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing that the managers might say could persuade him that the merits of his plays would not be recognised at last if they were only given a fair chance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was , indeed , as he says himself in his preface , more a stepfather than a father to  - don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never was great work so neglected by its author . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he appears to have regarded the book as little more than a mere libro de entretenimiento , an amusing book , a thing , as he says in the  - viaje ,  - to divert the melancholy moody heart at any time or season . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no doubt he had an affection for his hero , and was very proud of sancho panza . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it was not the success he coveted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nemesis was coming , however . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had got as far as chapter lix , which at his leisurely pace he could hardly have reached before october or november 1614 , when there was put into his hand a small octave lately printed at tarragona , and calling itself  - second volume of the ingenious gentleman don quixote of la mancha: by the licentiate alonso fernandez de avellaneda of tordesillas . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the last half of chapter lix and most of the following chapters of the second part give us some idea of the effect produced upon him , and his irritation was not likely to be lessened by the reflection that he had no one to blame but himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had avellaneda , in fact , been content with merely bringing out a continuation to  - don quixote , cervantes would have had no reasonable grievance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact cervantes had no case , or a very bad one , as far as the mere continuation was concerned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but avellaneda chose to write a preface to it , full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill - conditioned man could pour out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he taunts cervantes with being old , with having lost his hand , with having been in prison , with being poor , with being friendless , accuses him of envy of lope s success , of petulance and querulousness , and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> avellaneda s reason for this personal attack is obvious enough . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his identification has exercised the best critics and baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear on it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> navarrete and ticknor both incline to the belief that cervantes knew who he was; but i must say i think the anger he shows suggests an invisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito in the dark . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cervantes from certain solecisms of language pronounces him to be an aragonese , and pellicer , an aragonese himself , supports this view and believes him , moreover , to have been an ecclesiastic , a dominican probably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> any merit avellaneda has is reflected from cervantes , and he is too dull to reflect much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is , at best , a poor plagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead given him by cervantes; his only humour lies in making don quixote take inns for castles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage , and sancho mistake words , invert proverbs , and display his gluttony; all through he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt , and he has contrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by the sixteenth century novellieri and without their sprightliness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but whatever avellaneda and his book may be , we must not forget the debt we owe them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but for them , there can be no doubt ,  - don quixote would have come to us a mere torso instead of a complete work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even if cervantes had finished the volume he had in hand , most assuredly he would have left off with a promise of a third part , giving the further adventures of don quixote and humours of sancho panza as shepherds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is plain that he had at one time an intention of dealing with the pastoral romances as he had dealt with the books of chivalry , and but for avellaneda he would have tried to carry it out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is needless to say they were put forward by cervantes in all good faith and full confidence in their merits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the reader , however , was not to suppose they were his last word or final effort in the drama , for he had in hand a comedy called  - engano a los ojos , about which , if he mistook not , there would be no question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of this dramatic masterpiece the world has no opportunity of judging; his health had been failing for some time , and he died , apparently of dropsy , on the 23rd of april , 1616 , the day on which england lost shakespeare , nominally at least , for the english calendar had not yet been reformed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he died as he had lived , accepting his lot bravely and cheerfully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it an unhappy life , that of cervantes? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his biographers all tell us that it was; but i must say i doubt it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a hard life , a life of poverty , of incessant struggle , of toil ill paid , of disappointment , but cervantes carried within himself the antidote to all these evils . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his was not one of those light natures that rise above adversity merely by virtue of their own buoyancy; it was in the fortitude of a high spirit that he was proof against it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> add to all this his vital energy and mental activity , his restless invention and his sanguine temperament , and there will be reason enough to doubt whether his could have been a very unhappy life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he who could take cervantes  distresses together with his apparatus for enduring them would not make so bad a bargain , perhaps , as far as happiness in life is concerned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of his burial - place nothing is known except that he was buried , in accordance with his will , in the neighbouring convent of trinitarian nuns , of which it is supposed his daughter , isabel de saavedra , was an inmate , and that a few years afterwards the nuns removed to another convent , carrying their dead with them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in some of the others there is a good deal of exaggeration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to listen to most of his biographers one would suppose that all spain was in league not only against the man but against his memory , or at least that it was insensible to his merits , and left him to live in misery and die of want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to talk of his hard life and unworthy employments in andalusia is absurd . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the scramble for copies which , as we have seen , followed immediately on the appearance of the book , does not look like general insensibility to its merits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no doubt it was received coldly by some , but if a man writes a book in ridicule of periwigs he must make his account with being coldly received by the periwig wearers and hated by the whole tribe of wigmakers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it did the best it could; it read his book and liked it and bought it , and encouraged the bookseller to pay him well for others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what need has cervantes of  - such weak witness of his name; or what could a monument do in his case except testify to the self - glorification of those who had put it up? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nine editions of the first part of  - don quixote had already appeared before cervantes died , thirty thousand copies in all , according to his own estimate , and a tenth was printed at barcelona the year after his death . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so large a number naturally supplied the demand for some time , but by 1634 it appears to have been exhausted; and from that time down to the present day the stream of editions has continued to flow rapidly and regularly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> except the bible , in fact , no book has been so widely diffused as  - don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the  - imitatio christi may have been translated into as many different languages , and perhaps  - robinson crusoe and the  - vicar of wakefield into nearly as many , but in multiplicity of translations and editions  - don quixote leaves them all far behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still more remarkable is the character of this wide diffusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - don quixote has been thoroughly naturalised among people whose ideas about knight - errantry , if they had any at all , were of the vaguest , who had never seen or heard of a book of chivalry , who could not possibly feel the humour of the burlesque or sympathise with the author s purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another curious fact is that this , the most cosmopolitan book in the world , is one of the most intensely national . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is something in it for every sort of reader , young or old , sage or simple , high or low . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as cervantes himself says with a touch of pride ,  - it is thumbed and read and got by heart by people of all sorts; the children turn its leaves , the young people read it , the grown men understand it , the old folk praise it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it would be idle to deny that the ingredient which , more than its humour , or its wisdom , or the fertility of invention or knowledge of human nature it displays , has insured its success with the multitude , is the vein of farce that runs through it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the attack upon the sheep , the battle with the wine - skins , mambrino s helmet , the balsam of fierabras , don quixote knocked over by the sails of the windmill , sancho tossed in the blanket , the mishaps and misadventures of master and man , that were originally the great attraction , and perhaps are so still to some extent with the majority of readers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is plain that  - don quixote was generally regarded at first , and indeed in spain for a long time , as little more than a queer droll book , full of laughable incidents and absurd situations , very amusing , but not entitled to much consideration or care . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the editions printed in spain from 1637 to 1771 , when the famous printer ibarra took it up , were mere trade editions , badly and carelessly printed on vile paper and got up in the style of chap - books intended only for popular use , with , in most instances , uncouth illustrations and clap - trap additions by the publisher . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to england belongs the credit of having been the first country to recognise the right of  - don quixote to better treatment than this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the zeal of publishers , editors , and annotators brought about a remarkable change of sentiment with regard to  - don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the humour was not entirely denied , but , according to the new view , it was rated as an altogether secondary quality , a mere accessory , nothing more than the stalking - horse under the presentation of which cervantes shot his philosophy or his satire , or whatever it was he meant to shoot; for on this point opinions varied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all were agreed , however , that the object he aimed at was not the books of chivalry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said emphatically in the preface to the first part and in the last sentence of the second , that he had no other object in view than to discredit these books , and this , to advanced criticism , made it clear that his object must have been something else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> something of the antagonism , no doubt , is to be found in  - don quixote , because it is to be found everywhere in life , and cervantes drew from life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is difficult to imagine a community in which the never - ceasing game of cross - purposes between sancho panza and don quixote would not be recognized as true to nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the stone age , among the lake dwellers , among the cave men , there were don quixotes and sancho panzas; there must have been the troglodyte who never could see the facts before his eyes , and the troglodyte who could see nothing else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to suppose cervantes deliberately setting himself to expound any such idea in two stout quarto volumes is to suppose something not only very unlike the age in which he lived , but altogether unlike cervantes himself , who would have been the first to laugh at an attempt of the sort made by anyone else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day is quite enough to account for the genesis of the book . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some idea of the prodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenth century may be obtained from the scrutiny of chapter vii , if the reader bears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far the largest group are enumerated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as to its effect upon the nation , there is abundant evidence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from the time when the amadises and palmerins began to grow popular down to the very end of the century , there is a steady stream of invective , from men whose character and position lend weight to their words , against the romances of chivalry and the infatuation of their readers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that this was the task cervantes set himself , and that he had ample provocation to urge him to it , will be sufficiently clear to those who look into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalry itself that he attacked and swept away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of all the absurdities that , thanks to poetry , will be repeated to the end of time , there is no greater one than saying that  - cervantes smiled spain s chivalry away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the true nature of the  - right arm and the  - bright array , before which , according to the poet ,  - the world gave ground , and which cervantes  single laugh demolished , may be gathered from the words of one of his own countrymen , don felix pacheco , as reported by captain george carleton , in his  - military memoirs from 1672 to 1713 . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - before the appearance in the world of that labour of cervantes , he said ,  - it was next to an impossibility for a man to walk the streets with any delight or without danger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and i verily believe that to this , and this only , we owe that dampness and poverty of spirit which has run through all our councils for a century past , so little agreeable to those nobler actions of our famous ancestors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would be so if its moral were that , in this world , true enthusiasm naturally leads to ridicule and discomfiture . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but it preaches nothing of the sort; its moral , so far as it can be said to have one , is that the spurious enthusiasm that is born of vanity and self - conceit , that is made an end in itself , not a means to an end , that acts on mere impulse , regardless of circumstances and consequences , is mischievous to its owner , and a very considerable nuisance to the community at large . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to those who cannot distinguish between the one kind and the other , no doubt  - don quixote is a sad book; no doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who had just uttered so beautiful a sentiment as that  - it is a hard case to make slaves of those whom god and nature made free , should be ungratefully pelted by the scoundrels his crazy philanthropy had let loose on society; but to others of a more judicial cast it will be a matter of regret that reckless self - sufficient enthusiasm is not oftener requited in some such way for all the mischief it does in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a very slight examination of the structure of  - don quixote will suffice to show that cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan in his mind when he began the book . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when he wrote those lines in which  - with a few strokes of a great master he sets before us the pauper gentleman , he had no idea of the goal to which his imagination was leading him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there can be little doubt that all he contemplated was a short tale to range with those he had already written , a tale setting forth the ludicrous results that might be expected to follow the attempt of a crazy gentleman to act the part of a knight - errant in modern life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is plain , for one thing , that sancho panza did not enter into the original scheme , for had cervantes thought of him he certainly would not have omitted him in his hero s outfit , which he obviously meant to be complete . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> him we owe to the landlord s chance remark in chapter iii that knights seldom travelled without squires . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to try to think of a don quixote without sancho panza is like trying to think of a one - bladed pair of scissors . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the story was written at first , like the others , without any division and without the intervention of cid hamete benengeli; and it seems not unlikely that cervantes had some intention of bringing dulcinea , or aldonza lorenzo , on the scene in person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was probably the ransacking of the don s library and the discussion on the books of chivalry that first suggested it to him that his idea was capable of development . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what , if instead of a mere string of farcical misadventures , he were to make his tale a burlesque of one of these books , caricaturing their style , incidents , and spirit? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in pursuance of this change of plan , he hastily and somewhat clumsily divided what he had written into chapters on the model of  - amadis , invented the fable of a mysterious arabic manuscript , and set up cid hamete benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of the chivalry - romance authors , who were fond of tracing their books to some recondite source . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in working out the new ideas , he soon found the value of sancho panza . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , the keynote , not only to sancho s part , but to the whole book , is struck in the first words sancho utters when he announces his intention of taking his ass with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - about the ass , we are told ,  - don quixote hesitated a little , trying whether he could call to mind any knight - errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass - back; but no instance occurred to his memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we can see the whole scene at a glance , the stolid unconsciousness of sancho and the perplexity of his master , upon whose perception the incongruity has just forced itself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is sancho s mission throughout the book; he is an unconscious mephistopheles , always unwittingly making mockery of his master s aspirations , always exposing the fallacy of his ideas by some unintentional ad absurdum , always bringing him back to the world of fact and commonplace by force of sheer stolidity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the time cervantes had got his volume of novels off his hands , and summoned up resolution enough to set about the second part in earnest , the case was very much altered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote and sancho panza had not merely found favour , but had already become , what they have never since ceased to be , veritable entities to the popular imagination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was no occasion for him now to interpolate extraneous matter; nay , his readers told him plainly that what they wanted of him was more don quixote and more sancho panza , and not novels , tales , or digressions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to himself , too , his creations had become realities , and he had become proud of them , especially of sancho . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he began the second part , therefore , under very different conditions , and the difference makes itself manifest at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote and sancho undergo a change also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first part , don quixote has no character or individuality whatever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is nothing more than a crazy representative of the sentiments of the chivalry romances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the business of a knight - errant to right wrongs , redress injuries , and succour the distressed , and this , as a matter of course , he makes his business when he takes up the part; a knight - errant was bound to be intrepid , and so he feels bound to cast fear aside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of all byron s melodious nonsense about don quixote , the most nonsensical statement is that  - t is his virtue makes him mad! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the exact opposite is the truth; it is his madness makes him virtuous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the advantage of this is that he is enabled to make use of don quixote as a mouthpiece for his own reflections , and so , without seeming to digress , allow himself the relief of digression when he requires it , as freely as in a commonplace book . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon don quixote is not very great . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are some natural touches of character about him , such as his mixture of irascibility and placability , and his curious affection for sancho together with his impatience of the squire s loquacity and impertinence; but in the main , apart from his craze , he is little more than a thoughtful , cultured gentleman , with instinctive good taste and a great deal of shrewdness and originality of mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho , when he reappears , is the old sancho with the old familiar features; but with a difference; they have been brought out more distinctly , but at the same time with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature; the outline has been filled in where filling in was necessary , and , vivified by a few touches of a master s hand , sancho stands before us as he might in a character portrait by velazquez . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is a much more important and prominent figure in the second part than in the first; indeed , it is his matchless mendacity about dulcinea that to a great extent supplies the action of the story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first part he displays a great natural gift of lying . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his lies are not of the highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly indulge in; like falstaff s , they resemble the father that begets them; they are simple , homely , plump lies; plain working lies , in short . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in the service of such a master as don quixote he develops rapidly , as we see when he comes to palm off the three country wenches as dulcinea and her ladies in waiting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is worth noticing how , flushed by his success in this instance , he is tempted afterwards to try a flight beyond his powers in his account of the journey on clavileno . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> enchantments of the sort travestied in those of dulcinea and the trifaldi and the cave of montesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances , and another distinguishing feature is caricatured in don quixote s blind adoration of dulcinea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the romances of chivalry love is either a mere animalism or a fantastic idolatry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like everything else in these romances , it is a gross exaggeration of the real sentiment of chivalry , but its peculiar extravagance is probably due to the influence of those masters of hyperbole , the provencal poets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when a troubadour professed his readiness to obey his lady in all things , he made it incumbent upon the next comer , if he wished to avoid the imputation of tameness and commonplace , to declare himself the slave of her will , which the next was compelled to cap by some still stronger declaration; and so expressions of devotion went on rising one above the other like biddings at an auction , and a conventional language of gallantry and theory of love came into being that in time permeated the literature of southern europe , and bore fruit , in one direction in the transcendental worship of beatrice and laura , and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found exponents in writers like feliciano de silva . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the great merits of  - don quixote , and one of the qualities that have secured its acceptance by all classes of readers and made it the most cosmopolitan of books , is its simplicity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are , of course , points obvious enough to a spanish seventeenth century audience which do not immediately strike a reader now - a - days , and cervantes often takes it for granted that an allusion will be generally understood which is only intelligible to a few . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for example , on many of his readers in spain , and most of his readers out of it , the significance of his choice of a country for his hero is completely lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it would be going too far to say that no one can thoroughly comprehend  - don quixote without having seen la mancha , but undoubtedly even a glimpse of la mancha will give an insight into the meaning of cervantes such as no commentator can give . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of all the regions of spain it is the last that would suggest the idea of romance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is something impressive about the grim solitudes of estremadura; and if the plains of leon and old castile are bald and dreary , they are studded with old cities renowned in history and rich in relics of the past . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but there is no redeeming feature in the manchegan landscape; it has all the sameness of the desert without its dignity; the few towns and villages that break its monotony are mean and commonplace , there is nothing venerable about them , they have not even the picturesqueness of poverty; indeed , don quixote s own village , argamasilla , has a sort of oppressive respectability in the prim regularity of its streets and houses; everything is ignoble; the very windmills are the ugliest and shabbiest of the windmill kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to anyone who knew the country well , the mere style and title of  - don quixote of la mancha gave the key to the author s meaning at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is strange that this element of incongruity , underlying the whole humour and purpose of the book , should have been so little heeded by the majority of those who have undertaken to interpret  - don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it has been completely overlooked , for example , by the illustrators . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to them a venta conveyed no idea but the abstract one of a roadside inn , and they could not therefore do full justice to the humour of don quixote s misconception in taking it for a castle , or perceive the remoteness of all its realities from his ideal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but even when better informed they seem to have no apprehension of the full force of the discrepancy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take , for instance , gustave dore s drawing of don quixote watching his armour in the inn - yard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gustave dore makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero ever watered his mules at in the corral of any venta in spain , and thereby entirely misses the point aimed at by cervantes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is the mean , prosaic , commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to don quixote s vigil and the ceremony that follows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is the incongruity of sancho in all his ways , words , and works , with the ideas and aims of his master , quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth to nature of the character , that makes him the most humorous creation in the whole range of fiction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nothing , unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of phillips , could be more out of place in an attempt to represent cervantes , than a flippant , would - be facetious style , like that of motteux s version for example , or the sprightly , jaunty air , french translators sometimes adopt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his , in fact , is the exact opposite of the humour of sterne and the self - conscious humourists . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cervantes always leaves you alone with don quixote and sancho . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he and swift and the great humourists always keep themselves out of sight , or , more properly speaking , never think about themselves at all , unlike our latter - day school of humourists , who seem to have revived the old horse - collar method , and try to raise a laugh by some grotesque assumption of ignorance , imbecility , or bad taste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true that to do full justice to spanish humour in any other language is well - nigh an impossibility . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there is a natural gravity and a sonorous stateliness about spanish , be it ever so colloquial , that make an absurdity doubly absurd , and give plausibility to the most preposterous statement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this is what makes sancho panza s drollery the despair of the conscientious translator . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> indeed , were it not for the spanish peasant s relish of  - don quixote , one might be tempted to think that the great humourist was not looked upon as a humourist at all in his own country . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the craze of don quixote seems , in some instances , to have communicated itself to his critics , making them see things that are not in the book and run full tilt at phantoms that have no existence save in their own imaginations . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like a good many critics now - a - days , they forget that screams are not criticism , and that it is only vulgar tastes that are influenced by strings of superlatives , three - piled hyperboles , and pompous epithets . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what strikes one as particularly strange is that while they deal in extravagant eulogies , and ascribe all manner of imaginary ideas and qualities to cervantes , they show no perception of the quality that ninety - nine out of a hundred of his readers would rate highest in him , and hold to be the one that raises him above all rivalry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to speak of  - don quixote as if it were merely a humorous book would be a manifest misdescription . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> among modern novels there may be , here and there , more elaborate studies of character , but there is no book richer in individualised character . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what coleridge said of shakespeare in minimis is true of cervantes; he never , even for the most temporary purpose , puts forward a lay figure . </s> </s>

<s> <s> so then , his armour being furbished , his morion turned into a helmet , his hack christened , and he himself confirmed , he came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love with; for a knight - errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit , or a body without a soul . </s> </s>

<s> <s> so , without giving notice of his intention to anyone , and without anybody seeing him , one morning before the dawning of the day ( which was one of the hottest of the month of july ) he donned his suit of armour , mounted rocinante with his patched - up helmet on , braced his buckler , took his lance , and by the back door of the yard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment and satisfaction at seeing with what ease he had made a beginning with his grand purpose . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but scarcely did he find himself upon the open plain , when a terrible thought struck him , one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at the very outset . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a knight , and that according to the law of chivalry he neither could nor ought to bear arms against any knight; and that even if he had been , still he ought , as a novice knight , to wear white armour , without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he had earned one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these reflections made him waver in his purpose , but his craze being stronger than any reasoning , he made up his mind to have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came across , following the example of others in the same case , as he had read in the books that brought him to this pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for white armour , he resolved , on the first opportunity , to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; and so comforting himself he pursued his way , taking that which his horse chose , for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus setting out , our new - fledged adventurer paced along , talking to himself and saying ,  - who knows but that in time to come , when the veracious history of my famous deeds is made known , the sage who writes it , when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning , will do it after this fashion? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - happy the age , happy the time , he continued ,  - in which shall be made known my deeds of fame , worthy to be moulded in brass , carved in marble , limned in pictures , for a memorial for ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and thou , o sage magician , whoever thou art , to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this wondrous history , forget not , i entreat thee , my good rocinante , the constant companion of my ways and wanderings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently he broke out again , as if he were love - stricken in earnest ,  - o princess dulcinea , lady of this captive heart , a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me forth with scorn , and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the presence of thy beauty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nearly all day he travelled without anything remarkable happening to him , at which he was in despair , for he was anxious to encounter some one at once upon whom to try the might of his strong arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the door were standing two young women , girls of the district as they call them , on their way to seville with some carriers who had chanced to halt that night at the inn; and as , happen what might to our adventurer , everything he saw or imaged seemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of , the moment he saw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its four turrets and pinnacles of shining silver , not forgetting the drawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of the sort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this inn , which to him seemed a castle , he advanced , and at a short distance from it he checked rocinante , hoping that some dwarf would show himself upon the battlements , and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knight was approaching the castle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but seeing that they were slow about it , and that rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable , he made for the inn door , and perceived the two gay damsels who were standing there , and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or lovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the stubbles collecting a drove of pigs ( for , without any apology , that is what they are called ) gave a blast of his horn to bring them together , and forthwith it seemed to don quixote to be what he was expecting , the signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with prodigious satisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies , who , seeing a man of this sort approaching in full armour and with lance and buckler , were turning in dismay into the inn , when don quixote , guessing their fear by their flight , raising his pasteboard visor , disclosed his dry dusty visage , and with courteous bearing and gentle voice addressed them ,  - your ladyships need not fly or fear any rudeness , for that it belongs not to the order of knighthood which i profess to offer to anyone , much less to highborn maidens as your appearance proclaims you to be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girls were looking at him and straining their eyes to make out the features which the clumsy visor obscured , but when they heard themselves called maidens , a thing so much out of their line , they could not restrain their laughter , which made don quixote wax indignant , and say ,  - modesty becomes the fair , and moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness; this , however , i say not to pain or anger you , for my desire is none other than to serve you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he , seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more than his saddle , bridle , lance , buckler , or corselet , was not at all indisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; but , in truth , standing in awe of such a complicated armament , he thought it best to speak him fairly , so he said ,  - seor caballero , if your worship wants lodging , bating the bed ( for there is not one in the inn ) there is plenty of everything else here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote , observing the respectful bearing of the alcaide of the fortress ( for so innkeeper and inn seemed in his eyes ) , made answer ,  - sir castellan , for me anything will suffice , for<s> <s> the host fancied he called him castellan because he took him for a  - worthy of castile , though he was in fact an andalusian , and one from the strand of san lucar , as crafty a thief as cacus and as full of tricks as a student or a page . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in that case , said he ,<s> <s> and if so , you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of sleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth , not to say for a single night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , he advanced to hold the stirrup for don quixote , who got down with great difficulty and exertion ( for he had not broken his fast all day ) , and then charged the host to take great care of his horse , as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlord eyed him over but did not find him as good as don quixote said , nor even half as good; and putting him up in the stable , he returned to see what might be wanted by his guest , whom the damsels , who had by this time made their peace with him , were now relieving of his armour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they had taken off his breastplate and backpiece , but they neither knew nor saw how to open his gorget or remove his make - shift helmet , for he had fastened it with green ribbons , which , as there was no untying the knots , required to be cut . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , however , he would not by any means consent to , so he remained all the evening with his helmet on , the drollest and oddest figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his armour , taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging to the castle , he said to them with great sprightliness: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a time , however , will come for your ladyships to command and me to obey , and then the might of my arm will show my desire to serve you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the girls , who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort , had nothing to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would gladly eat a bit of something , said don quixote ,  - for i feel it would come very seasonably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the day happened to be a friday , and in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they call in castile  - abadejo , in andalusia  - bacallao , and in some places  - curadillo , and in others  - troutlet; so they asked him if he thought he could eat troutlet , for there was no other fish to give him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if there be troutlets enough , said don quixote ,  - they will be the same thing as a trout; for it is all one to me whether i am given eight reals in small change or a piece of eight; moreover , it may be that these troutlets are like veal , which is better than beef , or kid , which is better than goat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but whatever it be let it come quickly , for the burden and pressure of arms cannot be borne without support to the inside . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they laid a table for him at the door of the inn for the sake of the air , and the host brought him a portion of ill - soaked and worse cooked stockfish , and a piece of bread as black and mouldy as his own armour; but a laughable sight it was to see him eating , for having his helmet on and the beaver up , he could not with his own hands put anything into his mouth unless some one else placed it there , and this service one of the ladies rendered him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to give him anything to drink was impossible , or would have been so had not the landlord bored a reed , and putting one end in his mouth poured the wine into him through the other; all which he bore with patience rather than sever the ribbons of his helmet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but still it distressed him to think he had not been dubbed a knight , for it was plain to him he could not lawfully engage in any adventure without receiving the order of knighthood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i looked for no less , my lord , from your high magnificence , replied don quixote ,  - and i have to tell you that the boon i have asked and your liberality has granted is that you shall dub me knight to - morrow morning , and that to - night i shall watch my arms in the chapel of this your castle; thus to - morrow , as i have said , will be accomplished what i so much desire , enabling me lawfully to roam through all the four quarters of the world seeking adventures on behalf of those in distress , as is the duty of chivalry and of knights - errant like myself , whose ambition is directed to such deeds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlord , who , as has been mentioned , was something of a wag , and had already some suspicion of his guest s want of wits , was quite convinced of it on hearing talk of this kind from him , and to make sport for the night he determined to fall in with his humour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he told him , moreover , that in this castle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour , as it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt , but that in a case of necessity it might , he knew , be watched anywhere , and he might watch it that night in a courtyard of the castle , and in the morning , god willing , the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him dubbed a knight , and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this point the landlord told him he was mistaken; for , though not recorded in the histories , because in the author s opinion there was no need to mention anything so obvious and necessary as money and clean shirts , it was not to be supposed therefore that they did not carry them , and he might regard it as certain and established that all knights - errant ( about whom there were so many full and unimpeachable books ) carried well - furnished purses in case of emergency , and likewise carried shirts and a little box of ointment to cure the wounds they received . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for in those plains and deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded , it was not always that there was some one to cure them , unless indeed they had for a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by fetching through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of their hurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had not received any damage whatever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but in case this should not occur , the knights of old took care to see that their squires were provided with money and other requisites , such as lint and ointments for healing purposes; and when it happened that knights had no squires ( which was rarely and seldom the case ) they themselves carried everything in cunning saddle - bags that were hardly seen on the horse s croup , as if it were something else of more importance , because , unless for some such reason , carrying saddle - bags was not very favourably regarded among knights - errant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he therefore advised him ( and , as his godson so soon to be , he might even command him ) never from that time forth to travel without money and the usual requirements , and he would find the advantage of them when he least expected it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously , and it was arranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at one side of the inn; so , collecting it all together , don quixote placed it on a trough that stood by the side of a well , and bracing his buckler on his arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and down in front of the trough , and as he began his march night began to fall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of his guest , the watching of the armour , and the dubbing ceremony he contemplated . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing this , don quixote raised his eyes to heaven , and fixing his thoughts , apparently , upon his lady dulcinea , exclaimed ,  - aid me , lady mine , in this the first encounter that presents itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail me in this first jeopardy; and , with these words and others to the same purpose , dropping his buckler he lifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such a blow on the carrier s head that he stretched him on the ground , so stunned that had he followed it up with a second there would have been no need of a surgeon to cure him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this done , he picked up his armour and returned to his beat with the same serenity as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shortly after this , another , not knowing what had happened ( for the carrier still lay senseless ) , came with the same object of giving water to his mules , and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear the trough , when don quixote , without uttering a word or imploring aid from anyone , once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his lance , and without actually breaking the second carrier s head into pieces , made more than three of it , for he laid it open in four . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing this , don quixote braced his buckler on his arm , and with his hand on his sword exclaimed ,  - o lady of beauty , strength and support of my faint heart , it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy greatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an adventure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by this he felt himself so inspired that he would not have flinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the comrades of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance to shower stones on don quixote , who screened himself as best he could with his buckler , not daring to quit the trough and leave his armour unprotected . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlord shouted to them to leave him alone , for he had already told them that he was mad , and as a madman he would not be accountable even if he killed them all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> still louder shouted don quixote , calling them knaves and traitors , and the lord of the castle , who allowed knights - errant to be treated in this fashion , a villain and a low - born knight whom , had he received the order of knighthood , he would call to account for his treachery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but of you , he cried ,  - base and vile rabble , i make no account; fling , strike , come on , do all ye can against me , ye shall see what the reward of your folly and insolence will be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the landlord , so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at once the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure could occur; so , going up to him , he apologised for the rudeness which , without his knowledge , had been offered to him by these low people , who , however , had been well punished for their audacity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he had already told him , he said , there was no chapel in the castle , nor was it needed for what remained to be done , for , as he understood the ceremonial of the order , the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder , and that could be administered in the middle of a field; and that he had now done all that was needful as to watching the armour , for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours only , while he had been more than four about it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus warned and menaced , the castellan forthwith brought out a book in which he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the carriers , and , with a lad carrying a candle - end , and the two damsels already mentioned , he returned to where don quixote stood , and bade him kneel down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , reading from his account - book as if he were repeating some devout prayer , in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and gave him a sturdy blow on the neck , and then , with his own sword , a smart slap on the shoulder , all the while muttering between his teeth as if he was saying his prayers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having done this , he directed one of the ladies to gird on his sword , which she did with great self - possession and gravity , and not a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they had already seen of the novice knight s prowess kept their laughter within bounds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on girding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him ,  - may god make your worship a very fortunate knight , and grant you success in battle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote asked her name in order that he might from that time forward know to whom he was beholden for the favour he had received , as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she promised she would , and then the other buckled on his spur , and with her followed almost the same conversation as with the lady of the sword . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked her name , and she said it was la molinera , and that she was the daughter of a respectable miller of antequera; and of her likewise don quixote requested that she would adopt the  - don and call herself dona molinera , making offers to her further services and favours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having thus , with hot haste and speed , brought to a conclusion these never - till - now - seen ceremonies , don quixote was on thorns until he saw himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling rocinante at once he mounted , and embracing his host , as he returned thanks for his kindness in knighting him , he addressed him in language so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlord , to get him out of the inn , replied with no less rhetoric though with shorter words , and without calling upon him to pay the reckoning let him go with a godspeed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this object he turned his horse s head towards his village , and rocinante , thus reminded of his old quarters , stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to tread the earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not gone far , when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to come feeble cries as of some one in distress , and the instant he heard them he exclaimed ,  - thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me , that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation i have undertaken , and gathering the fruit of my ambition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these cries , no doubt , come from some man or woman in want of help , and needing my aid and protection; and wheeling , he turned rocinante in the direction whence the cries seemed to proceed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had gone but a few paces into the wood , when he saw a mare tied to an oak , and tied to another , and stripped from the waist upwards , a youth of about fifteen years of age , from whom the cries came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor were they without cause , for a lusty farmer was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings and commands , repeating ,  - your mouth shut and your eyes open! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while the youth made answer ,  - i won t do it again , master mine; by god s passion i won t do it again , and i ll take more care of the flock another time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing what was going on , don quixote said in an angry voice ,  - discourteous knight , it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend himself; mount your steed and take your lance ( for there was a lance leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied ) ,  - and i will make you know that you are behaving as a coward . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the farmer , seeing before him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head , gave himself up for dead , and made answer meekly ,  - sir knight , this youth that i am chastising is my servant , employed by me to watch a flock of sheep that i have hard by , and he is so careless that i lose one every day , and when i punish him for his carelessness and knavery he says i do it out of niggardliness , to escape paying him the wages i owe him , and before god , and on my soul , he lies . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - lies before me , base clown! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the sun that shines on us i have a mind to run you through with this lance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> pay him at once without another word; if not , by the god that rules us i will make an end of you , and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the farmer hung his head , and without a word untied his servant , of whom don quixote asked how much his master owed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote added it up , found that it came to sixty - three reals , and told the farmer to pay it down immediately , if he did not want to die for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the difficulty is , sir knight , that i have no money here; let andres come home with me , and i will pay him all , real by real . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i go with him! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the youth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , god forbid! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no , seor , not for the world; for once alone with me , he would flay me like a saint bartholomew . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he will do nothing of the kind , said don quixote;  - i have only to command , and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of knighthood which he has received , i leave him free , and i guarantee the payment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - consider what you are saying , seor , said the youth;  - this master of mine is not a knight , nor has he received any order of knighthood; for he is juan haldudo the rich , of quintanar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that matters little , replied don quixote;  - there may be haldudos knights; moreover , everyone is the son of his works . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for the perfumery i excuse you , said don quixote;  - give it to him in reals , and i shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn; if not , by the same oath i swear to come back and hunt you out and punish you; and i shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - my oath on it , too , said the farmer;  - but as i have a strong affection for you , i want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment; and seizing him by the arm , he tied him up again , and gave him such a flogging that he left him for dead . </s> </s>

<s> <s> since it has fallen to thy lot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renowned as is and will be don quixote of la mancha , who , as all the world knows , yesterday received the order of knighthood , and hath to - day righted the greatest wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to - day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child . </s> </s>

<s> <s> don quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the marquis of mantua , his uncle , so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad , in which he told the tale of his misfortune , and of the loves of the emperor s son and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense , and relieving him of the visor , already battered to pieces by blows , he wiped his face , which was covered with dust , and as soon as he had done so he recognised him and said ,  - seor quixada ( for so he appears to have been called when he was in his senses and had not yet changed from a quiet country gentleman into a knight - errant ) ,  - who has brought your worship to this pass? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then contrived to raise him from the ground , and with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass , which seemed to him to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms , even to the splinters of the lance , he tied them on rocinante , and leading him by the bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village , very sad to hear what absurd stuff don quixote was talking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor was don quixote less so , for what with blows and bruises he could not sit upright on the ass , and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven , so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and it could have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to match his own adventures , for now , forgetting baldwin , he bethought himself of the moor abindarraez , when the alcaide of antequera , rodrigo de narvaez , took him prisoner and carried him away to his castle; so that when the peasant again asked him how he was and what ailed him , he gave him for reply the same words and phrases that the captive abindarraez gave to rodrigo de narvaez , just as he had read the story in the  - diana of jorge de montemayor where it is written , applying it to his own case so aptly that the peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to listen to such a lot of nonsense; from which , however , he came to the conclusion that his neighbour was mad , and so made all haste to reach the village to escape the wearisomeness of this harangue of don quixote s; who , at the end of it , said ,  - seor don rodrigo de narvaez , your worship must know that this fair xarifa i have mentioned is now the lovely dulcinea del toboso , for whom i have done , am doing , and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that in this world have been seen , are to be seen , or ever shall be seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as night was beginning to fall , but the peasant waited until it was a little later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such a miserable trim . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the niece said the same , and , more:  - you must know , master nicholasfor that was the name of the barber - it was often my uncle s way to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy books of misventures , after which he would fling the book away and snatch up his sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he would say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat that flowed from him when he was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he had received in battle; and then he would drink a great jug of cold water and become calm and quiet , saying that this water was a most precious potion which the sage esquife , a great magician and friend of his , had brought him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i take all the blame upon myself for never having told your worships of my uncle s vagaries , that you might put a stop to them before things had come to this pass , and burn all these accursed booksfor he has a great numberthat richly deserve to be burned like heretics . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this the peasant heard , and from it he understood at last what was the matter with his neighbour , so he began calling aloud ,  - open , your worships , to seor baldwin and to seor the marquis of mantua , who comes badly wounded , and to seor abindarraez , the moor , whom the valiant rodrigo de narvaez , the alcaide of antequera , brings captive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at these words they all hurried out , and when they recognised their friend , master , and uncle , who had not yet dismounted from the ass because he could not , they ran to embrace him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hold! </s> </s>

<s> <s> to bed with your worship at once , and we will contrive to cure you here without fetching that hurgada . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a curse i say once more , and a hundred times more , on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they carried him to bed at once , and after searching for his wounds could find none , but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe fall with his horse rocinante when in combat with ten giants , the biggest and the boldest to be found on earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , so! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the curate ,  - are there giants in the dance? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by the sign of the cross i will burn them to - morrow before the day is over . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they put a host of questions to don quixote , but his only answer to all wasgive him something to eat , and leave him to sleep , for that was what he needed most . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did so , and the curate questioned the peasant at great length as to how he had found don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the room where the books , the authors of all the mischief , were , and right willingly she gave them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they all went in , the housekeeper with them , and found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well bound , and some other small ones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moment the housekeeper saw them she turned about and ran out of the room , and came back immediately with a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler , saying ,  - here , your worship , seor licentiate , sprinkle this room; don t leave any magician of the many there are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for our design of banishing them from the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh , and he directed the barber to give him the books one by one to see what they were about , as there might be some to be found among them that did not deserve the penalty of fire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said the niece ,  - there is no reason for showing mercy to any of them; they have every one of them done mischief; better fling them out of the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to them; or else carry them into the yard , and there a bonfire can be made without the smoke giving any annoyance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the housekeeper said the same , so eager were they both for the slaughter of those innocents , but the curate would not agree to it without first reading at any rate the titles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first that master nicholas put into his hand was  - the four books of amadis of gaul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this seems a mysterious thing , said the curate ,  - for , as i have heard say , this was the first book of chivalry printed in spain , and from this all the others derive their birth and origin; so it seems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flames as the founder of so vile a sect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let us see that other which is next to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is , said the barber ,  - the sergas de esplandian ,  the lawful son of amadis of gaul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> take it , mistress housekeeper; open the window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the pile for the bonfire we are to make . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - proceed , said the curate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this that comes next , said the barber ,  - is amadis of greece ,  and , indeed , i believe all those on this side are of the same amadis lineage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then to the yard with the whole of them , said the curate;  - for to have the burning of queen pintiquiniestra , and the shepherd darinel and his eclogues , and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author , i would burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about in the guise of a knight - errant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am of the same mind , said the barber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who is that tub there? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this , said the barber ,  - is don olivante de laura . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - the author of that book , said the curate ,  - was the same that wrote the garden of flowers ,  and truly there is no deciding which of the two books is the more truthful , or , to put it better , the less lying; all i can say is , send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this that follows is florismarte of hircania ,  said the barber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - seor florismarte here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the curate;  - then by my faith he must take up his quarters in the yard , in spite of his marvellous birth and visionary adventures , for the stiffness and dryness of his style deserve nothing else; into the yard with him and the other , mistress housekeeper . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with all my heart , seor , said she , and executed the order with great delight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this , said the barber ,  - is the knight platir . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another book was opened , and they saw it was entitled ,  - the knight of the cross . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for the sake of the holy name this book has , said the curate ,  - its ignorance might be excused; but then , they say , behind the cross there s the devil; to the fire with it . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i know his worship , said the curate;  - that is where seor reinaldos of montalvan figures with his friends and comrades , greater thieves than cacus , and the twelve peers of france with the veracious historian turpin; however , i am not for condemning them to more than perpetual banishment , because , at any rate , they have some share in the invention of the famous matteo boiardo , whence too the christian poet ludovico ariosto wove his web , to whom , if i find him here , and speaking any language but his own , i shall show no respect whatever; but if he speaks his own tongue i will put him upon my head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , i have him in italian , said the barber ,  - but i do not understand him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nor would it be well that you should understand him , said the curate ,  - and on that score we might have excused the captain if he had not brought him into spain and turned him into castilian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he robbed him of a great deal of his natural force , and so do all those who try to turn books written in verse into another language , for , with all the pains they take and all the cleverness they show , they never can reach the level of the originals as they were first produced . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> opening another book he saw it was  - palmerin de oliva , and beside it was another called  - palmerin of england , seeing which the licentiate said ,  - let the olive be made firewood of at once and burned until no ashes even are left; and let that palm of england be kept and preserved as a thing that stands alone , and let such another case be made for it as that which alexander found among the spoils of darius and set aside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet homer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this book , gossip , is of authority for two reasons , first because it is very good , and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wise and witty king of portugal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the adventures at the castle of miraguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance , and the language is polished and clear , studying and observing the style befitting the speaker with propriety and judgment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , gossip , said the barber ,  - for this that i have here is the famous don belianis . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - well , said the curate ,  - that and the second , third , and fourth parts all stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile , and they must be cleared of all that stuff about the castle of fame and other greater affectations , to which end let them be allowed the over - seas term , and , according as they mend , so shall mercy or justice be meted out to them; and in the mean time , gossip , do you keep them in your house and let no one read them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with all my heart , said the barber; and not caring to tire himself with reading more books of chivalry , he told the housekeeper to take all the big ones and throw them into the yard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was not said to one dull or deaf , but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the broadest and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at a time , she flung them out of the window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the barber , who took it up , curious to know whose it was , and found it said ,  - history of the famous knight , tirante el blanco . </s> </s>

<s> <s> said the curate with a shout ,  - tirante el blanco  here! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - ah , seor! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the niece ,  - your worship had better order these to be burned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if , after being cured of his chivalry disorder , my uncle , by reading these , took a fancy to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and piping; or , what would be still worse , to turn poet , which they say is an incurable and infectious malady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the damsel is right , said the curate ,  - and it will be well to put this stumbling - block and temptation out of our friend s way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to begin , then , with the diana  of montemayor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am of opinion it should not be burned , but that it should be cleared of all that about the sage felicia and the magic water , and of almost all the longer pieces of verse: let it keep , and welcome , its prose and the honour of being the first of books of the kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this that comes next , said the barber ,  - is the diana ,  entitled the second part , by the salamancan ,  and this other has the same title , and its author is gil polo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as for that of the salamancan , replied the curate ,  - let it go to swell the number of the condemned in the yard , and let gil polo s be preserved as if it came from apollo himself: but get on , gossip , and make haste , for it is growing late . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this book , said the barber , opening another ,  - is the ten books of the fortune of love ,  written by antonio de lofraso , a sardinian poet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by the orders i have received , said the curate ,  - since apollo has been apollo , and the muses have been muses , and poets have been poets , so droll and absurd a book as this has never been written , and in its way it is the best and the most singular of all of this species that have as yet appeared , and he who has not read it may be sure he has never read what is delightful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> give it here , gossip , for i make more account of having found it than if they had given me a cassock of florence stuff . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he put it aside with extreme satisfaction , and the barber went on ,  - these that come next are the shepherd of iberia ,  nymphs of henares ,  and the enlightenment of jealousy . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - then all we have to do , said the curate ,  - is to hand them over to the secular arm of the housekeeper , and ask me not why , or we shall never have done . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this next is the pastor de filida . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this large one here , said the barber ,  - is called the treasury of various poems . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - if there were not so many of them , said the curate ,  - they would be more relished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain vulgarities which it has with its excellences; let it be preserved because the author is a friend of mine , and out of respect for other more heroic and loftier works that he has written . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this , continued the barber ,  - is the cancionero  of lopez de maldonado . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the author of that book , too , said the curate ,  - is a great friend of mine , and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who hear them , for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when he chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues , but what is good was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been set apart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what book is that next it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the galatea  of miguel de cervantes , said the barber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine , and to my knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his book has some good invention in it , it presents us with something but brings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the second part it promises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full measure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you , seor gossip , keep it shut up in your own quarters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very good , said the barber;  - and here come three together , the araucana  of don alonso de ercilla , the austriada  of juan rufo , justice of cordova , and the montserrate  of christobal de virues , the valencian poet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - these three books , said the curate ,  - are the best that have been written in castilian in heroic verse , and they may compare with the most famous of italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of poetry that spain possesses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curate was tired and would not look into any more books , and so he decided that ,  - contents uncertified , all the rest should be burned; but just then the barber held open one , called  - the tears of angelica . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i should have shed tears myself , said the curate when he heard the title ,  - had i ordered that book to be burned , for its author was one of the famous poets of the world , not to say of spain , and was very happy in the translation of some of ovid s fables . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this instant don quixote began shouting out ,  - here , here , valiant knights! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when they reached don quixote he was already out of bed , and was still shouting and raving , and slashing and cutting all round , as wide awake as if he had never slept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they closed with him and by force got him back to bed , and when he had become a little calm , addressing the curate , he said to him ,  - of a truth , seor archbishop turpin , it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves the twelve peers , so carelessly to allow the knights of the court to gain the victory in this tourney , we the adventurers having carried off the honour on the three former days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wounded no , said don quixote ,  - but bruised and battered no doubt , for that bastard don roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree , and all for envy , because he sees that i alone rival him in his achievements . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but i should not call myself reinaldos of montalvan did he not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as i rise from this bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the present let them bring me something to eat , for that , i feel , is what will be more to my purpose , and leave it to me to avenge myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did as he wished; they gave him something to eat , and once more he fell asleep , leaving them marvelling at his madness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in the yard and in the whole house; and some must have been consumed that deserved preservation in everlasting archives , but their fate and the laziness of the examiner did not permit it , and so in them was verified the proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> two days later don quixote got up , and the first thing he did was to go and look at his books , and not finding the room where he had left it , he wandered from side to side looking for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he came to the place where the door used to be , and tried it with his hands , and turned and twisted his eyes in every direction without saying a word; but after a good while he asked his housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held his books . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the housekeeper , who had been already well instructed in what she was to answer , said ,  - what room or what nothing is it that your worship is looking for? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there are neither room nor books in this house now , for the devil himself has carried all away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was not the devil , said the niece ,  - but a magician who came on a cloud one night after the day your worship left this , and dismounting from a serpent that he rode he entered the room , and what he did there i know not , but after a little while he made off , flying through the roof , and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he had done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well , the housekeeper and i , that on leaving , the old villain said in a loud voice that , for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room , he had done mischief in that house that would be discovered by - and - by: he said too that his name was the sage munaton . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t know whether he called himself friston or friton , said the housekeeper ,  - i only know that his name ended with ton . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - so it does , said don quixote ,  - and he is a sage magician , a great enemy of mine , who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts and lore that in process of time i am to engage in single combat with a knight whom he befriends and that i am to conquer , and he will be unable to prevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns that he can; but i promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid what is decreed by heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - who doubts that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - oh , niece of mine , replied don quixote ,  - how much astray art thou in thy reckoning: ere they shear me i shall have plucked away and stripped off the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the two were unwilling to make any further answer , as they saw that his anger was kindling . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , then , he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without showing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions , and during this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips , the curate and the barber , on the point he maintained , that knights - errant were what the world stood most in need of , and that in him was to be accomplished the revival of knight - errantry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile don quixote worked upon a farm labourer , a neighbour of his , an honest man ( if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor ) , but with very little wit in his pate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a word , he so talked him over , and with such persuasions and promises , that the poor clown made up his mind to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote , among other things , told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly , because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on these and the like promises sancho panza ( for so the labourer was called ) left wife and children , and engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and pawning another , and making a bad bargain in every case , he got together a fair sum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he provided himself with a buckler , which he begged as a loan from a friend , and , restoring his battered helmet as best he could , he warned his squire sancho of the day and hour he meant to set out , that he might provide himself with what he thought most needful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> above all , he charged him to take alforjas with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other said he would , and that he meant to take also a very good ass he had , as he was not much given to going on foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for all that , however , he determined to take him , intending to furnish him with a more honourable mount when a chance of it presented itself , by appropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> himself he provided with shirts and such other things as he could , according to the advice the host had given him; all which being done , without taking leave , sancho panza of his wife and children , or don quixote of his housekeeper and niece , they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night , and made such good way in the course of it that by daylight they held themselves safe from discovery , even should search be made for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch , with his alforjas and bota , and longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master had promised him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he had taken on his first journey , that over the campo de montiel , which he travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion , for , as it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely , the heat did not distress them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which don quixote replied ,  - thou must know , friend sancho panza , that it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights - errant of old to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won , and i am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a custom; on the contrary , i mean to improve upon it , for they sometimes , and perhaps most frequently , waited until their squires were old , and then when they had had enough of service and hard days and worse nights , they gave them some title or other , of count , or at the most marquis , of some valley or province more or less; but if thou livest and i live , it may well be that before six days are over , i may have won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it , which will be just the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor needst thou count this wonderful , for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that i might easily give thee even more than i promise thee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let me tell you , seor , she is not worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better , and that only with god s help . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - leave it to god , sancho , returned don quixote ,  - for he will give her what suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to be content with anything less than being governor of a province . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will not , seor , answered sancho ,  - specially as i have a man of such quality for a master in your worship , who will know how to give me all that will be suitable for me and that i can bear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that there are on that plain , and as soon as don quixote saw them he said to his squire ,  - fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires ourselves , for look there , friend sancho panza , where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves , all of whom i mean to engage in battle and slay , and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare , and it is god s good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what giants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sancho panza . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look , your worship , said sancho;  - what we see there are not giants but windmills , and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , he gave the spur to his steed rocinante , heedless of the cries his squire sancho sent after him , warning him that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he was going to attack . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he , however , was so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of sancho , nor perceived , near as he was , what they were , but made at them shouting ,  - fly not , cowards and vile beings , for a single knight attacks you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , and commending himself with all his heart to his lady dulcinea , imploring her to support him in such a peril , with lance in rest and covered by his buckler , he charged at rocinante s fullest gallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove his lance - point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force that it shivered the lance to pieces , sweeping with it horse and rider , who went rolling over on the plain , in a sorry condition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could go , and when he came up found him unable to move , with such a shock had rocinante fallen with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sancho ,  - did i not tell your worship to mind what you were about , for they were only windmills? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and no one could have made any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush , friend sancho , replied don quixote ,  - the fortunes of war more than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover i think , and it is the truth , that that same sage friston who carried off my study and books , has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the glory of vanquishing them , such is the enmity he bears me; but in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - god order it as he may , said sancho panza , and helping him to rise got him up again on rocinante , whose shoulder was half out; and then , discussing the late adventure , they followed the road to puerto lapice , for there , said don quixote , they could not fail to find adventures in abundance and variety , as it was a great thoroughfare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i mention this because from the first oak i see i mean to rend such another branch , large and stout like that , with which i am determined and resolved to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found worthy to come and see them , and be an eyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be that as god will , said sancho ,  - i believe it all as your worship says it; but straighten yourself a little , for you seem all on one side , may be from the shaking of the fall . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is the truth , said don quixote ,  - and if i make no complaint of the pain it is because knights - errant are not permitted to complain of any wound , even though their bowels be coming out through it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if so , said sancho ,  - i have nothing to say; but god knows i would rather your worship complained when anything ailed you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for my part , i confess i must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule about not complaining extends to the squires of knights - errant also . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote could not help laughing at his squire s simplicity , and he assured him he might complain whenever and however he chose , just as he liked , for , so far , he had never read of anything to the contrary in the order of knighthood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this permission sancho settled himself as comfortably as he could on his beast , and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowed away in them , he jogged along behind his master munching deliberately , and from time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in malaga might have envied; and while he went on in this way , gulping down draught after draught , he never gave a thought to any of the promises his master had made him , nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures , however dangerous they might be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not so did sancho panza spend it , for having his stomach full of something stronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it , and , if his master had not called him , neither the rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on getting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than the night before , which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the deficiency readily . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - here , brother sancho panza , said don quixote when he saw it ,  - we may plunge our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe , even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world , thou must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence , unless indeed thou perceivest that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in that case thou mayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights it is on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to help me until thou hast been dubbed a knight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - most certainly , seor , replied sancho ,  - your worship shall be fully obeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself i am peaceful and no friend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the defence of my own person i shall not give much heed to those laws , for laws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any assailant whatever . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the friars , though going the same road , were not in her company; but the moment don quixote perceived them he said to his squire ,  - either i am mistaken , or this is going to be the most famous adventure that has ever been seen , for those black bodies we see there must be , and doubtless are , magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in that coach , and with all my might i must undo this wrong . </s> </s>

<s> <s> so saying , he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along which the friars were coming , and as soon as he thought they had come near enough to hear what he said , he cried aloud ,  - devilish and unnatural beings , release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carrying off by force in this coach , else prepare to meet a speedy death as the just punishment of your evil deeds . </s> </s>

<s> <s> at that instant the friars  muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him for . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the muleteers , who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils , seeing that don quixote was some distance off talking to the travellers in the coach , fell upon sancho , knocked him down , and leaving hardly a hair in his beard , belaboured him with kicks and left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and without any more delay helped the friar to mount , who , trembling , terrified , and pale , as soon as he found himself in the saddle , spurred after his companion , who was standing at a distance looking on , watching the result of the onslaught; then , not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun , they pursued their journey making more crosses than if they had the devil after them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote was , as has been said , speaking to the lady in the coach:  - your beauty , lady mine , said he ,  - may now dispose of your person as may be most in accordance with your pleasure , for the pride of your ravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer , know that i am called don quixote of la mancha , knight - errant and adventurer , and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady dulcinea del toboso: and in return for the service you have received of me i ask no more than that you should return to el toboso , and on my behalf present yourself before that lady and tell her what i have done to set you free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the squires in attendance upon the coach , a biscayan , was listening to all don quixote was saying , and , perceiving that he would not allow the coach to go on , but was saying it must return at once to el toboso , he made at him , and seizing his lance addressed him in bad castilian and worse biscayan after his fashion ,  - begone , caballero , and ill go with thee; by the god that made me , unless thou quittest coach , slayest thee as art here a biscayan . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the biscayan , when he saw him coming on , though he wished to dismount from his mule , in which , being one of those sorry ones let out for hire , he had no confidence , had no choice but to draw his sword; it was lucky for him , however , that he was near the coach , from which he was able to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at one another as if they had been two mortal enemies . </s> </s>

<s> <s> on , then , as aforesaid , came don quixote against the wary biscayan , with uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half , while on his side the biscayan waited for him sword in hand , and under the protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling , waiting in suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall , and the lady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand vows and offerings to all the images and shrines of spain , that god might deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in which they found themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true the second author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion , or that the wits of la mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to this famous knight; and this being his persuasion , he did not despair of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history , which , heaven favouring him , he did find in a way that shall be related in the second part . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the first part of this history we left the valiant biscayan and the renowned don quixote with drawn swords uplifted , ready to deliver two such furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they would at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid them open like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the delightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without any intimation from the author where what was missing was to be found . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this distressed me greatly , because the pleasure derived from having read such a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor chance that presented itself of finding the large part that , so it seemed to me , was missing of such an interesting tale . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous spaniard , don quixote of la mancha , light and mirror of manchegan chivalry , and the first that in our age and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise of the arms of knight - errantry , righting wrongs , succouring widows , and protecting damsels of that sort that used to ride about , whip in hand , on their palfreys , with all their virginity about them , from mountain to mountain and valley to valleyfor , if it were not for some ruffian , or boor with a hood and hatchet , or monstrous giant , that forced them , there were in days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years , in all which time they had never slept a day under a roof , went to their graves as much maids as the mothers that bore them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say , then , that in these and other respects our gallant don quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable praise , nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and pains spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though i know well that if heaven , chance and good fortune had not helped me , the world would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasure that for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read it attentively . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the discovery of it occurred in this way . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i bade him tell it to me; and he still laughing said ,  - in the margin , as i told you , this is written: this dulcinea del toboso so often mentioned in this history , had , they say , the best hand of any woman in all la mancha for salting pigs . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when i heard dulcinea del toboso named , i was struck with surprise and amazement , for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained the history of don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this idea i pressed him to read the beginning , and doing so , turning the arabic offhand into castilian , he told me it meant ,  - history of don quixote of la mancha , written by cid hamete benengeli , an arab historian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it required great caution to hide the joy i felt when the title of the book reached my ears , and snatching it from the silk mercer , i bought all the papers and pamphlets from the boy for half a real; and if he had had his wits about him and had known how eager i was for them , he might have safely calculated on making more than six reals by the bargain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was satisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat , and promised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch; but to make the matter easier , and not to let such a precious find out of my hands , i took him to my house , where in little more than a month and a half he translated the whole just as it is set down here . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the biscayan had an inscription under his feet which said ,  - don sancho de azpeitia , which no doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of rocinante was another that said ,  - don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rocinante was marvellously portrayed , so long and thin , so lank and lean , with so much backbone and so far gone in consumption , that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the name of rocinante had been bestowed upon him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> near him was sancho panza holding the halter of his ass , at whose feet was another label that said ,  - sancho zancas , and according to the picture , he must have had a big belly , a short body , and long shanks , for which reason , no doubt , the names of panza and zancas were given him , for by these two surnames the history several times calls him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> some other trifling particulars might be mentioned , but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with the true relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long as it is true . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its truth , it can only be that its author was an arab , as lying is a very common propensity with those of that nation; though , as they are such enemies of ours , it is conceivable that there were omissions rather than additions made in the course of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and this is my own opinion; for , where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so worthy a knight , he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in silence; which is ill done and worse contrived , for it is the business and duty of historians to be exact , truthful , and wholly free from passion , and neither interest nor fear , hatred nor love , should make them swerve from the path of truth , whose mother is history , rival of time , storehouse of deeds , witness for the past , example and counsel for the present , and warning for the future . </s> </s>

<s> <s> to be brief , its second part , according to the translation , began in this way: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with trenchant swords upraised and poised on high , it seemed as though the two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven , and earth , and hell , with such resolution and determination did they bear themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fiery biscayan was the first to strike a blow , which was delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in its course , that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the bitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that good fortune which reserved him for greater things , turned aside the sword of his adversary , so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder , it did him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour , carrying away a great part of his helmet with half of his ear , all which with fearful ruin fell to the ground , leaving him in a sorry plight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> good god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that can be said is , it was such that he again raised himself in his stirrups , and , grasping his sword more firmly with both hands , he came down on the biscayan with such fury , smiting him full over the cushion and over the head , thateven so good a shield proving uselessas if a mountain had fallen on him , he began to bleed from nose , mouth , and ears , reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule , as no doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about its neck; at the same time , however , he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then unclasped his arms , and the mule , taking fright at the terrible blow , made off across the plain , and with a few plunges flung its master to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote stood looking on very calmly , and , when he saw him fall , leaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him , and , presenting the point of his sword to his eyes , bade him surrender , or he would cut his head off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable to answer a word , and it would have gone hard with him , so blind was don quixote , had not the ladies in the coach , who had hitherto been watching the combat in great terror , hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnest entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their squire s life; to which don quixote replied with much gravity and dignity ,  - in truth , fair ladies , i am well content to do what ye ask of me; but it must be on one condition and understanding , which is that this knight promise me to go to the village of el toboso , and on my behalf present himself before the peerless lady dulcinea , that she deal with him as shall be most pleasing to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then , on the faith of that promise , said don quixote ,  - i shall do him no further harm , though he well deserves it of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now by this time sancho had risen , rather the worse for the handling of the friars  muleteers , and stood watching the battle of his master , don quixote , and praying to god in his heart that it might be his will to grant him the victory , and that he might thereby win some island to make him governor of , as he had promised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing , therefore , that the struggle was now over , and that his master was returning to mount rocinante , he approached to hold the stirrup for him , and , before he could mount , he went on his knees before him , and taking his hand , kissed it saying ,  - may it please your worship , seor don quixote , to give me the government of that island which has been won in this hard fight , for be it ever so big i feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as well as anyone in the world who has ever governed islands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho followed him at his ass s best trot , but rocinante stepped out so that , seeing himself left behind , he was forced to call to his master to wait for him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote did so , reining in rocinante until his weary squire came up , who on reaching him said ,  - it seems to me , seor , it would be prudent in us to go and take refuge in some church , for , seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has been left , it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the holy brotherhood and arrest us , and , faith , if they do , before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - peace , said don quixote;  - where hast thou ever seen or heard that a knight - errant has been arraigned before a court of justice , however many homicides he may have committed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i know nothing about omecils , answered sancho ,  - nor in my life have had anything to do with one; i only know that the holy brotherhood looks after those who fight in the fields , and in that other matter i do not meddle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but tell me , as thou livest , hast thou seen a more valiant knight than i in all the known world; hast thou read in history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack , more spirit in maintaining it , more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all that might be well dispensed with , said don quixote ,  - if i had remembered to make a vial of the balsam of fierabras , for time and medicine are saved by one single drop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what vial and what balsam is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sancho panza . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is a balsam , answered don quixote ,  - the receipt of which i have in my memory , with which one need have no fear of death , or dread dying of any wound; and so when i make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to do when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the middle of the bodyas is wont to happen frequentlybut neatly and with great nicety , ere the blood congeal , to place that portion of the body which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half which remains in the saddle , taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if that be so , said panza ,  - i renounce henceforth the government of the promised island , and desire nothing more in payment of my many and faithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of this supreme liquor , for i am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals an ounce anywhere , and i want no more to pass the rest of my life in ease and honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with less than three reals , six quarts of it may be made , said don quixote . </s> </s>

<s> <s> said sancho ,  - then why does your worship put off making it and teaching it to me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - peace , friend , answered don quixote;  - greater secrets i mean to teach thee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for the present let us see to the dressing , for my ear pains me more than i could wish . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when don quixote came to see his helmet shattered , he was like to lose his senses , and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven , he said ,  - i swear by the creator of all things and the four gospels in their fullest extent , to do as the great marquis of mantua did when he swore to avenge the death of his nephew baldwin ( and that was not to eat bread from a table - cloth , nor embrace his wife , and other points which , though i cannot now call them to mind , i here grant as expressed ) until i take complete vengeance upon him who has committed such an offence against me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thou hast said well and hit the point , answered don quixote; and so i recall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him , but i make and confirm it anew to lead the life i have said until such time as i take by force from some knight another helmet such as this and as good; and think not , sancho , that i am raising smoke with straw in doing so , for i have one to imitate in the matter , since the very same thing to a hair happened in the case of mambrino s helmet , which cost sacripante so dear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - seor , replied sancho ,  - let your worship send all such oaths to the devil , for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the conscience; just tell me now , if for several days to come we fall in with no man armed with a helmet , what are we to do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is the oath to be observed in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to sleep in your clothes , and not to sleep in a house , and a thousand other mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the marquis of mantua , which your worship is now wanting to revive? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thou art wrong there , said don quixote ,  - for we shall not have been above two hours among these cross - roads before we see more men in armour than came to albraca to win the fair angelica . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - enough , said sancho;  - so be it then , and god grant us success , and that the time for winning that island which is costing me so dear may soon come , and then let me die . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but let us leave that to its own time; see if thou hast anything for us to eat in those alforjas , because we must presently go in quest of some castle where we may lodge to - night and make the balsam i told thee of , for i swear to thee by god , this ear is giving me great pain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread , said sancho ,  - but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like your worship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how little thou knowest about it , answered don quixote;  - i would have thee to know , sancho , that it is the glory of knights - errant to go without eating for a month , and even when they do eat , that it should be of what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee hadst thou read as many histories as i have , for , though they are very many , among them all i have found no mention made of knights - errant eating , unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for them , and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - pardon me , your worship , said sancho ,  - for , as i cannot read or write , as i said just now , i neither know nor comprehend the rules of the profession of chivalry: henceforward i will stock the alforjas with every kind of dry fruit for your worship , as you are a knight; and for myself , as i am not one , i will furnish them with poultry and other things more substantial . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not say , sancho , replied don quixote ,  - that it is imperative on knights - errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest of; only that their more usual diet must be those , and certain herbs they found in the fields which they knew and i know too . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a good thing it is , answered sancho ,  - to know those herbs , for to my thinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into practice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and here taking out what he said he had brought , the pair made their repast peaceably and sociably . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote seated himself , and sancho remained standing to serve the cup , which was made of horn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing him standing , his master said to him: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that thou mayest see , sancho , the good that knight - errantry contains in itself , and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road to be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world , i desire that thou seat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people , and that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord , and that thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever i drink from; for the same may be said of knight - errantry as of love , that it levels all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - great thanks , said sancho ,  - but i may tell your worship that provided i have enough to eat , i can eat it as well , or better , standing , and by myself , than seated alongside of an emperor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and indeed , if the truth is to be told , what i eat in my corner without form or fuss has much more relish for me , even though it be bread and onions , than the turkeys of those other tables where i am forced to chew slowly , drink little , wipe my mouth every minute , and cannot sneeze or cough if i want or do other things that are the privileges of liberty and solitude . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , seor , as for these honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant and follower of knight - errantry , exchange them for other things which may be of more use and advantage to me; for these , though i fully acknowledge them as received , i renounce from this moment to the end of the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for all that , said don quixote ,  - thou must seat thyself , because him who humbleth himself god exalteth; and seizing him by the arm he forced him to sit down beside himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and knights - errant , and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at their guests , who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces as big as one s fist . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the course of meat finished , they spread upon the sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns , and with them they put down a half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when don quixote had quite appeased his appetite he took up a handful of the acorns , and contemplating them attentively delivered himself somewhat in this fashion: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - happy the age , happy the time , to which the ancients gave the name of golden , not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this our iron one was gained without toil , but because they that lived in it knew not the two words  - mine and  - thine! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in that blessed age all things were in common; to win the daily food no labour was required of any save to stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks that stood generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the clear streams and running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in noble abundance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in the clefts of the rocks and hollows of the trees , offering without usance the plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mighty cork trees , unenforced save of their own courtesy , shed the broad light bark that served at first to roof the houses supported by rude stakes , a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then was it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill , with flowing locks , and no more garments than were needful modestly to cover what modesty seeks and ever sought to hide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor were their ornaments like those in use to - day , set off by tyrian purple , and silk tortured in endless fashions , but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy , wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our court dames with all the rare and far - fetched artifices that idle curiosity has taught them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> arbitrary law had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge , for then there was no cause to judge and no one to be judged . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - eclipse it is called , friend , not cris , the darkening of those two luminaries , said don quixote; but pedro , not troubling himself with trifles , went on with his story , saying ,  - also he foretold when the year was going to be one of abundance or estility . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - that science is called astrology , said don quixote . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i forgot to say that chrysostom , who is dead , was a great man for writing verses , so much so that he made carols for christmas eve , and plays for corpus christi , which the young men of our village acted , and all said they were excellent . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> about this time the father of our chrysostom died , and he was left heir to a large amount of property in chattels as well as in land , no small number of cattle and sheep , and a large sum of money , of all of which the young man was left dissolute owner , and indeed he was deserving of it all , for he was a very good comrade , and kind - hearted , and a friend of worthy folk , and had a countenance like a benediction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> presently it came to be known that he had changed his dress with no other object than to wander about these wastes after that shepherdess marcela our lad mentioned a while ago , with whom the deceased chrysostom had fallen in love . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - pardon me , friend , said don quixote;  - but , as there is such a difference between sarna and sarra , i told you of it; however , you have answered very rightly , for sarna lives longer than sarra: so continue your story , and i will not object any more to anything . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her husband guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a wife , leaving his daughter marcela , a child and rich , to the care of an uncle of hers , a priest and prebendary in our village . </s> </s>

<s> <s> to proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before his niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular of the many who had asked her in marriage , begging her to marry and make a choice according to her own taste , she never gave any other answer than that she had no desire to marry just yet , and that being so young she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony . </s> </s>

<s> <s> for although she does not avoid or shun the society and conversation of the shepherds , and treats them courteously and kindly , should any one of them come to declare his intention to her , though it be one as proper and holy as that of matrimony , she flings him from her like a catapult . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and with this kind of disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plague had got into it , for her affability and her beauty draw on the hearts of those that associate with her to love her and to court her , but her scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so they know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard - hearted , and other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of her character; and if you should remain here any time , seor , you would hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the rejected ones who pursue her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not far from this there is a spot where there are a couple of dozen of tall beeches , and there is not one of them but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of marcela , and above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover would say more plainly that marcela wore and deserved that of all human beauty . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the east , when five of the six goatherds came to rouse don quixote and tell him that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of chrysostom they would bear him company . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the traveller answered that the same morning they had met these shepherds , and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they had asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which one of them gave , describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a shepherdess called marcela , and the loves of many who courted her , together with the death of that chrysostom to whose burial they were going . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , he repeated all that pedro had related to don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this conversation dropped , and another was commenced by him who was called vivaldo asking don quixote what was the reason that led him to go armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which don quixote replied ,  - the pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go in any other fashion; easy life , enjoyment , and repose were invented for soft courtiers , but toil , unrest , and arms were invented and made for those alone whom the world calls knights - errant , of whom i , though unworthy , am the least of all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the instant they heard this all set him down as mad , and the better to settle the point and discover what kind of madness his was , vivaldo proceeded to ask him what knights - errant meant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have not your worships , replied don quixote ,  - read the annals and histories of england , in which are recorded the famous deeds of king arthur , whom we in our popular castilian invariably call king artus , with regard to whom it is an ancient tradition , and commonly received all over that kingdom of great britain , that this king did not die , but was changed by magic art into a raven , and that in process of time he is to return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which reason it cannot be proved that from that time to this any englishman ever killed a raven? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , then , sirs , is to be a knight - errant , and what i have spoken of is the order of his chivalry , of which , as i have already said , i , though a sinner , have made profession , and what the aforesaid knights professed that same do i profess , and so i go through these solitudes and wilds seeking adventures , resolved in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most perilous that fortune may offer me in aid of the weak and needy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of don quixote s being out of his senses and of the form of madness that overmastered him , at which they felt the same astonishment that all felt on first becoming acquainted with it; and vivaldo , who was a person of great shrewdness and of a lively temperament , in order to beguile the short journey which they said was required to reach the mountain , the scene of the burial , sought to give him an opportunity of going on with his absurdities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so he said to him ,  - it seems to me , seor knight - errant , that your worship has made choice of one of the most austere professions in the world , and i imagine even that of the carthusian monks is not so austere . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as austere it may perhaps be , replied our don quixote ,  - but so necessary for the world i am very much inclined to doubt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for , if the truth is to be told , the soldier who executes what his captain orders does no less than the captain himself who gives the order . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my meaning , is , that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to heaven for the welfare of the world , but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray for , defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our swords , not under shelter but in the open air , a target for the intolerable rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of winter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as the business of war and all that relates and belongs to it cannot be conducted without exceeding great sweat , toil , and exertion , it follows that those who make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquil peace and quiet are engaged in praying to god to help the weak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to be emperors , in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat; and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sages to help them they would have been completely baulked in their ambition and disappointed in their hopes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for all that , answered the traveller ,  - i feel some doubt still , because often i have read how words will arise between two knights - errant , and from one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles and they wheel their horses round and take a good stretch of field , and then without any more ado at the top of their speed they come to the charge , and in mid - career they are wont to commend themselves to their ladies; and what commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the haunches of his horse pierced through and through by his antagonist s lance , and as for the other , it is only by holding on to the mane of his horse that he can help falling to the ground; but i know not how the dead man had time to commend himself to god in the course of such rapid work as this; it would have been better if those words which he spent in commending himself to his lady in the midst of his career had been devoted to his duty and obligation as a christian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , it is my belief that all knights - errant have not ladies to commend themselves to , for they are not all in love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is impossible , said don quixote:  - i say it is impossible that there could be a knight - errant without a lady , because to such it is as natural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most certainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a knight - errant without an amour , and for the simple reason that without one he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard , and one who had gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood , not by the door , but over the wall like a thief and a robber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which our don quixote made answer ,  - sir , one solitary swallow does not make summer; moreover , i know that knight was in secret very deeply in love; besides which , that way of falling in love with all that took his fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , in short , it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistress of his will , to whom he commended himself very frequently and very secretly , for he prided himself on being a reticent knight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then if it be essential that every knight - errant should be in love , said the traveller ,  - it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so , as you are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being as reticent as don galaor , i entreat you as earnestly as i can , in the name of all this company and in my own , to inform us of the name , country , rank , and beauty of your lady , for she will esteem herself fortunate if all the world knows that she is loved and served by such a knight as your worship seems to be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this don quixote heaved a deep sigh and said ,  - i cannot say positively whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world should know i serve her; i can only say in answer to what has been so courteously asked of me , that her name is dulcinea , her country el toboso , a village of la mancha , her rank must be at least that of a princess , since she is my queen and lady , and her beauty superhuman , since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her hairs are gold , her forehead elysian fields , her eyebrows rainbows , her eyes suns , her cheeks roses , her lips coral , her teeth pearls , her neck alabaster , her bosom marble , her hands ivory , her fairness snow , and what modesty conceals from sight such , i think and imagine , as rational reflection can only extol , not compare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we should like to know her lineage , race , and ancestry , said vivaldo . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which don quixote replied ,  - she is not of the ancient roman curtii , caii , or scipios , nor of the modern colonnas or orsini , nor of the moncadas or requesenes of catalonia , nor yet of the rebellas or villanovas of valencia; palafoxes , nuzas , rocabertis , corellas , lunas , alagones , urreas , foces , or gurreas of aragon; cerdas , manriques , mendozas , or guzmans of castile; alencastros , pallas , or meneses of portugal; but she is of those of el toboso of la mancha , a lineage that though modern , may furnish a source of gentle blood for the most illustrious families of the ages that are to come , and this let none dispute with me save on the condition that zerbino placed at the foot of the trophy of orlando s arms , saying ,<s> <s> these let none move who dareth not his might with roland prove . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - although mine is of the cachopins of laredo , said the traveller ,  - i will not venture to compare it with that of el toboso of la mancha , though , to tell the truth , no such surname has until now ever reached my ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote ,  - has that never reached them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the conversation of the pair , and even the very goatherds and shepherds perceived how exceedingly out of his wits our don quixote was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho panza alone thought that what his master said was the truth , knowing who he was and having known him from his birth; and all that he felt any difficulty in believing was that about the fair dulcinea del toboso , because neither any such name nor any such princess had ever come to his knowledge though he lived so close to el toboso . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were going along conversing in this way , when they saw descending a gap between two high mountains some twenty shepherds , all clad in sheepskins of black wool , and crowned with garlands which , as afterwards appeared , were , some of them of yew , some of cypress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> six of the number were carrying a bier covered with a great variety of flowers and branches , on seeing which one of the goatherds said ,  - those who come there are the bearers of chrysostom s body , and the foot of that mountain is the place where he ordered them to bury him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> around him on the bier itself were laid some books , and several papers open and folded; and those who were looking on as well as those who were opening the grave and all the others who were there preserved a strange silence , until one of those who had borne the body said to another ,  - observe carefully , ambrosio if this is the place chrysostom spoke of , since you are anxious that what he directed in his will should be so strictly complied with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is the place , answered ambrosio  - for in it many a time did my poor friend tell me the story of his hard fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here it was , he told me , that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race , and here , too , for the first time he declared to her his passion , as honourable as it was devoted , and here it was that at last marcela ended by scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his wretched life to a close; here , in memory of misfortunes so great , he desired to be laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then turning to don quixote and the travellers he went on to say ,  - that body , sirs , on which you are looking with compassionate eyes , was the abode of a soul on which heaven bestowed a vast share of its riches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their owner himself , said vivaldo ,  - for it is neither right nor proper to do the will of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable; it would not have been reasonable in augustus caesar had he permitted the directions left by the divine mantuan in his will to be carried into effect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so that , seor ambrosio while you consign your friend s body to the earth , you should not consign his writings to oblivion , for if he gave the order in bitterness of heart , it is not right that you should irrationally obey it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on the contrary , by granting life to those papers , let the cruelty of marcela live for ever , to serve as a warning in ages to come to all men to shun and avoid falling into like danger; or i and all of us who have come here know already the story of this your love - stricken and heart - broken friend , and we know , too , your friendship , and the cause of his death , and the directions he gave at the close of his life; from which sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of marcela , the love of chrysostom , and the loyalty of your friendship , together with the end awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that insane passion opens to their eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> last night we learned the death of chrysostom and that he was to be buried here , and out of curiosity and pity we left our direct road and resolved to come and see with our eyes that which when heard of had so moved our compassion , and in consideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we might by condolence , we beg of you , excellent ambrosio , or at least i on my own account entreat you , that instead of burning those papers you allow me to carry away some of them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and without waiting for the shepherd s answer , he stretched out his hand and took up some of those that were nearest to him; seeing which ambrosio said ,  - out of courtesy , seor , i will grant your request as to those you have taken , but it is idle to expect me to abstain from burning the remainder . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> vivaldo , who was eager to see what the papers contained , opened one of them at once , and saw that its title was  - lay of despair . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ambrosio hearing it said ,  - that is the last paper the unhappy man wrote; and that you may see , seor , to what an end his misfortunes brought him , read it so that you may be heard , for you will have time enough for that while we are waiting for the grave to be dug . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will do so very willingly , said vivaldo; and as all the bystanders were equally eager they gathered round him , and he , reading in a loud voice , found that it ran as follows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the  - lay of chrysostom met with the approbation of the listeners , though the reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he had heard of marcela s reserve and propriety , for chrysostom complained in it of jealousy , suspicion , and absence , all to the prejudice of the good name and fame of marcela; to which ambrosio replied as one who knew well his friend s most secret thoughts ,  - seor , to remove that doubt i should tell you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he was away from marcela , from whom he had voluntarily separated himself , to try if absence would act with him as it is wont; and as everything distresses and every fear haunts the banished lover , so imaginary jealousies and suspicions , dreaded as if they were true , tormented chrysostom; and thus the truth of what report declares of the virtue of marcela remains unshaken , and with her envy itself should not and cannot find any fault save that of being cruel , somewhat haughty , and very scornful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> those who had never till then beheld her gazed upon her in wonder and silence , and those who were accustomed to see her were not less amazed than those who had never seen her before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the instant ambrosio saw her he addressed her , with manifest indignation: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - art thou come , by chance , cruel basilisk of these mountains , to see if in thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being thy cruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel work of thy humours that thou art come; or like another pitiless nero to look down from that height upon the ruin of his rome in embers; or in thy arrogance to trample on this ill - fated corpse , as the ungrateful daughter trampled on her father tarquin s? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i come not , ambrosio for any of the purposes thou hast named , replied marcela ,  - but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all those who blame me for their sorrow and for chrysostom s death; and therefore i ask all of you that are here to give me your attention , for it will not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to persons of sense . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> heaven has made me , so you say , beautiful , and so much so that in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and for the love you show me you say , and even urge , that i am bound to love you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by that natural understanding which god has given me i know that everything beautiful attracts love , but i cannot see how , by reason of being loved , that which is loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it; besides , it may happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be ugly , and ugliness being detestable , it is very absurd to say ,  - i love thee because thou art beautiful , thou must love me though i be ugly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but supposing the beauty equal on both sides , it does not follow that the inclinations must be therefore alike , for it is not every beauty that excites love , some but pleasing the eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of beauty excited love and won the heart , the will would wander vaguely to and fro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity of beautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations , and true love , i have heard it said , is indivisible , and must be voluntary and not compelled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if this be so , as i believe it to be , why do you desire me to bend my will by force , for no other reason but that you say you love me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> naytell mehad heaven made me ugly , as it has made me beautiful , could i with justice complain of you for not loving me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , you must remember that the beauty i possess was no choice of mine , for , be it what it may , heaven of its bounty gave it me without my asking or choosing it; and as the viper , though it kills with it , does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries , as it is a gift of nature , neither do i deserve reproach for being beautiful; for beauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword; the one does not burn , the other does not cut , those who do not come too near . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind , without which the body , though it be so , has no right to pass for beautiful; but if modesty is one of the virtues that specially lend a grace and charm to mind and body , why should she who is loved for her beauty part with it to gratify one who for his pleasure alone strives with all his might and energy to rob her of it? </s> </s>

<s> <s> chance , however , and the devil , who is not always asleep , so ordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove of galician ponies belonging to certain yanguesan carriers , whose way it is to take their midday rest with their teams in places and spots where grass and water abound; and that where don quixote chanced to be suited the yanguesans  purpose very well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by this time don quixote and sancho , who had witnessed the drubbing of rocinante , came up panting , and said don quixote to sancho: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so far as i can see , friend sancho , these are not knights but base folk of low birth: i mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in taking due vengeance for the insult offered to rocinante before our eyes . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the yanguesans , seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were so many , betook themselves to their stakes , and driving the two into the middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact , at the second blow they brought sancho to the ground , and don quixote fared the same way , all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing , and fate willed it that he should fall at the feet of rocinante , who had not yet risen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry boorish hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho was the first to come to , and finding himself close to his master he called to him in a weak and doleful voice ,  - seor don quixote , ah , seor don quixote! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what wouldst thou , brother sancho? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> answered don quixote in the same feeble suffering tone as sancho . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if i only had it here , wretch that i am , what more should we want? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - but in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our feet? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> answered sancho panza . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is that when thou shalt see rabble of this sort offering us insult thou art not to wait till i draw sword against them , for i shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastise them to thy heart s content , and if any knights come to their aid and defence i will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my might; and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs and proofs what the might of this strong arm of mine is equal toso uplifted had the poor gentleman become through the victory over the stout biscayan . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but sancho did not so fully approve of his master s admonition as to let it pass without saying in reply ,  - seor , i am a man of peace , meek and quiet , and i can put up with any affront because i have a wife and children to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your worship , as it cannot be a mandate , that on no account will i draw sword either against clown or against knight , and that here before god i forgive the insults that have been offered me , whether they have been , are , or shall be offered me by high or low , rich or poor , noble or commoner , not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come now , sinner , suppose the wind of fortune , hitherto so adverse , should turn in our favour , filling the sails of our desires so that safely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those islands i have promised thee , how would it be with thee if on winning it i made thee lord of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why , thou wilt make it well - nigh impossible through not being a knight nor having any desire to be one , nor possessing the courage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thy lordship; for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their making some move to change matters once more , and try , as they say , what chance may do for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should have good sense to enable him to govern , and valour to attack and defend himself , whatever may befall him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> after all , they say right that it takes a long time to come to know people , and that there is nothing sure in this life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who would have said that , after such mighty slashes as your worship gave that unlucky knight - errant , there was coming , travelling post and at the very heels of them , such a great storm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - know , friend sancho , answered don quixote ,  - that the life of knights - errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses , and neither more nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights - errant to become kings and emperors , as experience has shown in the case of many different knights with whose histories i am thoroughly acquainted; and i could tell thee now , if the pain would let me , of some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations i have mentioned; and those same , both before and after , experienced divers misfortunes and miseries; for the valiant amadis of gaul found himself in the power of his mortal enemy arcalaus the magician , who , it is positively asserted , holding him captive , gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied to one of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of no small authority who says that the knight of phoebus , being caught in a certain pitfall , which opened under his feet in a certain castle , on falling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground , where they administered to him one of those things they call clysters , of sand and snow - water , that well - nigh finished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage , a great friend of his , it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so i may well suffer in company with such worthy folk , for greater were the indignities which they had to suffer than those which we suffer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for i would have thee know , sancho , that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity , and this is laid down in the law of the duel in express words: if , for instance , the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has in his hand , though it be in fact a piece of wood , it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he struck with it has been cudgelled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they gave me no time to see that much , answered sancho ,  - for hardly had i laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out of my feet , stretching me where i now lie , and where thinking of whether all those stake - strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness , which the pain of the blows does , for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for all that let me tell thee , brother panza , said don quixote ,  - that there is no recollection which time does not put an end to , and no pain which death does not remove . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what greater misfortune can there be , replied panza ,  - than the one that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is nothing wonderful in that , replied sancho ,  - since he is a knight - errant too; what i wonder at is that my beast should have come off scot - free where we come out scotched . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and moreover i shall not hold it any dishonour to be so mounted , for i remember having read how the good old silenus , the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter , when he entered the city of the hundred gates , went very contentedly mounted on a handsome ass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it may be true that he went mounted as your worship says , answered sancho ,  - but there is a great difference between going mounted and going slung like a sack of manure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is , said don quixote ,  - when they cannot help it , or when they are in love; and so true is this that there have been knights who have remained two years on rocks , in sunshine and shade and all the inclemencies of heaven , without their ladies knowing anything of it; and one of these was amadis , when , under the name of beltenebros , he took up his abode on the pena pobre fori know not if it was eight years or eight months , for i am not very sure of the reckoning; at any rate he stayed there doing penance for i know not what pique the princess oriana had against him; but no more of this now , sancho , and make haste before a mishap like rocinante s befalls the ass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the innkeeper , seeing don quixote slung across the ass , asked sancho what was amiss with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho answered that it was nothing , only that he had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the innkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonly have , for she was by nature kind - hearted and felt for the sufferings of her neighbours , so she at once set about tending don quixote , and made her young daughter , a very comely girl , help her in taking care of her guest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was besides in the inn , as servant , an asturian lass with a broad face , flat poll , and snub nose , blind of one eye and not very sound in the other . </s> </s>

<s> <s> this graceful lass , then , helped the young girl , and the two made up a very bad bed for don quixote in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served for many years as a straw - loft , in which there was also quartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our don quixote s , and , though only made of the pack - saddles and cloths of his mules , had much the advantage of it , as don quixote s consisted simply of four rough boards on two not very even trestles , a mattress , that for thinness might have passed for a quilt , full of pellets which , were they not seen through the rents to be wool , would to the touch have seemed pebbles in hardness , two sheets made of buckler leather , and a coverlet the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without missing one in the reckoning . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that may well be , said the young girl ,  - for it has many a time happened to me to dream that i was falling down from a tower and never coming to the ground , and when i awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken as if i had really fallen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is the point , seora , replied sancho panza ,  - that i without dreaming at all , but being more awake than i am now , find myself with scarcely less wheals than my master , don quixote . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it is too soon yet , answered sancho ,  - for we have only been a month going in quest of adventures , and so far we have met with nothing that can be called one , for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found; however , if my master don quixote gets well of this wound , or fall , and i am left none the worse of it , i would not change my hopes for the best title in spain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to all this conversation don quixote was listening very attentively , and sitting up in bed as well as he could , and taking the hostess by the hand he said to her ,  - believe me , fair lady , you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person , which is such that if i do not myself praise it , it is because of what is commonly said , that self - praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you who i am . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hostess , her daughter , and the worthy maritornes listened in bewilderment to the words of the knight - errant; for they understood about as much of them as if he had been talking greek , though they could perceive they were all meant for expressions of good - will and blandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language , they stared at him and wondered to themselves , for he seemed to them a man of a different sort from those they were used to , and thanking him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him , while the asturian gave her attention to sancho , who needed it no less than his master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night , and she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the family asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hard , narrow , wretched , rickety bed of don quixote stood first in the middle of this star - lit stable , and close beside it sancho made his , which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas rather than of wool . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a thousand blessings on the author of  - tablante de ricamonte and that of the other book in which the deeds of the conde tomillas are recounted; with what minuteness they describe everything! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this strange stillness , and the thoughts , always present to our knight s mind , of the incidents described at every turn in the books that were the cause of his misfortune , conjured up to his imagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived , which was that he fancied himself to have reached a famous castle ( for , as has been said , all the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes ) , and that the daughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle , and that she , won by his high - bred bearing , had fallen in love with him , and had promised to come to his bed for a while that night without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that he had constructed as solid fact , he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilous risk which his virtue was about to encounter , and he resolved in his heart to commit no treason to his lady dulcinea del toboso , even though the queen guinevere herself and the dame quintanona should present themselves before him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while he was taken up with these vagaries , then , the time and the houran unlucky one for himarrived for the asturian to come , who in her smock , with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif , with noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three were quartered , in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she gained the door when don quixote perceived her , and sitting up in his bed in spite of his plasters and the pain of his ribs , he stretched out his arms to receive his beauteous damsel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the asturian , who went all doubled up and in silence with her hands before her feeling for her lover , encountered the arms of don quixote , who grasped her tightly by the wrist , and drawing her towards him , while she dared not utter a word , made her sit down on the bed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then felt her smock , and although it was of sackcloth it appeared to him to be of the finest and softest silk: on her wrists she wore some glass beads , but to him they had the sheen of precious orient pearls: her hair , which in some measure resembled a horse s mane , he rated as threads of the brightest gold of araby , whose refulgence dimmed the sun himself: her breath , which no doubt smelt of yesterday s stale salad , seemed to him to diffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth; and , in short , he drew her portrait in his imagination with the same features and in the same style as that which he had seen in his books of the other princesses who , smitten by love , came with all the adornments that are here set down , to see the sorely wounded knight; and so great was the poor gentleman s blindness that neither touch , nor smell , nor anything else about the good lass that would have made any but a carrier vomit , were enough to undeceive him; on the contrary , he was persuaded he had the goddess of beauty in his arms , and holding her firmly in his grasp he went on to say in low , tender voice: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - would that i found myself , lovely and exalted lady , in a position to repay such a favour as that which you , by the sight of your great beauty , have granted me; but fortune , which is never weary of persecuting the good , has chosen to place me upon this bed , where i lie so bruised and broken that though my inclination would gladly comply with yours it is impossible; besides , to this impossibility another yet greater is to be added , which is the faith that i have pledged to the peerless dulcinea del toboso , sole lady of my most secret thoughts; and were it not that this stood in the way i should not be so insensible a knight as to miss the happy opportunity which your great goodness has offered me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast by don quixote , and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed to her , she strove without speaking to free herself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the worthy carrier , whose unholy thoughts kept him awake , was aware of his doxy the moment she entered the door , and was listening attentively to all don quixote said; and jealous that the asturian should have broken her word with him for another , drew nearer to don quixote s bed and stood still to see what would come of this talk which he could not understand; but when he perceived the wench struggling to get free and don quixote striving to hold her , not relishing the joke he raised his arm and delivered such a terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight that he bathed all his mouth in blood , and not content with this he mounted on his ribs and with his feet tramped all over them at a pace rather smarter than a trot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bed which was somewhat crazy and not very firm on its feet , unable to support the additional weight of the carrier , came to the ground , and at the mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it must be some brawl of maritornes  , because after calling loudly to her he got no answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this suspicion he got up , and lighting a lamp hastened to the quarter where he had heard the disturbance . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and so , as the saying is , cat to rat , rat to rope , rope to stick , the carrier pounded sancho , sancho the lass , she him , and the innkeeper her , and all worked away so briskly that they did not give themselves a moment s rest; and the best of it was that the innkeeper s lamp went out , and as they were left in the dark they all laid on one upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a sound spot left where a hand could light . </s> </s>

<s> <s> unlucky me and the mother that bore me! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - that is the truth , answered don quixote ,  - and there is no use in troubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or vexed at them , for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no one on whom to avenge ourselves , do what we may; rise , sancho , if thou canst , and call the alcaide of this fortress , and get him to give me a little oil , wine , salt , and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam , for indeed i believe i have great need of it now , because i am losing much blood from the wound that phantom gave me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho got up with pain enough in his bones , and went after the innkeeper in the dark , and meeting the officer , who was looking to see what had become of his enemy , he said to him ,  - seor , whoever you are , do us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary , oil , salt , and wine , for it is wanted to cure one of the best knights - errant on earth , who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted moor that is in this inn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the officer heard him talk in this way , he took him for a man out of his senses , and as day was now beginning to break , he opened the inn gate , and calling the host , he told him what this good man wanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the host furnished him with what he required , and sancho brought it to don quixote , who , with his hand to his head , was bewailing the pain of the blow of the lamp , which had done him no more harm than raising a couple of rather large lumps , and what he fancied blood was only the sweat that flowed from him in his sufferings during the late storm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this being accomplished , he felt anxious to make trial himself , on the spot , of the virtue of this precious balsam , as he considered it , and so he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and remained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had he done drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was left in his stomach , and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke into a profuse sweat , on account of which he bade them cover him up and leave him alone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did so , and he lay sleeping more than three hours , at the end of which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief and so much ease from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured , and verily believed he had hit upon the balsam of fierabras; and that with this remedy he might thenceforward , without any fear , face any kind of destruction , battle , or combat , however perilous it might be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote consented , and he , taking it with both hands , in good faith and with a better will , gulped down and drained off very little less than his master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the fact is , that the stomach of poor sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his master , and so , before vomiting , he was seized with such gripings and retchings , and such sweats and faintness , that verily and truly he believed his last hour had come , and finding himself so racked and tormented he cursed the balsam and the thief that had given it to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote seeing him in this state said ,  - it is my belief , sancho , that this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight , for i am persuaded this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if your worship knew that , returned sancho - woe betide me and all my kindred! why did you let me taste it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment the draught took effect , and the poor squire began to discharge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had thrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for nothing afterwards . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the ill - luck of the unfortunate sancho so ordered it that among the company in the inn there were four woolcarders from segovia , three needle - makers from the colt of cordova , and two lodgers from the fair of seville , lively fellows , tender - hearted , fond of a joke , and playful , who , almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse , made up to sancho and dismounted him from his ass , while one of them went in for the blanket of the host s bed; but on flinging him into it they looked up , and seeing that the ceiling was somewhat lower than what they required for their work , they decided upon going out into the yard , which was bounded by the sky , and there , putting sancho in the middle of the blanket , they began to raise him high , making sport with him as they would with a dog at shrovetide . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> wheeling about he came up to the inn with a laborious gallop , and finding it shut went round it to see if he could find some way of getting in; but as soon as he came to the wall of the yard , which was not very high , he discovered the game that was being played with his squire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that , had his rage allowed him , it is my belief he would have laughed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he tried to climb from his horse on to the top of the wall , but he was so bruised and battered that he could not even dismount; and so from the back of his horse he began to utter such maledictions and objurgations against those who were blanketing sancho as it would be impossible to write down accurately: they , however , did not stay their laughter or their work for this , nor did the flying sancho cease his lamentations , mingled now with threats , now with entreaties but all to little purpose , or none at all , until from pure weariness they left off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they then brought him his ass , and mounting him on top of it they put his jacket round him; and the compassionate maritornes , seeing him so exhausted , thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water , and that it might be all the cooler she fetched it from the well . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho took it , and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming ,  - sancho , my son , drink not water; drink it not , my son , for it will kill thee; see , here i have the blessed balsam ( and he held up the flask of liquor ) , and with drinking two drops of it thou wilt certainly be restored . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at these words sancho turned his eyes asquint , and in a still louder voice said ,  - can it be your worship has forgotten that i am not a knight , or do you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels i have left after last night? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> keep your liquor in the name of all the devils , and leave me to myself! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and at one and the same instant he left off talking and began drinking; but as at the first sup he perceived it was water he did not care to go on with it , and begged maritornes to fetch him some wine , which she did with right good will , and paid for it with her own money; for indeed they say of her that , though she was in that line of life , there was some faint and distant resemblance to a christian about her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when sancho had done drinking he dug his heels into his ass , and the gate of the inn being thrown open he passed out very well pleased at having paid nothing and carried his point , though it had been at the expense of his usual sureties , his shoulders . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the innkeeper , as soon as he saw him off , wanted to bar the gate close , but the blanketers would not agree to it , for they were fellows who would not have cared two farthings for don quixote , even had he been really one of the knights - errant of the round table . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge on his beast . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and i hold this confirmed by having noticed that when i was by the wall of the yard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy , it was out of my power to mount upon it , nor could i even dismount from rocinante , because they no doubt had me enchanted; for i swear to thee by the faith of what i am that if i had been able to climb up or dismount , i would have avenged thee in such a way that those braggart thieves would have remembered their freak for ever , even though in so doing i knew that i contravened the laws of chivalry , which , as i have often told thee , do not permit a knight to lay hands on him who is not one , save in case of urgent and great necessity in defence of his own life and person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how little thou knowest about chivalry , sancho , replied don quixote;  - hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shalt see with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in the pursuit of this calling; nay , tell me , what greater pleasure can there be in the world , or what delight can equal that of winning a battle , and triumphing over one s enemy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> none , beyond all doubt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very likely , answered sancho ,  - though i do not know it; all i know is that since we have been knights - errant , or since your worship has been one ( for i have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a number ) we have never won any battle except the one with the biscayan , and even out of that your worship came with half an ear and half a helmet the less; and from that till now it has been all cudgellings and more cudgellings , cuffs and more cuffs , i getting the blanketing over and above , and falling in with enchanted persons on whom i cannot avenge myself so as to know what the delight , as your worship calls it , of conquering an enemy is like . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is what vexes me , and what ought to vex thee , sancho , replied don quixote;  - but henceforward i will endeavour to have at hand some sword made by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effect upon him who carries it , and it is even possible that fortune may procure for me that which belonged to amadis when he was called the knight of the burning sword ,  which was one of the best swords that ever knight in the world possessed , for , besides having the said virtue , it cut like a razor , and there was no armour , however strong and enchanted it might be , that could resist it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - fear not that , sancho , said don quixote:  - heaven will deal better by thee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus talking , don quixote and his squire were going along , when , on the road they were following , don quixote perceived approaching them a large and thick cloud of dust , on seeing which he turned to sancho and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this is the day , sancho , on which will be seen the boon my fortune is reserving for me; this , i say , is the day on which as much as on any other shall be displayed the might of my arm , and on which i shall do deeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seest thou that cloud of dust which rises yonder? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - according to that there must be two , said sancho ,  - for on this opposite side also there rises just such another cloud of dust . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote turned to look and found that it was true , and rejoicing exceedingly , he concluded that they were two armies about to engage and encounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times and seasons his fancy was full of the battles , enchantments , adventures , crazy feats , loves , and defiances that are recorded in the books of chivalry , and everything he said , thought , or did had reference to such things . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote:  - give aid and assistance to the weak and those who need it; and thou must know , sancho , that this which comes opposite to us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor alifanfaron , lord of the great isle of trapobana; this other that marches behind me is that of his enemy the king of the garamantas , pentapolin of the bare arm , for he always goes into battle with his right arm bare . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they are at enmity , replied don quixote ,  - because this alifanfaron is a furious pagan and is in love with the daughter of pentapolin , who is a very beautiful and moreover gracious lady , and a christian , and her father is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first abandons the religion of his false prophet mahomet , and adopts his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in that thou wilt do what is thy duty , sancho , said don quixote;  - for to engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed knight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that i can well understand , answered sancho;  - but where shall we put this ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for i believe it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of this kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but attend to me and observe , for i wish to give thee some account of the chief knights who accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better see and mark , let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder , whence both armies may be seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did so , and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the two droves that don quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen if the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the sight; nevertheless , seeing in his imagination what he did not see and what did not exist , he began thus in a loud voice: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but turn thine eyes to the other side , and thou shalt see in front and in the van of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished timonel of carcajona , prince of new biscay , who comes in armour with arms quartered azure , vert , white , and yellow , and bears on his shield a cat or on a field tawny with a motto which says miau , which is the beginning of the name of his lady , who according to report is the peerless miaulina , daughter of the duke alfeniquen of the algarve; the other , who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger and bears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device , is a novice knight , a frenchman by birth , pierres papin by name , lord of the baronies of utrique; that other , who with iron - shod heels strikes the flanks of that nimble parti - coloured zebra , and for arms bears azure vair , is the mighty duke of nerbia , espartafilardo del bosque , who bears for device on his shield an asparagus plant with a motto in castilian that says , rastrea mi suerte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so he went on naming a number of knights of one squadron or the other out of his imagination , and to all he assigned off - hand their arms , colours , devices , and mottoes , carried away by the illusions of his unheard - of craze; and without a pause , he continued ,  - people of divers nations compose this squadron in front; here are those that drink of the sweet waters of the famous xanthus , those that scour the woody massilian plains , those that sift the pure fine gold of arabia felix , those that enjoy the famed cool banks of the crystal thermodon , those that in many and various ways divert the streams of the golden pactolus , the numidians , faithless in their promises , the persians renowned in archery , the parthians and the medes that fight as they fly , the arabs that ever shift their dwellings , the scythians as cruel as they are fair , the ethiopians with pierced lips , and an infinity of other nations whose features i recognise and descry , though i cannot recall their names . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal streams of the olive - bearing betis , those that make smooth their countenances with the water of the ever rich and golden tagus , those that rejoice in the fertilising flow of the divine genil , those that roam the tartesian plains abounding in pasture , those that take their pleasure in the elysian meadows of jerez , the rich manchegans crowned with ruddy ears of corn , the wearers of iron , old relics of the gothic race , those that bathe in the pisuerga renowned for its gentle current , those that feed their herds along the spreading pastures of the winding guadiana famed for its hidden course , those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad pyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty apennine; in a word , as many as all europe includes and contains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what a number of countries and nations he named! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giving to each its proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful and saturated with what he had read in his lying books! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - seor , devil take it if there s a sign of any man you talk of , knight or giant , in the whole thing; maybe it s all enchantment , like the phantoms last night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how canst thou say that! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep , said sancho; which was true , for by this time the two flocks had come close . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the fear thou art in , sancho , said don quixote ,  - prevents thee from seeing or hearing correctly , for one of the effects of fear is to derange the senses and make things appear different from what they are; if thou art in such fear , withdraw to one side and leave me to myself , for alone i suffice to bring victory to that side to which i shall give my aid; and so saying he gave rocinante the spur , and putting the lance in rest , shot down the slope like a thunderbolt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho shouted after him , crying ,  - come back , seor don quixote; i vow to god they are sheep and ewes you are charging! </s> </s>

<s> <s> what are you about? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but not for all these entreaties did don quixote turn back; on the contrary he went on shouting out ,  - ho , knights , ye who follow and fight under the banners of the valiant emperor pentapolin of the bare arm , follow me all; ye shall see how easily i shall give him his revenge over his enemy alifanfaron of the trapobana . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so saying , he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes , and began spearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he were transfixing mortal enemies in earnest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> come before me; i am a single knight who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand , and make thee yield thy life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant pentapolin garamanta . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here came a sugar - plum from the brook that struck him on the side and buried a couple of ribs in his body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> feeling himself so smitten , he imagined himself slain or badly wounded for certain , and recollecting his liquor he drew out his flask , and putting it to his mouth began to pour the contents into his stomach; but ere he had succeeded in swallowing what seemed to him enough , there came another almond which struck him on the hand and on the flask so fairly that it smashed it to pieces , knocking three or four teeth and grinders out of his mouth in its course , and sorely crushing two fingers of his hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such was the force of the first blow and of the second , that the poor knight in spite of himself came down backwards off his horse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this time sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats his master was performing , and tearing his beard and cursing the hour and the occasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did i not tell you to come back , seor don quixote; and that what you were going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at any rate , do this much , i beg of thee , sancho , to undeceive thyself , and see that what i say is true; mount thy ass and follow them quietly , and thou shalt see that when they have gone some little distance from this they will return to their original shape and , ceasing to be sheep , become men in all respects as i described them to thee at first . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but go not just yet , for i want thy help and assistance; come hither , and see how many of my teeth and grinders are missing , for i feel as if there was not one left in my mouth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - holy mary! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried sancho ,  - what is this that has happened me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> clearly this sinner is mortally wounded , as he vomits blood from the mouth; but considering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the colour , taste , and smell , that it was not blood but the balsam from the flask which he had seen him drink; and he was taken with such a loathing that his stomach turned , and he vomited up his inside over his very master , and both were left in a precious state . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho ran to his ass to get something wherewith to clean himself , and relieve his master , out of his alforjas; but not finding them , he well - nigh took leave of his senses , and cursed himself anew , and in his heart resolved to quit his master and return home , even though he forfeited the wages of his service and all hopes of the promised island . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote now rose , and putting his left hand to his mouth to keep his teeth from falling out altogether , with the other he laid hold of the bridle of rocinante , who had never stirred from his master s sideso loyal and well - behaved was heand betook himself to where the squire stood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek , like one in deep dejection . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing him in this mood , looking so sad , don quixote said to him: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - bear in mind , sancho , that one man is no more than another , unless he does more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signs that fair weather is coming shortly , and that things will go well with us , for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence it follows that the evil having lasted long , the good must be now nigh at hand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which happen to me , since thou hast no share in them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how have i not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied sancho;  - was he whom they blanketed yesterday perchance any other than my father s son? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and the alforjas that are missing to - day with all my treasures , did they belong to any other but myself? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> are the alforjas missing , sancho? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , they are missing , answered sancho . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in that case we have nothing to eat to - day , replied don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it would be so , answered sancho ,  - if there were none of the herbs your worship says you know in these meadows , those with which knights - errant as unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such - like shortcomings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for all that , answered don quixote ,  - i would rather have just now a quarter of bread , or a loaf and a couple of pilchards  heads , than all the herbs described by dioscorides , even with doctor laguna s notes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - knights - errant knew and ought to know everything , sancho , said don quixote;  - for there were knights - errant in former times as well qualified to deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an encampment , as if they had graduated in the university of paris; whereby we may see that the lance has never blunted the pen , nor the pen the lance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , be it as your worship says , replied sancho;  - let us be off now and find some place of shelter for the night , and god grant it may be somewhere where there are no blankets , nor blanketeers , nor phantoms , nor enchanted moors; for if there are , may the devil take the whole concern . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - ask that of god , my son , said don quixote; and do thou lead on where thou wilt , for this time i leave our lodging to thy choice; but reach me here thy hand , and feel with thy finger , and find out how many of my teeth and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw , for it is there i feel the pain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho put in his fingers , and feeling about asked him ,  - how many grinders used your worship have on this side? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - four , replied don quixote ,  - besides the back - tooth , all whole and quite sound . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mind what you are saying , seor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i say four , if not five , answered don quixote ,  - for never in my life have i had tooth or grinder drawn , nor has any fallen out or been destroyed by any decay or rheum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , said sancho ,  - in this lower side your worship has no more than two grinders and a half , and in the upper neither a half nor any at all , for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - luckless that i am! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote , hearing the sad news his squire gave him;  - i had rather they despoiled me of an arm , so it were not the sword - arm; for i tell thee , sancho , a mouth without teeth is like a mill without a millstone , and a tooth is much more to be prized than a diamond; but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to all this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> mount , friend , and lead the way , and i will follow thee at whatever pace thou wilt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho did as he bade him , and proceeded in the direction in which he thought he might find refuge without quitting the high road , which was there very much frequented . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they went along , then , at a slow pacefor the pain in don quixote s jaws kept him uneasy and ill - disposed for speedsancho thought it well to amuse and divert him by talk of some kind , and among the things he said to him was that which will be told in the following chapter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems to me , seor , that all these mishaps that have befallen us of late have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committed by your worship against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath you made not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen , and all the rest of it that your worship swore to observe until you had taken that helmet of malandrino s , or whatever the moor is called , for i do not very well remember . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have i taken an oath of some sort , then? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sancho . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath , said don quixote;  - suffice it that i see thou art not quite clear of complicity; and whether or no , it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a remedy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while engaged in this and other talk , night overtook them on the road before they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and what made it still worse was that they were dying of hunger , for with the loss of the alforjas they had lost their entire larder and commissariat; and to complete the misfortune they met with an adventure which without any invention had really the appearance of one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it so happened that the night closed in somewhat darkly , but for all that they pushed on , sancho feeling sure that as the road was the king s highway they might reasonably expect to find some inn within a league or two . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> going along , then , in this way , the night dark , the squire hungry , the master sharp - set , they saw coming towards them on the road they were travelling a great number of lights which looked exactly like stars in motion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this , no doubt , sancho , will be a most mighty and perilous adventure , in which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and resolution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - unlucky me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be they phantoms ever so much , said don quixote ,  - i will not permit them to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with thee the time before , it was because i was unable to leap the walls of the yard; but now we are on a wide plain , where i shall be able to wield my sword as i please . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time , said sancho ,  - what difference will it make being on the open plain or not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for all that , replied don quixote ,  - i entreat thee , sancho , to keep a good heart , for experience will tell thee what mine is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will , please god , answered sancho , and the two retiring to one side of the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving lights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty encamisados , all on horseback , with lighted torches in their hands , the awe - inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of sancho , who began to chatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit of an ague; and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more when they perceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter covered over with black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourning down to the very feet of their mulesfor they could perceive plainly they were not horses by the easy pace at which they went . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary place was quite enough to strike terror into sancho s heart , and even into his master s; and ( save in don quixote s case ) did so , for all sancho s resolution had now broken down . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was just the opposite with his master , whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to him vividly as one of the adventures of his books . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne some sorely wounded or slain knight , to avenge whom was a task reserved for him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in rest , fixed himself firmly in his saddle , and with gallant spirit and bearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the encamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near at hand he raised his voice and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - halt , knights , or whosoever ye may be , and render me account of who ye are , whence ye come , where ye go , what it is ye carry upon that bier , for , to judge by appearances , either ye have done some wrong or some wrong has been done to you , and it is fitting and necessary that i should know , either that i may chastise you for the evil ye have done , or else that i may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted upon you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mule was shy , and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that rearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> an attendant who was on foot , seeing the encamisado fall , began to abuse don quixote , who now moved to anger , without any more ado , laying his lance in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly wounded to the ground , and as he wheeled round upon the others the agility with which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see , for it seemed just as if wings had that instant grown upon rocinante , so lightly and proudly did he bear himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the encamisados were all timid folk and unarmed , so they speedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a run across the plain with their lighted torches , looking exactly like maskers running on some gala or festival night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the mourners , too , enveloped and swathed in their skirts and gowns , were unable to bestir themselves , and so with entire safety to himself don quixote belaboured them all and drove them off against their will , for they all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to carry away the dead body they had in the litter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had thrown , by the light of which don quixote perceived him , and coming up to him he presented the point of the lance to his face , calling on him to yield himself prisoner , or else he would kill him; to which the prostrate man replied ,  - i am prisoner enough as it is; i cannot stir , for one of my legs is broken: i entreat you , if you be a christian gentleman , not to kill me , which will be committing grave sacrilege , for i am a licentiate and i hold first orders . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it cannot be , seor , but that this grass is a proof that there must be hard by some spring or brook to give it moisture , so it would be well to move a little farther on , that we may find some place where we may quench this terrible thirst that plagues us , which beyond a doubt is more distressing than hunger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the advice seemed good to don quixote , and , he leading rocinante by the bridle and sancho the ass by the halter , after he had packed away upon him the remains of the supper , they advanced the meadow feeling their way , for the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything; but they had not gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water , as if falling from great rocks , struck their ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the night was , as has been said , dark , and they had happened to reach a spot in among some tall trees , whose leaves stirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound; so that , what with the solitude , the place , the darkness , the noise of the water , and the rustling of the leaves , everything inspired awe and dread; more especially as they perceived that the strokes did not cease , nor the wind lull , nor morning approach; to all which might be added their ignorance as to where they were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but don quixote , supported by his intrepid heart , leaped on rocinante , and bracing his buckler on his arm , brought his pike to the slope , and said ,  - friend sancho , know that i by heaven s will have been born in this our iron age to revive in it the age of gold , or the golden as it is called; i am he for whom perils , mighty achievements , and valiant deeds are reserved; i am , i say again , he who is to revive the knights of the round table , the twelve of france and the nine worthies; and he who is to consign to oblivion the platirs , the tablantes , the olivantes and tirantes , the phoebuses and belianises , with the whole herd of famous knights - errant of days gone by , performing in these in which i live such exploits , marvels , and feats of arms as shall obscure their brightest deeds . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thou dost mark well , faithful and trusty squire , the gloom of this night , its strange silence , the dull confused murmur of those trees , the awful sound of that water in quest of which we came , that seems as though it were precipitating and dashing itself down from the lofty mountains of the moon , and that incessant hammering that wounds and pains our ears; which things all together and each of itself are enough to instil fear , dread , and dismay into the breast of mars himself , much more into one not used to hazards and adventures of the kind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> well , then , all this that i put before thee is but an incentive and stimulant to my spirit , making my heart burst in my bosom through eagerness to engage in this adventure , arduous as it promises to be; therefore tighten rocinante s girths a little , and god be with thee; wait for me here three days and no more , and if in that time i come not back , thou canst return to our village , and thence , to do me a favour and a service , thou wilt go to el toboso , where thou shalt say to my incomparable lady dulcinea that her captive knight hath died in attempting things that might make him worthy of being called hers . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - let it want what it may , replied don quixote ,  - it shall not be said of me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from doing what was in accordance with knightly usage; and so i beg of thee , sancho , to hold thy peace , for god , who has put it into my heart to undertake now this so unexampled and terrible adventure , will take care to watch over my safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do is to tighten rocinante s girths well , and wait here , for i shall come back shortly , alive or dead . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - how can that be? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote;  - is it so essential to the story to know to a nicety the goats that have crossed over , that if there be a mistake of one in the reckoning , thou canst not go on with it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , seor , not a bit , replied sancho;  - for when i asked your worship to tell me how many goats had crossed , and you answered you did not know , at that very instant all i had to say passed away out of my memory , and , faith , there was much virtue in it , and entertainment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , then , said don quixote ,  - the story has come to an end? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as much as my mother has , said sancho . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all that may be , replied sancho ,  - but i know that as to my story , all that can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count of the passage of the goats begins . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let it end where it will , well and good , said don quixote ,  - and let us see if rocinante can go; and again he spurred him , and again rocinante made jumps and remained where he was , so well tied was he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> just then , whether it was the cold of the morning that was now approaching , or that he had eaten something laxative at supper , or that it was only natural ( as is most likely ) , sancho felt a desire to do what no one could do for him; but so great was the fear that had penetrated his heart , he dared not separate himself from his master by as much as the black of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was , however , also impossible; so what he did for peace s sake was to remove his right hand , which held the back of the saddle , and with it to untie gently and silently the running string which alone held up his breeches , so that on loosening it they at once fell down round his feet like fetters; he then raised his shirt as well as he could and bared his hind quarters , no slim ones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , this accomplished , which he fancied was all he had to do to get out of this terrible strait and embarrassment , another still greater difficulty presented itself , for it seemed to him impossible to relieve himself without making some noise , and he ground his teeth and squeezed his shoulders together , holding his breath as much as he could; but in spite of his precautions he was unlucky enough after all to make a little noise , very different from that which was causing him so much fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote , hearing it , said ,  - what noise is that , sancho? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t know , seor , said he;  - it must be something new , for adventures and misadventures never begin with a trifle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as don quixote s sense of smell was as acute as his hearing , and as sancho was so closely linked with him that the fumes rose almost in a straight line , it could not be but that some should reach his nose , and as soon as they did he came to its relief by compressing it between his fingers , saying in a rather snuffing tone ,  - sancho , it strikes me thou art in great fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - because just now thou smellest stronger than ever , and not of ambergris , answered don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - very likely , said sancho ,  - but that s not my fault , but your worship s , for leading me about at unseasonable hours and at such unwonted paces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then go back three or four , my friend , said don quixote , all the time with his fingers to his nose;  - and for the future pay more attention to thy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great familiarity with thee that has bred this contempt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i ll bet , replied sancho ,  - that your worship thinks i have done something i ought not with my person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it makes it worse to stir it , friend sancho , returned don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by this time day had fully broken and everything showed distinctly , and don quixote saw that he was among some tall trees , chestnuts , which cast a very deep shade; he perceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease , but could not discover what caused it , and so without any further delay he let rocinante feel the spur , and once more taking leave of sancho , he told him to wait for him there three days at most , as he had said before , and if he should not have returned by that time , he might feel sure it had been god s will that he should end his days in that perilous adventure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he again repeated the message and commission with which he was to go on his behalf to his lady dulcinea , and said he was not to be uneasy as to the payment of his services , for before leaving home he had made his will , in which he would find himself fully recompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to the time he had served; but if god delivered him safe , sound , and unhurt out of that danger , he might look upon the promised island as much more than certain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho began to weep afresh on again hearing the affecting words of his good master , and resolved to stay with him until the final issue and end of the business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from these tears and this honourable resolve of sancho panza s the author of this history infers that he must have been of good birth and at least an old christian; and the feeling he displayed touched his but not so much as to make him show any weakness; on the contrary , hiding what he felt as well as he could , he began to move towards that quarter whence the sound of the water and of the strokes seemed to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the foot of the rocks were some rudely constructed houses looking more like ruins than houses , from among which came , they perceived , the din and clatter of blows , which still continued without intermission . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> rocinante took fright at the noise of the water and of the blows , but quieting him don quixote advanced step by step towards the houses , commending himself with all his heart to his lady , imploring her support in that dread pass and enterprise , and on the way commending himself to god , too , not to forget him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote , then , seeing that sancho was turning him into ridicule , was so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two such blows that if , instead of catching them on his shoulders , he had caught them on his head there would have been no wages to pay , unless indeed to his heirs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward return in earnest for his jest , and fearing his master might carry it still further , said to him very humbly ,  - calm yourself , sir , for by god i am only joking . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , then , if you are joking i am not , replied don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look here , my lively gentleman , if these , instead of being fulling hammers , had been some perilous adventure , have i not , think you , shown the courage required for the attempt and achievement? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> am i , perchance , being , as i am , a gentleman , bound to know and distinguish sounds and tell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that , when perhaps , as is the case , i have never in my life seen any as you have , low boor as you are , that have been born and bred among them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but tell me , your worship , now that peace is made between us ( and may god bring you out of all the adventures that may befall you as safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one ) , was it not a thing to laugh at , and is it not a good story , the great fear we were in? at least that i was in; for as to your worship i see now that you neither know nor understand what either fear or dismay is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but let that pass; all will come out in the scouring; for i have heard say he loves thee well that makes thee weep;  and moreover that it is the way with great lords after any hard words they give a servant to give him a pair of breeches; though i do not know what they give after blows , unless it be that knights - errant after blows give islands , or kingdoms on the mainland . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there was gandalin , the squire of amadis of gaul , that was count of the insula firme , and we read of him that he always addressed his lord with his cap in his hand , his head bowed down and his body bent double , more turquesco . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then , what shall we say of gasabal , the squire of galaor , who was so silent that in order to indicate to us the greatness of his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in the whole of that history , as long as it is truthful? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the favours and benefits that i have promised you will come in due time , and if they do not your wages at least will not be lost , as i have already told you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all that your worship says is very well , said sancho ,  - but i should like to know ( in case the time of favours should not come , and it might be necessary to fall back upon wages ) how much did the squire of a knight - errant get in those days , and did they agree by the month , or by the day like bricklayers? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not believe , replied don quixote ,  - that such squires were ever on wages , but were dependent on favour; and if i have now mentioned thine in the sealed will i have left at home , it was with a view to what may happen; for as yet i know not how chivalry will turn out in these wretched times of ours , and i do not wish my soul to suffer for trifles in the other world; for i would have thee know , sancho , that in this there is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it now began to rain a little , and sancho was for going into the fulling mills , but don quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on account of the late joke that he would not enter them on any account; so turning aside to right they came upon another road , different from that which they had taken the night before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shortly afterwards don quixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold , and the moment he saw him he turned to sancho and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i say so because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were looking for against us , cheating us with the fulling mills , it now opens wide another one for another better and more certain adventure , and if i do not contrive to enter it , it will be my own fault , and i cannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills , or the darkness of the night . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say this because , if i mistake not , there comes towards us one who wears on his head the helmet of mambrino , concerning which i took the oath thou rememberest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mind what you say , your worship , and still more what you do , said sancho ,  - for i don t want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling and knocking our senses out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the devil take thee , man , said don quixote;  - what has a helmet to do with fulling mills? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , that is the helmet of mambrino , said don quixote;  - stand to one side and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how , without saying a word , to save time , i shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess myself of the helmet i have so longed for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have told thee , brother , on no account to mention those fulling mills to me again , said don quixote ,  - or i vowand i say no morei ll full the soul out of you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow he had hurled like a bowl at him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fact of the matter as regards the helmet , steed , and knight that don quixote saw , was this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in that neighbourhood there were two villages , one of them so small that it had neither apothecary s shop nor barber , which the other that was close to it had , so the barber of the larger served the smaller , and in it there was a sick man who required to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved , and on this errand the barber was going , carrying with him a brass basin; but as luck would have it , as he was on the way it began to rain , and not to spoil his hat , which probably was a new one , he put the basin on his head , and being clean it glittered at half a league s distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he rode upon a grey ass , as sancho said , and this was what made it seem to don quixote to be a dapple - grey steed and a knight and a golden helmet; for everything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry and ill - errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight draw near , without entering into any parley with him , at rocinante s top speed he bore down upon him with the pike pointed low , fully determined to run him through and through , and as he reached him , without checking the fury of his charge , he cried to him: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - defend thyself , miserable being , or yield me of thine own accord that which is so reasonably my due . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the barber , who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this apparition coming down upon him , had no other way of saving himself from the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and no sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than a deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he told sancho to pick up the helmet , and he taking it in his hands said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by god the basin is a good one , and worth a real of eight if it is worth a maravedis , and handed it to his master , who immediately put it on his head , turning it round , now this way , now that , in search of fitment , and not finding it he said ,  - clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous head - piece was first forged must have had a very large head; but the worst of it is half of it is wanting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to restrain his laughter , but remembering his master s wrath he checked himself in the midst of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what art thou laughing at , sancho? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am laughing , said he ,  - to think of the great head the pagan must have had who owned this helmet , for it looks exactly like a regular barber s basin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - dost thou know what i suspect , sancho? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote;  - that this wonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accident have come into the hands of some one who was unable to recognise or realise its value , and who , not knowing what he did , and seeing it to be of the purest gold , must have melted down one half for the sake of what it might be worth , and of the other made this which is like a barber s basin as thou sayest; but be it as it may , to me who recognise it , its transformation makes no difference , for i will set it to rights at the first village where there is a blacksmith , and in such style that that helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles shall not surpass it or even come up to it; and in the meantime i will wear it as well as i can , for something is better than nothing; all the more as it will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is , said sancho ,  - if it is not shot with a sling as they were in the battle of the two armies , when they signed the cross on your worship s grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that made me vomit my bowels up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so have i , answered sancho ,  - but if ever i make it , or try it again as long as i live , may this be my last hour; moreover , i have no intention of putting myself in the way of wanting it , for i mean , with all my five senses , to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone: as to being blanketed again i say nothing , for it is hard to prevent mishaps of that sort , and if they come there is nothing for it but to squeeze our shoulders together , hold our breath , shut our eyes , and let ourselves go where luck and the blanket may send us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thou art a bad christian , sancho , said don quixote on hearing this ,  - for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: but know that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach importance to trifles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what lame leg hast thou got by it , what broken rib , what cracked head , that thou canst not forget that jest? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for jest and sport it was , properly regarded , and had i not seen it in that light i would have returned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the greeks did for the rape of helen , who , if she were alive now , or if my dulcinea had lived then , might depend upon it she would not be so famous for her beauty as she is; and here he heaved a sigh and sent it aloft; and said sancho ,  - let it pass for a jest as it cannot be revenged in earnest , but i know what sort of jest and earnest it was , and i know it will never be rubbed out of my memory any more than off my shoulders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for , from the way he took to his heels and bolted , he is not likely ever to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey is a good one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so urgent is it , answered sancho ,  - that if they were for my own person i could not want them more; and forthwith , fortified by this licence , he effected the mutatio capparum , rigging out his beast to the ninety - nines and making quite another thing of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this done , they broke their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter mule , and drank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills , without casting a look in that direction , in such loathing did they hold them for the alarm they had caused them; and , all anger and gloom removed , they mounted and , without taking any fixed road ( not to fix upon any being the proper thing for true knights - errant ) , they set out , guided by rocinante s will , which carried along with it that of his master , not to say that of the ass , which always followed him wherever he led , lovingly and sociably; nevertheless they returned to the high road , and pursued it at a venture without any other aim . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they went along , then , in this way sancho said to his master ,  - seor , would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for since you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to rot in my stomach , and i have now just one on the tip of my tongue that i don t want to be spoiled . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - say , on , sancho , said don quixote ,  - and be brief in thy discourse , for there is no pleasure in one that is long . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well then , seor , returned sancho ,  - i say that for some days past i have been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of these adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and cross - roads , where , even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved , there is no one to see or know of them , and so they must be left untold for ever , to the loss of your worship s object and the credit they deserve; therefore it seems to me it would be better ( saving your worship s better judgment ) if we were to go and serve some emperor or other great prince who may have some war on hand , in whose service your worship may prove the worth of your person , your great might , and greater understanding , on perceiving which the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have to reward us , each according to his merits; and there you will not be at a loss for some one to set down your achievements in writing so as to preserve their memory for ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thou speakest not amiss , sancho , answered don quixote ,  - but before that point is reached it is requisite to roam the world , as it were on probation , seeking adventures , in order that , by achieving some , name and fame may be acquired , such that when he betakes himself to the court of some great monarch the knight may be already known by his deeds , and that the boys , the instant they see him enter the gate of the city , may all follow him and surround him , crying , this is the knight of the sun  - or the serpent , or any other title under which he may have achieved great deeds . </s> </s>

<s> <s> straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her eyes upon the knight and he his upon her , and each will seem to the other something more divine than human , and , without knowing how or why they will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love , and sorely distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their pains and sufferings known by speech . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thence they will lead him , no doubt , to some richly adorned chamber of the palace , where , having removed his armour , they will bring him a rich mantle of scarlet wherewith to robe himself , and if he looked noble in his armour he will look still more so in a doublet . </s> </s>

<s> <s> true it is i am a gentleman of known house , of estate and property , and entitled to the five hundred sueldos mulct; and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree that i may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; for i would have thee know , sancho , that there are two kinds of lineages in the world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings and princes , whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a point like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords; so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are , and the others are what they formerly were not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and i may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove great and famous , with which the king , my father - in - law that is to be , ought to be satisfied; and should he not be , the princess will so love me that even though she well knew me to be the son of a water - carrier , she will take me for her lord and husband in spite of her father; if not , then it comes to seizing her and carrying her off where i please; for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - that is a chain of galley slaves , on the way to the galleys by force of the king s orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how by force? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> asked don quixote;  - is it possible that the king uses force against anyone? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not say that , answered sancho ,  - but that these are people condemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king s galleys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in fact , replied don quixote ,  - however it may be , these people are going where they are taking them by force , and not of their own will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - recollect , your worship , said sancho ,  - justice , which is the king himself , is not using force or doing wrong to such persons , but punishing them for their crimes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the chain of galley slaves had by this time come up , and don quixote in very courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be good enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were conducting these people in this manner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the guards on horseback answered that they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty , that they were going to the galleys , and that was all that was to be said and all he had any business to know . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of every one of these wretches , this is no time to take them out or read them; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose , and they will , for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about rascalities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this permission , which don quixote would have taken even had they not granted it , he approached the chain and asked the first for what offences he was now in such a sorry case . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - for that only? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied don quixote;  - why , if for being lovers they send people to the galleys i might have been rowing in them long ago . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the love is not the sort your worship is thinking of , said the galley slave;  - mine was that i loved a washerwoman s basket of clean linen so well , and held it so close in my embrace , that if the arm of the law had not forced it from me , i should never have let it go of my own will to this moment; i was caught in the act , there was no occasion for torture , the case was settled , they treated me to a hundred lashes on the back , and three years of gurapas besides , and that was the end of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what are gurapas? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - gurapas are galleys , answered the galley slave , who was a young man of about four - and - twenty , and said he was a native of piedrahita . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote asked the same question of the second , who made no reply , so downcast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him , and said ,  - he , sir , goes as a canary , i mean as a musician and a singer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote ,  - for being musicians and singers are people sent to the galleys too? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - yes , sir , answered the galley slave ,  - for there is nothing worse than singing under suffering . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on the contrary , i have heard say , said don quixote ,  - that he who sings scares away his woes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - here it is the reverse , said the galley slave;  - for he who sings once weeps all his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do not understand it , said don quixote; but one of the guards said to him ,  - sir , to sing under suffering means with the non sancta fraternity to confess under torture; they put this sinner to the torture and he confessed his crime , which was being a cuatrero , that is a cattle - stealer , and on his confession they sentenced him to six years in the galleys , besides two hundred lashes that he has already had on the back; and he is always dejected and downcast because the other thieves that were left behind and that march here ill - treat , and snub , and jeer , and despise him for confessing and not having spirit enough to say nay; for , say they , nay  has no more letters in it than yea ,  and a culprit is well off when life or death with him depends on his own tongue and not on that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinking they are not very far out . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble , said don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but god is great; patiencethere , that s enough of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote passed on to the fourth , a man of venerable aspect with a white beard falling below his breast , who on hearing himself asked the reason of his being there began to weep without answering a word , but the fifth acted as his tongue and said ,  - this worthy man is going to the galleys for four years , after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on horseback . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that means , said sancho panza ,  - as i take it , to have been exposed to shame in public . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - just so , replied the galley slave ,  - and the offence for which they gave him that punishment was having been an ear - broker , nay body - broker; i mean , in short , that this gentleman goes as a pimp , and for having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if that touch had not been thrown in , said don quixote ,  - he would not deserve , for mere pimping , to row in the galleys , but rather to command and be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one , being the office of persons of discretion , one very necessary in a well - ordered state , and only to be exercised by persons of good birth; nay , there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them , as in other offices , and recognised number , as with the brokers on change; in this way many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by this office and calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people , such as women more or less silly , and pages and jesters of little standing and experience , who on the most urgent occasions , and when ingenuity of contrivance is needed , let the crumbs freeze on the way to their mouths , and know not which is their right hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i should like to go farther , and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose those who are to hold so necessary an office in the state , but this is not the fit place for it; some day i will expound the matter to some one able to see to and rectify it; all i say now is , that the additional fact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see these white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful a position on account of his being a pimp; though i know well there are no sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some simple folk fancy , for our will is free , nor is there herb or charm that can force it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that certain silly women and quacks do is to turn men mad with potions and poisons , pretending that they have power to cause love , for , as i say , it is an impossibility to compel the will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is true , said the good old man ,  - and indeed , sir , as far as the charge of sorcery goes i was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp i cannot deny it; but i never thought i was doing any harm by it , for my only object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peace and quiet , without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions were unavailing to save me from going where i never expect to come back from , with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that never gives me a moment s ease; and again he fell to weeping as before , and such compassion did sancho feel for him that he took out a real of four from his bosom and gave it to him in alms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote went on and asked another what his crime was , and the man answered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the last one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am here because i carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins of mine , and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; in short , i carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a complicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear: it was all proved against me , i got no favour , i had no money , i was near having my neck stretched , they sentenced me to the galleys for six years , i accepted my fate , it is the punishment of my fault; i am a young man; let life only last , and with that all will come right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you , sir , have anything wherewith to help the poor , god will repay it to you in heaven , and we on earth will take care in our petitions to him to pray for the life and health of your worship , that they may be as long and as good as your amiable appearance deserves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind all these there came a man of thirty , a very personable fellow , except that when he looked , his eyes turned in a little one towards the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was bound differently from the rest , for he had to his leg a chain so long that it was wound all round his body , and two rings on his neck , one attached to the chain , the other to what they call a  - keep - friend or  - friend s foot , from which hung two irons reaching to his waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were secured by a big padlock , so that he could neither raise his hands to his mouth nor lower his head to his hands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote asked why this man carried so many more chains than the others . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the guard replied that it was because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put together , and was so daring and such a villain , that though they marched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him , but were in dread of his making his escape . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - he goes for ten years , replied the guard ,  - which is the same thing as civil death , and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the famous gines de pasamonte , otherwise called ginesillo de parapilla . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - don t they call you so , you liar? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - is it so good? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so good is it , replied gines ,  - that a fig for lazarillo de tormes ,  and all of that kind that have been written , or shall be written compared with it: all i will say about it is that it deals with facts , and facts so neat and diverting that no lies could match them . </s> </s>

<s> <s> asked don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in the service of god and the king i have been there for four years before now , and i know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are like , replied gines;  - and it is no great grievance to me to go back to them , for there i shall have time to finish my book; i have still many things left to say , and in the galleys of spain there is more than enough leisure; though i do not want much for what i have to write , for i have it by heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it persecutes rogues , said the commissary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i told you already to go gently , master commissary , said pasamonte;  - their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill - treat us wretches here , but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you; if not , by the life ofnever mind; it may be that some day the stains made in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his tongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on , for we have had quite enough of this entertainment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the commissary lifted his staff to strike pasamonte in return for his threats , but don quixote came between them , and begged him not to ill - use him , as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all which presents itself now to my mind , urging , persuading , and even compelling me to demonstrate in your case the purpose for which heaven sent me into the world and caused me to make profession of the order of chivalry to which i belong , and the vow i took therein to give aid to those in need and under the oppression of the strong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as i know that it is a mark of prudence not to do by foul means what may be done by fair , i will ask these gentlemen , the guards and commissary , to be so good as to release you and let you go in peace , as there will be no lack of others to serve the king under more favourable circumstances; for it seems to me a hard case to make slaves of those whom god and nature have made free . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this request i make thus gently and quietly , that , if you comply with it , i may have reason for thanking you; and , if you will not voluntarily , this lance and sword together with the might of my arm shall compel you to comply with it by force . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - tis you that are the cat , rat , and rascal , replied don quixote , and acting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with a lance - thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had the musket . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this unexpected event , but recovering presence of mind , those on horseback seized their swords , and those on foot their javelins , and attacked don quixote , who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it would have gone badly with him if the galley slaves , seeing the chance before them of liberating themselves , had not effected it by contriving to break the chain on which they were strung . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such was the confusion , that the guards , now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking loose , now to attack don quixote who was waiting for them , did nothing at all that was of any use . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho , on his part , gave a helping hand to release gines de pasamonte , who was the first to leap forth upon the plain free and unfettered , and who , attacking the prostrate commissary , took from him his sword and the musket , with which , aiming at one and levelling at another , he , without ever discharging it , drove every one of the guards off the field , for they took to flight , as well to escape pasamonte s musket , as the showers of stones the now released galley slaves were raining upon them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> gines de pasamonte made answer for all , saying ,  - that which you , sir , our deliverer , demand of us , is of all impossibilities the most impossible to comply with , because we cannot go together along the roads , but only singly and separate , and each one his own way , endeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the holy brotherhood , which , no doubt , will come out in search of us . </s> </s>

<s> <s> pasamonte , who was anything but meek ( being by this time thoroughly convinced that don quixote was not quite right in his head as he had committed such a vagary as to set them free ) , finding himself abused in this fashion , gave the wink to his companions , and falling back they began to shower stones on don quixote at such a rate that he was quite unable to protect himself with his buckler , and poor rocinante no more heeded the spur than if he had been made of brass . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - seor , replied sancho ,  - to retire is not to flee , and there is no wisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope , and it is the part of wise men to preserve themselves to - day for to - morrow , and not risk all in one day; and let me tell you , though i am a clown and a boor , i have got some notion of what they call safe conduct; so repent not of having taken my advice , but mount rocinante if you can , and if not i will help you; and follow me , for my mother - wit tells me we have more need of legs than hands just now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote mounted without replying , and , sancho leading the way on his ass , they entered the side of the sierra morena , which was close by , as it was sancho s design to cross it entirely and come out again at el viso or almodovar del campo , and hide for some days among its crags so as to escape the search of the brotherhood should they come to look for them . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i only said chloe , replied don quixote;  - and that no doubt , is the name of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and , faith , he must be a tolerable poet , or i know little of the craft . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then your worship understands rhyming too? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - read more , your worship , said sancho ,  - and you will find something that will enlighten us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a correspondence letter , seor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from the beginning it seems to be a love letter , replied don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then let your worship read it aloud , said sancho ,  - for i am very fond of love matters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with all my heart , said don quixote , and reading it aloud as sancho had requested him , he found it ran thus: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence the news of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ungrateful one , thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy , but not more worthy; but if virtue were esteemed wealth i should neither envy the fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what thy beauty raised up thy deeds have laid low; by it i believed thee to be an angel , by them i know thou art a woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peace be with thee who hast sent war to me , and heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever hidden from thee , so that thou repent not of what thou hast done , and i reap not a revenge i would not have . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the knight of the rueful countenance was still very anxious to find out who the owner of the valise could be , conjecturing from the sonnet and letter , from the money in gold , and from the fineness of the shirts , that he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his lady had driven to some desperate course; but as in that uninhabited and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he could inquire , he saw nothing else for it but to push on , taking whatever road rocinante chosewhich was where he could make his wayfirmly persuaded that among these wilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as well as he could make out he was unclad , with a thick black beard , long tangled hair , and bare legs and feet , his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvet but so ragged that they showed his skin in several places . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was bareheaded , and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed as has been described , the knight of the rueful countenance observed and noted all these trifles , and though he made the attempt , he was unable to follow him , for it was not granted to the feebleness of rocinante to make way over such rough ground , he being , moreover , slow - paced and sluggish by nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i could not do that , said sancho ,  - for when i separate from your worship fear at once lays hold of me , and assails me with all sorts of panics and fancies; and let what i now say be a notice that from this time forth i am not going to stir a finger s width from your presence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it shall be so , said he of the rueful countenance ,  - and i am very glad that thou art willing to rely on my courage , which will never fail thee , even though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behind me slowly as well as thou canst , and make lanterns of thine eyes; let us make the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this man that we saw , who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which sancho made answer ,  - far better would it be not to look for him , for , if we find him , and he happens to be the owner of the money , it is plain i must restore it; it would be better , therefore , that without taking this needless trouble , i should keep possession of it until in some other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner may be discovered; and perhaps that will be when i shall have spent it , and then the king will hold me harmless . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd watching his flock , and suddenly on their left there appeared a great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the goatherd in charge of them , a man advanced in years . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote called aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he shouted in return , asking what had brought them to that spot , seldom or never trodden except by the feet of goats , or of the wolves and other wild beasts that roamed around . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho in return bade him come down , and they would explain all to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the goatherd descended , and reaching the place where don quixote stood , he said ,  - i will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead in the hollow there , and , faith , it has been lying there now these six months; tell me , have you come upon its master about here? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - we have come upon nobody , answered don quixote ,  - nor on anything except a saddle - pad and a little valise that we found not far from this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i found it too , said the goatherd ,  - but i would not lift it nor go near it for fear of some ill - luck or being charged with theft , for the devil is crafty , and things rise up under one s feet to make one fall without knowing why or wherefore . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that s exactly what i say , said sancho;  - i found it too , and i would not go within a stone s throw of it; there i left it , and there it lies just as it was , for i don t want a dog with a bell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me , good man , said don quixote ,  - do you know who is the owner of this property? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he asked us what part of this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was where we now are; and so in truth it is , for if you push on half a league farther , perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and i am wondering how you have managed to come here , for there is no road or path that leads to this spot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when some of us goatherds learned this we went in search of him for about two days through the most remote portion of this sierra , at the end of which we found him lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he came out to meet us with great gentleness , with his dress now torn and his face so disfigured and burned by the sun , that we hardly recognised him but that his clothes , though torn , convinced us , from the recollection we had of them , that he was the person we were looking for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent , keeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time , during which we stood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this abstraction; and with no little pity , for from his behaviour , now staring at the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving an eyelid , again closing them , compressing his lips and raising his eyebrows , we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind had come upon him; and before long he showed that what we imagined was the truth , for he arose in a fury from the ground where he had thrown himself , and attacked the first he found near him with such rage and fierceness that if we had not dragged him off him , he would have beaten or bitten him to death , all the while exclaiming , oh faithless fernando , here , here shalt thou pay the penalty of the wrong thou hast done me; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine , abode and dwelling of all iniquity , but of deceit and fraud above all; and to these he added other words all in effect upbraiding this fernando and charging him with treachery and faithlessness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , sirs , is all i can say in answer to what you have asked me; and be sure that the owner of the articles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness and so naked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for don quixote had already described how he had seen the man go bounding along the mountain side , and he was now filled with amazement at what he heard from the goatherd , and more eager than ever to discover who the unhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved , as he had done before , to search for him all over the mountain , not leaving a corner or cave unexamined until he had found him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but chance arranged matters better than he expected or hoped , for at that very moment , in a gorge on the mountain that opened where they stood , the youth he wished to find made his appearance , coming along talking to himself in a way that would have been unintelligible near at hand , much more at a distance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> his garb was what has been described , save that as he drew near , don quixote perceived that a tattered doublet which he wore was amber - tanned , from which he concluded that one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> approaching them , the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but with great courtesy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote returned his salutation with equal politeness , and dismounting from rocinante advanced with well - bred bearing and grace to embrace him , and held him for some time close in his arms as if he had known him for a long time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the other , whom we may call the ragged one of the sorry countenance , as don quixote was of the rueful , after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and , placing his hands on don quixote s shoulders , stood gazing at him as if seeking to see whether he knew him , not less amazed , perhaps , at the sight of the face , figure , and armour of don quixote than don quixote was at the sight of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to be brief , the first to speak after embracing was the ragged one , and he said what will be told farther on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the history relates that it was with the greatest attention don quixote listened to the ragged knight of the sierra , who began by saying: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - mine , replied don quixote ,  - is to be of service to you , so much so that i had resolved not to quit these mountains until i had found you , and learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for that sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to labour; and to search for you with all possible diligence , if search had been necessary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and if your misfortune should prove to be one of those that refuse admission to any sort of consolation , it was my purpose to join you in lamenting and mourning over it , so far as i could; for it is still some comfort in misfortune to find one who can feel for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and if my good intentions deserve to be acknowledged with any kind of courtesy , i entreat you , seor , by that which i perceive you possess in so high a degree , and likewise conjure you by whatever you love or have loved best in life , to tell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like a brute beast , dwelling among them in a manner so foreign to your condition as your garb and appearance show . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the knight of the thicket , hearing him of the rueful countenance talk in this strain , did nothing but stare at him , and stare at him again , and again survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughly examined him , he said to him: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if you have anything to give me to eat , for god s sake give it me , and after i have eaten i will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the goodwill you have displayed towards me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as he had done he made signs to them to follow him , which they did , and he led them to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner of a rock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass , and the others did the same , all keeping silence , until the ragged one , settling himself in his place , said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i give you this warning because i wish to pass briefly over the story of my misfortunes , for recalling them to memory only serves to add fresh ones , and the less you question me the sooner shall i make an end of the recital , though i shall not omit to relate anything of importance in order fully to satisfy your curiosity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - my name is cardenio , my birthplace one of the best cities of this andalusia , my family noble , my parents rich , my misfortune so great that my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being able by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can do little to relieve reverses sent by heaven . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in that same country there was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory i could desire; such was the beauty of luscinda , a damsel as noble and as rich as i , but of happier fortunes , and of less firmness than was due to so worthy a passion as mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this luscinda i loved , worshipped , and adored from my earliest and tenderest years , and she loved me in all the innocence and sincerity of childhood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we grew up , and with our growth grew the love between us , so that the father of luscinda felt bound for propriety s sake to refuse me admission to his house , in this perhaps imitating the parents of that thisbe so celebrated by the poets , and this refusal but added love to love and flame to flame; for though they enforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose it upon our pens , which can make known the heart s secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues; for many a time the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> ah heavens! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how many ditties and love - songs did i compose in which my heart declared and made known its feelings , described its ardent longings , revelled in its recollections and dallied with its desires! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thanked him for his kindness , reflecting that there was reason in what he said , and that my father would assent to it as soon as i should tell him , and with that view i went the very same instant to let him know what my desires were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i entered the room where he was i found him with an open letter in his hand , which , before i could utter a word , he gave me , saying , by this letter thou wilt see , cardenio , the disposition the duke ricardo has to serve thee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i took and read the letter , which was couched in terms so flattering that even i myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply with the request the duke made in it , which was that he would send me immediately to him , as he wished me to become the companion , not servant , of his eldest son , and would take upon himself the charge of placing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he held me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on reading the letter my voice failed me , and still more when i heard my father say , two days hence thou wilt depart , cardenio , in accordance with the duke s wish , and give thanks to god who is opening a road to thee by which thou mayest attain what i know thou dost deserve; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> finally , i presented myself to the duke , and was received and treated by him so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work , the old servants growing envious of me , and regarding the duke s inclination to show me favour as an injury to themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the one to whom my arrival gave the greatest pleasure was the duke s second son , fernando by name , a gallant youth , of noble , generous , and amorous disposition , who very soon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody; for though the elder was attached to me , and showed me kindness , he did not carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as don fernando . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when i heard him say so , even if his resolution had not been so good a one i should have hailed it as one of the happiest that could be imagined , prompted by my affection , seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it offered me of returning to see my luscinda . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this thought and wish i commended his idea and encouraged his design , advising him to put it into execution as quickly as possible , as , in truth , absence produced its effect in spite of the most deeply rooted feelings . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened , then , that as with young men love is for the most part nothing more than appetite , which , as its final object is enjoyment , comes to an end on obtaining it , and that which seemed to be love takes to flight , as it cannot pass the limit fixed by nature , which fixes no limit to true lovewhat i mean is that after don fernando had enjoyed this peasant girl his passion subsided and his eagerness cooled , and if at first he feigned a wish to absent himself in order to cure his love , he was now in reality anxious to go to avoid keeping his promise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the duke gave him permission , and ordered me to accompany him; we arrived at my city , and my father gave him the reception due to his rank; i saw luscinda without delay , and , though it had not been dead or deadened , my love gathered fresh life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to my misfortune i yielded to it , showing her to him one night by the light of a taper at a window where we used to talk to one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she appeared to him in her dressing - gown , she drove all the beauties he had seen until then out of his recollection; speech failed him , his head turned , he was spell - bound , and in the end love - smitten , as you will see in the course of the story of my misfortune; and to inflame still further his passion , which he hid from me and revealed to heaven alone , it so happened that one day he found a note of hers entreating me to demand her of her father in marriage , so delicate , so modest , and so tender , that on reading it he told me that in luscinda alone were combined all the charms of beauty and understanding that were distributed among all the other women in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true , and i own it now , that though i knew what good cause don fernando had to praise luscinda , it gave me uneasiness to hear these praises from his mouth , and i began to fear , and with reason to feel distrust of him , for there was no moment when he was not ready to talk of luscinda , and he would start the subject himself even though he dragged it in unseasonably , a circumstance that aroused in me a certain amount of jealousy; not that i feared any change in the constancy or faith of luscinda; but still my fate led me to forebode what she assured me against . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don fernando contrived always to read the letters i sent to luscinda and her answers to me , under the pretence that he enjoyed the wit and sense of both . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it so happened , then , that luscinda having begged of me a book of chivalry to read , one that she was very fond of , amadis of gaul<s> <s> don quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned , than he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the lady luscinda was fond of books of chivalry , no other laudation would have been requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding , for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for such delightful reading been wanting; so , as far as i am concerned , you need waste no more words in describing her beauty , worth , and intelligence; for , on merely hearing what her taste was , i declare her to be the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world; and i wish your worship had , along with amadis of gaul , sent her the worthy don rugel of greece , for i know the lady luscinda would greatly relish daraida and garaya , and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd darinel , and the admirable verses of his bucolics , sung and delivered by him with such sprightliness , wit , and ease; but a time may come when this omission can be remedied , and to rectify it nothing more is needed than for your worship to be so good as to come with me to my village , for there i can give you more than three hundred books which are the delight of my soul and the entertainment of my life;though it occurs to me that i have not got one of them now , thanks to the spite of wicked and envious enchanters;but pardon me for having broken the promise we made not to interrupt your discourse; for when i hear chivalry or knights - errant mentioned , i can no more help talking about them than the rays of the sun can help giving heat , or those of the moon moisture; pardon me , therefore , and proceed , for that is more to the purpose now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while don quixote was saying this , cardenio allowed his head to fall upon his breast , and seemed plunged in deep thought; and though twice don quixote bade him go on with his story , he neither looked up nor uttered a word in reply; but after some time he raised his head and said ,  - i cannot get rid of the idea , nor will anyone in the world remove it , or make me think otherwiseand he would be a blockhead who would hold or believe anything else than that that arrant knave master elisabad made free with queen madasima . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is not true , by all that s good , said don quixote in high wrath , turning upon him angrily , as his way was;  - and it is a very great slander , or rather villainy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> queen madasima was a very illustrious lady , and it is not to be supposed that so exalted a princess would have made free with a quack; and whoever maintains the contrary lies like a great scoundrel , and i will give him to know it , on foot or on horseback , armed or unarmed , by night or by day , or as he likes best . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cardenio was looking at him steadily , and his mad fit having now come upon him , he had no disposition to go on with his story , nor would don quixote have listened to it , so much had what he had heard about madasima disgusted him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cardenio , then , being , as i said , now mad , when he heard himself given the lie , and called a scoundrel and other insulting names , not relishing the jest , snatched up a stone that he found near him , and with it delivered such a blow on don quixote s breast that he laid him on his back . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho panza , seeing his master treated in this fashion , attacked the madman with his closed fist; but the ragged one received him in such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet , and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; the goatherd , who came to the rescue , shared the same fate; and having beaten and pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to his hiding - place on the mountain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho retorted , and the goatherd rejoined , and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by the beard , and exchanging such fisticuffs that if don quixote had not made peace between them , they would have knocked one another to pieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is true , said don quixote ,  - but i know that he is not to blame for what has happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the goatherd told him , as he had told him before , that there was no knowing of a certainty where his lair was; but that if he wandered about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to fall in with him either in or out of his senses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if luck would have it that animals spoke as they did in the days of guisopete , it would not be so bad , because i could talk to rocinante about whatever came into my head , and so put up with my ill - fortune; but it is a hard case , and not to be borne with patience , to go seeking adventures all one s life and get nothing but kicks and blanketings , brickbats and punches , and with all this to have to sew up one s mouth without daring to say what is in one s heart , just as if one were dumb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i understand thee , sancho , replied don quixote;  - thou art dying to have the interdict i placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it removed , and say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so be it , said sancho;  - let me speak now , for god knows what will happen by - and - by; and to take advantage of the permit at once , i ask , what made your worship stand up so for that queen majimasa , or whatever her name is , or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of hers or not? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for if your worship had let that passand you were not a judge in the matterit is my belief the madman would have gone on with his story , and the blow of the stone , and the kicks , and more than half a dozen cuffs would have been escaped . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in faith , sancho , answered don quixote ,  - if thou knewest as i do what an honourable and illustrious lady queen madasima was , i know thou wouldst say i had great patience that i did not break in pieces the mouth that uttered such blasphemies , for a very great blasphemy it is to say or imagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the truth of the story is that that master elisabad whom the madman mentioned was a man of great prudence and sound judgment , and served as governor and physician to the queen , but to suppose that she was his mistress is nonsense deserving very severe punishment; and as a proof that cardenio did not know what he was saying , remember when he said it he was out of his wits . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is what i say , said sancho;  - there was no occasion for minding the words of a madman; for if good luck had not helped your worship , and he had sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast , a fine way we should have been in for standing up for my lady yonder , god confound her! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - against men in their senses or against madmen , said don quixote ,  - every knight - errant is bound to stand up for the honour of women , whoever they may be , much more for queens of such high degree and dignity as queen madasima , for whom i have a particular regard on account of her amiable qualities; for , besides being extremely beautiful , she was very wise , and very patient under her misfortunes , of which she had many; and the counsel and society of the master elisabad were a great help and support to her in enduring her afflictions with wisdom and resignation; hence the ignorant and ill - disposed vulgar took occasion to say and think that she was his mistress; and they lie , i say it once more , and will lie two hundred times more , all who think and say so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> many think there are flitches where there are no hooks; but who can put gates to the open plain? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what has what we are talking about got to do with the proverbs thou art threading one after the other? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for god s sake hold thy tongue , sancho , and henceforward keep to prodding thy ass and don t meddle in what does not concern thee; and understand with all thy five senses that everything i have done , am doing , or shall do , is well founded on reason and in conformity with the rules of chivalry , for i understand them better than all the world that profess them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - seor , replied sancho ,  - is it a good rule of chivalry that we should go astray through these mountains without path or road , looking for a madman who when he is found will perhaps take a fancy to finish what he began , not his story , but your worship s head and my ribs , and end by breaking them altogether for us? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - peace , i say again , sancho , said don quixote ,  - for let me tell thee it is not so much the desire of finding that madman that leads me into these regions as that which i have of performing among them an achievement wherewith i shall win eternal name and fame throughout the known world; and it shall be such that i shall thereby set the seal on all that can make a knight - errant perfect and famous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and is it very perilous , this achievement? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , replied he of the rueful countenance;  - though it may be in the dice that we may throw deuce - ace instead of sixes; but all will depend on thy diligence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sancho . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a fig for don belianis , and for all who say he equalled him in any respect , for , my oath upon it , they are deceiving themselves! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say , too , that when a painter desires to become famous in his art he endeavours to copy the originals of the rarest painters that he knows; and the same rule holds good for all the most important crafts and callings that serve to adorn a state; thus must he who would be esteemed prudent and patient imitate ulysses , in whose person and labours homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and patience; as virgil , too , shows us in the person of neas the virtue of a pious son and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain; not representing or describing them as they were , but as they ought to be , so as to leave the example of their virtues to posterity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , then , being so , i consider , friend sancho , that the knight - errant who shall imitate him most closely will come nearest to reaching the perfection of chivalry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so , as it is easier for me to imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder , cutting off serpents  heads , slaying dragons , routing armies , destroying fleets , and breaking enchantments , and as this place is so well suited for a similar purpose , i must not allow the opportunity to escape which now so conveniently offers me its forelock . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what is it in reality , said sancho ,  - that your worship means to do in such an out - of - the - way place as this? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - have i not told thee , answered don quixote ,  - that i mean to imitate amadis here , playing the victim of despair , the madman , the maniac , so as at the same time to imitate the valiant don roland , when at the fountain he had evidence of the fair angelica having disgraced herself with medoro and through grief thereat went mad , and plucked up trees , troubled the waters of the clear springs , slew shepherds , destroyed flocks , burned down huts , levelled houses , dragged mares after him , and perpetrated a hundred thousand other outrages worthy of everlasting renown and record? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and though i have no intention of imitating roland , or orlando , or rotolando ( for he went by all these names ) , step by step in all the mad things he did , said , and thought , i will make a rough copy to the best of my power of all that seems to me most essential; but perhaps i shall content myself with the simple imitation of amadis , who without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow , gained as much fame as the most famous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it seems to me , said sancho ,  - that the knights who behaved in this way had provocation and cause for those follies and penances; but what cause has your worship for going mad? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is the point , replied don quixote ,  - and that is the beauty of this business of mine; no thanks to a knight - errant for going mad when he has cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation , and let my lady know , if i do this in the dry , what i would do in the moist; moreover i have abundant cause in the long separation i have endured from my lady till death , dulcinea del toboso; for as thou didst hear that shepherd ambrosio say the other day , in absence all ills are felt and feared; and so , friend sancho , waste no time in advising me against so rare , so happy , and so unheard - of an imitation; mad i am , and mad i must be until thou returnest with the answer to a letter that i mean to send by thee to my lady dulcinea; and if it be such as my constancy deserves , my insanity and penance will come to an end; and if it be to the opposite effect , i shall become mad in earnest , and , being so , i shall suffer no more; thus in whatever way she may answer i shall escape from the struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me , enjoying in my senses the boon thou bearest me , or as a madman not feeling the evil thou bringest me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but tell me , sancho , hast thou got mambrino s helmet safe? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which sancho made answer ,  - by the living god , sir knight of the rueful countenance , i cannot endure or bear with patience some of the things that your worship says; and from them i begin to suspect that all you tell me about chivalry , and winning kingdoms and empires , and giving islands , and bestowing other rewards and dignities after the custom of knights - errant , must be all made up of wind and lies , and all pigments or figments , or whatever we may call them; for what would anyone think that heard your worship calling a barber s basin mambrino s helmet without ever seeing the mistake all this time , but that one who says and maintains such things must have his brains addled? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have the basin in my sack all dinted , and i am taking it home to have it mended , to trim my beard in it , if , by god s grace , i am allowed to see my wife and children some day or other . </s> </s>

<s> <s> is it possible that all this time thou hast been going about with me thou hast never found out that all things belonging to knights - errant seem to be illusions and nonsense and ravings , and to go always by contraries? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and not because it really is so , but because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance upon us that change and alter everything with us , and turn things as they please , and according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us; thus what seems to thee a barber s basin seems to me mambrino s helmet , and to another it will seem something else; and rare foresight it was in the sage who is on my side to make what is really and truly mambrine s helmet seem a basin to everybody , for , being held in such estimation as it is , all the world would pursue me to rob me of it; but when they see it is only a barber s basin they do not take the trouble to obtain it; as was plainly shown by him who tried to break it , and left it on the ground without taking it , for , by my faith , had he known it he would never have left it behind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> keep it safe , my friend , for just now i have no need of it; indeed , i shall have to take off all this armour and remain as naked as i was born , if i have a mind to follow roland rather than amadis in my penance . </s> </s>

<s> <s> oh , ye rural deities , whoever ye be that haunt this lone spot , give ear to the complaint of a wretched lover whom long absence and brooding jealousy have driven to bewail his fate among these wilds and complain of the hard heart of that fair and ungrateful one , the end and limit of all human beauty! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - for the love of god , said sancho ,  - be careful , your worship , how you give yourself those knocks on the head , for you may come across such a rock , and in such a way , that the very first may put an end to the whole contrivance of this penance; and i should think , if indeed knocks on the head seem necessary to you , and this business cannot be done without them , you might be contentas the whole thing is feigned , and counterfeit , and in jokeyou might be content , i say , with giving them to yourself in the water , or against something soft , like cotton; and leave it all to me; for i ll tell my lady that your worship knocked your head against a point of rock harder than a diamond . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i thank thee for thy good intentions , friend sancho , answered don quixote ,  - but i would have thee know that all these things i am doing are not in joke , but very much in earnest , for anything else would be a transgression of the ordinances of chivalry , which forbid us to tell any lie whatever under the penalties due to apostasy; and to do one thing instead of another is just the same as lying; so my knocks on the head must be real , solid , and valid , without anything sophisticated or fanciful about them , and it will be needful to leave me some lint to dress my wounds , since fortune has compelled us to do without the balsam we lost . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - purgatory dost thou call it , sancho? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - that is true , said he of the rueful countenance ,  - but how shall we manage to write the letter? </s> </s>

<s> <s> but it has just occurred to me how it may be conveniently and even more than conveniently written , and that is in the note - book that belonged to cardenio , and thou wilt take care to have it copied on paper , in a good hand , at the first village thou comest to where there is a schoolmaster , or if not , any sacristan will copy it; but see thou give it not to any notary to copy , for they write a law hand that satan could not make out . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  and it will be no great matter if it is in some other person s hand , for as well as i recollect dulcinea can neither read nor write , nor in the whole course of her life has she seen handwriting or letter of mine , for my love and hers have been always platonic , not going beyond a modest look , and even that so seldom that i can safely swear i have not seen her four times in all these twelve years i have been loving her more than the light of these eyes that the earth will one day devour; and perhaps even of those four times she has not once perceived that i was looking at her: such is the retirement and seclusion in which her father lorenzo corchuelo and her mother aldonza nogales have brought her up . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so , so! </s> </s>

<s> <s> but i must own the truth to your worship , seor don quixote; until now i have been under a great mistake , for i believed truly and honestly that the lady dulcinea must be some princess your worship was in love with , or some person great enough to deserve the rich presents you have sent her , such as the biscayan and the galley slaves , and many more no doubt , for your worship must have won many victories in the time when i was not yet your squire . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i have before now told thee many times , sancho , said don quixote ,  - that thou art a mighty great chatterer , and that with a blunt wit thou art always striving at sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou art and how rational i am , i would have thee listen to a short story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thou must know that a certain widow , fair , young , independent , and rich , and above all free and easy , fell in love with a sturdy strapping young lay - brother; his superior came to know of it , and one day said to the worthy widow by way of brotherly remonstrance , i am surprised , seora , and not without good reason , that a woman of such high standing , so fair , and so rich as you are , should have fallen in love with such a mean , low , stupid fellow as so - and - so , when in this house there are so many masters , graduates , and divinity students from among whom you might choose as if they were a lot of pears , saying this one i ll take , that i won t take;  but she replied to him with great sprightliness and candour , my dear sir , you are very much mistaken , and your ideas are very old - fashioned , if you think that i have made a bad choice in so - and - so , fool as he seems; because for all i want with him he knows as much and more philosophy than aristotle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is not to be supposed that all those poets who sang the praises of ladies under the fancy names they give them , had any such mistresses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for thou shouldst know , sancho , if thou dost not know , that two things alone beyond all others are incentives to love , and these are great beauty and a good name , and these two things are to be found in dulcinea in the highest degree , for in beauty no one equals her and in good name few approach her; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell , i persuade myself that all i say is as i say , neither more nor less , and i picture her in my imagination as i would have her to be , as well in beauty as in condition; helen approaches her not nor does lucretia come up to her , nor any other of the famous women of times past , greek , barbarian , or latin; and let each say what he will , for if in this i am taken to task by the ignorant , i shall not be censured by the critical . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - listen , said don quixote ,  - this is what it says: </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - that will do , said sancho;  - now let your worship sign it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is no need to sign it , said don quixote ,  - but merely to put my flourish , which is the same as a signature , and enough for three asses , or even three hundred . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i can trust your worship , returned sancho;  - let me go and saddle rocinante , and be ready to give me your blessing , for i mean to go at once without seeing the fooleries your worship is going to do; i ll say i saw you do so many that she will not want any more . </s> </s>

<s> <s> if not , let the lady dulcinea look to it; if she does not answer reasonably , i swear as solemnly as i can that i will fetch a fair answer out of her stomach with kicks and cuffs; for why should it be borne that a knight - errant as famous as your worship should go mad without rhyme or reason for a? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her ladyship had best not drive me to say it , for by god i will speak out and let off everything cheap , even if it doesn t sell: i am pretty good at that! </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - i am not so mad , answered sancho ,  - but i am more peppery; but apart from all this , what has your worship to eat until i come back? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> will you sally out on the road like cardenio to force it from the shepherds? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let not that anxiety trouble thee , replied don quixote ,  - for even if i had it i should not eat anything but the herbs and the fruits which this meadow and these trees may yield me; the beauty of this business of mine lies in not eating , and in performing other mortifications . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you know what i am afraid of? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sancho upon this;  - that i shall not be able to find my way back to this spot where i am leaving you , it is such an out - of - the - way place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - observe the landmarks well , said don quixote ,  - for i will try not to go far from this neighbourhood , and i will even take care to mount the highest of these rocks to see if i can discover thee returning; however , not to miss me and lose thyself , the best plan will be to cut some branches of the broom that is so abundant about here , and as thou goest to lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain; these will serve thee , after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth of theseus , as marks and signs for finding me on thy return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so i will , said sancho panza , and having cut some , he asked his master s blessing , and not without many tears on both sides , took his leave of him , and mounting rocinante , of whom don quixote charged him earnestly to have as much care as of his own person , he set out for the plain , strewing at intervals the branches of broom as his master had recommended him; and so he went his way , though don quixote still entreated him to see him do were it only a couple of mad acts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he had not gone a hundred paces , however , when he returned and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i must say , seor , your worship said quite right , that in order to be able to swear without a weight on my conscience that i had seen you do mad things , it would be well for me to see if it were only one; though in your worship s remaining here i have seen a very great one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - did i not tell thee so? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - wait , sancho , and i will do them in the saying of a credo , and pulling off his breeches in all haste he stripped himself to his skin and his shirt , and then , without more ado , he cut a couple of gambados in the air , and a couple of somersaults , heels over head , making such a display that , not to see it a second time , sancho wheeled rocinante round , and felt easy , and satisfied in his mind that he could swear he had left his master mad; and so we will leave him to follow his road until his return , which was a quick one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> returning to the proceedings of him of the rueful countenance when he found himself alone , the history says that when don quixote had completed the performance of the somersaults or capers , naked from the waist down and clothed from the waist up , and saw that sancho had gone off without waiting to see any more crazy feats , he climbed up to the top of a high rock , and there set himself to consider what he had several times before considered without ever coming to any conclusion on the point , namely whether it would be better and more to his purpose to imitate the outrageous madness of roland , or the melancholy madness of amadis; and communing with himself he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what wonder is it if roland was so good a knight and so valiant as everyone says he was , when , after all , he was enchanted , and nobody could kill him save by thrusting a corking pin into the sole of his foot , and he always wore shoes with seven iron soles? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> though cunning devices did not avail him against bernardo del carpio , who knew all about them , and strangled him in his arms at roncesvalles . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but putting the question of his valour aside , let us come to his losing his wits , for certain it is that he did lose them in consequence of the proofs he discovered at the fountain , and the intelligence the shepherd gave him of angelica having slept more than two siestas with medoro , a little curly - headed moor , and page to agramante . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if he was persuaded that this was true , and that his lady had wronged him , it is no wonder that he should have gone mad; but i , how am i to imitate him in his madness , unless i can imitate him in the cause of it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for my dulcinea , i will venture to swear , never saw a moor in her life , as he is , in his proper costume , and she is this day as the mother that bore her , and i should plainly be doing her a wrong if , fancying anything else , i were to go mad with the same kind of madness as roland the furious . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> long live the memory of amadis and let him be imitated so far as is possible by don quixote of la mancha , of whom it will be said , as was said of the other , that if he did not achieve great things , he died in attempting them; and if i am not repulsed or rejected by my dulcinea , it is enough for me , as i have said , to be absent from her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so , now to business; come to my memory ye deeds of amadis , and show me how i am to begin to imitate you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then it occurred to him how he might make one , and that was by tearing a great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung down , and making eleven knots on it , one bigger than the rest , and this served him for a rosary all the time he was there , during which he repeated countless ave - marias . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what distressed him greatly was not having another hermit there to confess him and receive consolation from; and so he solaced himself with pacing up and down the little meadow , and writing and carving on the bark of the trees and on the fine sand a multitude of verses all in harmony with his sadness , and some in praise of dulcinea; but , when he was found there afterwards , the only ones completely legible that could be discovered were those that follow here: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the addition of  - del toboso to dulcinea s name gave rise to no little laughter among those who found the above lines , for they suspected don quixote must have fancied that unless he added  - del toboso when he introduced the name of dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible; which was indeed the fact , as he himself afterwards admitted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he wrote many more , but , as has been said , these three verses were all that could be plainly and perfectly deciphered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this way , and in sighing and calling on the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the streams , and echo , moist and mournful , to answer , console , and hear him , as well as in looking for herbs to sustain him , he passed his time until sancho s return; and had that been delayed three weeks , as it was three days , the knight of the rueful countenance would have worn such an altered countenance that the mother that bore him would not have known him: and here it will be well to leave him , wrapped up in sighs and verses , to relate how sancho panza fared on his mission . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as for him , coming out upon the high road , he made for el toboso , and the next day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket had befallen him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this craving drove him to draw near to the inn , still undecided whether to go in or not , and as he was hesitating there came out two persons who at once recognised him , and said one to the other: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - seor licentiate , is not he on the horse there sancho panza who , our adventurer s housekeeper told us , went off with her master as esquire? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so it is , said the licentiate ,  - and that is our friend don quixote s horse; and if they knew him so well it was because they were the curate and the barber of his own village , the same who had carried out the scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they recognised sancho panza and rocinante , being anxious to hear of don quixote , they approached , and calling him by his name the curate said ,  - friend sancho panza , where is your master? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho recognised them at once , and determined to keep secret the place and circumstances where and under which he had left his master , so he replied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certain matter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the eyes in his head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , nay , said the barber ,  - if you don t tell us where he is , sancho panza , we will suspect as we suspect already , that you have murdered and robbed him , for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact , you must produce the master of the hack , or else take the consequences . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they then asked sancho panza to show them the letter he was carrying to the lady dulcinea del toboso . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said it was written in a note - book , and that his master s directions were that he should have it copied on paper at the first village he came to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this the curate said if he showed it to him , he himself would make a fair copy of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho put his hand into his bosom in search of the note - book but could not find it , nor , if he had been searching until now , could he have found it , for don quixote had kept it , and had never given it to him , nor had he himself thought of asking for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when sancho discovered he could not find the book his face grew deadly pale , and in great haste he again felt his body all over , and seeing plainly it was not to be found , without more ado he seized his beard with both hands and plucked away half of it , and then , as quick as he could and without stopping , gave himself half a dozen cuffs on the face and nose till they were bathed in blood . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing this , the curate and the barber asked him what had happened him that he gave himself such rough treatment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied sancho ,  - but to have lost from one hand to the other , in a moment , three ass - colts , each of them like a castle? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how is that? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the barber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have lost the note - book , said sancho ,  - that contained the letter to dulcinea , and an order signed by my master in which he directed his niece to give me three ass - colts out of four or five he had at home; and he then told them about the loss of dapple . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curate consoled him , telling him that when his master was found he would get him to renew the order , and make a fresh draft on paper , as was usual and customary; for those made in notebooks were never accepted or honoured . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho comforted himself with this , and said if that were so the loss of dulcinea s letter did not trouble him much , for he had it almost by heart , and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever they liked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter to his memory , and balanced himself now on one foot , now the other , one moment staring at the ground , the next at the sky , and after having half gnawed off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting for him to begin , he said , after a long pause ,  - by god , seor licentiate , devil a thing can i recollect of the letter; but it said at the beginning , exalted and scrubbing lady . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - it cannot have said scrubbing ,  said the barber ,  - but superhuman  or sovereign . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - that is it , said sancho;  - then , as well as i remember , it went on , the wounded , and wanting of sleep , and the pierced , kisses your worship s hands , ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one; and it said something or other about health and sickness that he was sending her; and from that it went tailing off until it ended with yours till death , the knight of the rueful countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it gave them no little amusement , both of them , to see what a good memory sancho had , and they complimented him greatly upon it , and begged him to repeat the letter a couple of times more , so that they too might get it by heart to write it out by - and - by . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho repeated it three times , and as he did , uttered three thousand more absurdities; then he told them more about his master but he never said a word about the blanketing that had befallen himself in that inn , into which he refused to enter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he told them , moreover , how his lord , if he brought him a favourable answer from the lady dulcinea del toboso , was to put himself in the way of endeavouring to become an emperor , or at least a monarch; for it had been so settled between them , and with his personal worth and the might of his arm it was an easy matter to come to be one: and how on becoming one his lord was to make a marriage for him ( for he would be a widower by that time , as a matter of course ) and was to give him as a wife one of the damsels of the empress , the heiress of some rich and grand state on the mainland , having nothing to do with islands of any sort , for he did not care for them now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this sancho delivered with so much composurewiping his nose from time to timeand with so little common - sense that his two hearers were again filled with wonder at the force of don quixote s madness that could run away with this poor man s reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they did not care to take the trouble of disabusing him of his error , as they considered that since it did not in any way hurt his conscience it would be better to leave him in it , and they would have all the more amusement in listening to his simplicities; and so they bade him pray to god for his lord s health , as it was a very likely and a very feasible thing for him in course of time to come to be an emperor , as he said , or at least an archbishop or some other dignitary of equal rank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which sancho made answer ,  - if fortune , sirs , should bring things about in such a way that my master should have a mind , instead of being an emperor , to be an archbishop , i should like to know what archbishops - errant commonly give their squires? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - they commonly give them , said the curate , some simple benefice or cure , or some place as sacristan which brings them a good fixed income , not counting the altar fees , which may be reckoned at as much more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but for that , said sancho ,  - the squire must be unmarried , and must know , at any rate , how to help at mass , and if that be so , woe is me , for i am married already and i don t know the first letter of the a b c . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you speak like a man of sense , said the curate ,  - and you will be acting like a good christian; but what must now be done is to take steps to coax your master out of that useless penance you say he is performing; and we had best turn into this inn to consider what plan to adopt , and also to dine , for it is now time . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho said they might go in , but that he would wait there outside , and that he would tell them afterwards the reason why he was unwilling , and why it did not suit him to enter it; but he begged them to bring him out something to eat , and to let it be hot , and also to bring barley for rocinante . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they left him and went in , and presently the barber brought him out something to eat . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by - and - by , after they had between them carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their object , the curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour don quixote , and effect their purpose; and his notion , which he explained to the barber , was that he himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel , while the other should try as best he could to pass for a squire , and that they should thus proceed to where don quixote was , and he , pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel , should ask a favour of him , which as a valiant knight - errant he could not refuse to grant; and the favour he meant to ask him was that he should accompany her whither she would conduct him , in order to redress a wrong which a wicked knight had done her , while at the same time she should entreat him not to require her to remove her mask , nor ask her any question touching her circumstances until he had righted her with the wicked knight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and he had no doubt that don quixote would comply with any request made in these terms , and that in this way they might remove him and take him to his own village , where they would endeavour to find out if his extraordinary madness admitted of any kind of remedy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curate s plan did not seem a bad one to the barber , but on the contrary so good that they immediately set about putting it in execution . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady , leaving her in pledge a new cassock of the curate s; and the barber made a beard out of a grey - brown or red ox - tail in which the landlord used to stick his comb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlady asked them what they wanted these things for , and the curate told her in a few words about the madness of don quixote , and how this disguise was intended to get him away from the mountain where he then was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlord and landlady immediately came to the conclusion that the madman was their guest , the balsam man and master of the blanketed squire , and they told the curate all that had passed between him and them , not omitting what sancho had been so silent about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they took leave of all , and of the good maritornes , who , sinner as she was , promised to pray a rosary of prayers that god might grant them success in such an arduous and christian undertaking as that they had in hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck the curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion , as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way even though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he begged him to change dresses , as it was fitter he should be the distressed damsel , while he himself would play the squire s part , which would be less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was resolved to have nothing more to do with the matter , and let the devil take don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the barber told him he could manage it properly without any instruction , and as he did not care to dress himself up until they were near where don quixote was , he folded up the garments , and the curate adjusted his beard , and they set out under the guidance of sancho panza , who went along telling them of the encounter with the madman they met in the sierra , saying nothing , however , about the finding of the valise and its contents; for with all his simplicity the lad was a trifle covetous . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day they reached the place where sancho had laid the broom - branches as marks to direct him to where he had left his master , and recognising it he told them that here was the entrance , and that they would do well to dress themselves , if that was required to deliver his master; for they had already told him that going in this guise and dressing in this way were of the highest importance in order to rescue his master from the pernicious life he had adopted; and they charged him strictly not to tell his master who they were , or that he knew them , and should he ask , as ask he would , if he had given the letter to dulcinea , to say that he had , and that , as she did not know how to read , she had given an answer by word of mouth , saying that she commanded him , on pain of her displeasure , to come and see her at once; and it was a very important matter for himself , because in this way and with what they meant to say to him they felt sure of bringing him back to a better mode of life and inducing him to take immediate steps to become an emperor or monarch , for there was no fear of his becoming an archbishop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said , too , that it would be as well for him to go on before them to find him , and give him his lady s answer; for that perhaps might be enough to bring him away from the place without putting them to all this trouble . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was an august day with all the heat of one , and the heat in those parts is intense , and the hour was three in the afternoon , all which made the spot the more inviting and tempted them to wait there for sancho s return , which they did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and still more surprised were they when they perceived that what they heard sung were the verses not of rustic shepherds , but of the polished wits of the city; and so it proved , for the verses they heard were these: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hour , the summer season , the solitary place , the voice and skill of the singer , all contributed to the wonder and delight of the two listeners , who remained still waiting to hear something more; finding , however , that the silence continued some little time , they resolved to go in search of the musician who sang with so fine a voice; but just as they were about to do so they were checked by the same voice , which once more fell upon their ears , singing this<s> <s> the song ended with a deep sigh , and again the listeners remained waiting attentively for the singer to resume; but perceiving that the music had now turned to sobs and heart - rending moans they determined to find out who the unhappy being could be whose voice was as rare as his sighs were piteous , and they had not proceeded far when on turning the corner of a rock they discovered a man of the same aspect and appearance as sancho had described to them when he told them the story of cardenio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cardenio was then in his right mind , free from any attack of that madness which so frequently carried him away , and seeing them dressed in a fashion so unusual among the frequenters of those wilds , could not help showing some surprise , especially when he heard them speak of his case as if it were a well - known matter ( for the curate s words gave him to understand as much ) so he replied to them thus: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i see plainly , sirs , whoever you may be , that heaven , whose care it is to succour the good , and even the wicked very often , here , in this remote spot , cut off from human intercourse , sends me , though i deserve it not , those who seek to draw me away from this to some better retreat , showing me by many and forcible arguments how unreasonably i act in leading the life i do; but as they know , that if i escape from this evil i shall fall into another still greater , perhaps they will set me down as a weak - minded man , or , what is worse , one devoid of reason; nor would it be any wonder , for i myself can perceive that the effect of the recollection of my misfortunes is so great and works so powerfully to my ruin , that in spite of myself i become at times like a stone , without feeling or consciousness; and i come to feel the truth of it when they tell me and show me proofs of the things i have done when the terrible fit overmasters me; and all i can do is bewail my lot in vain , and idly curse my destiny , and plead for my madness by telling how it was caused , to any that care to hear it; for no reasonable beings on learning the cause will wonder at the effects; and if they cannot help me at least they will not blame me , and the repugnance they feel at my wild ways will turn into pity for my woes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if it be , sirs , that you are here with the same design as others have come with , before you proceed with your wise arguments , i entreat you to hear the story of my countless misfortunes , for perhaps when you have heard it you will spare yourselves the trouble you would take in offering consolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as they , both of them , desired nothing more than to hear from his own lips the cause of his suffering , they entreated him to tell it , promising not to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not wish; and thereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly the same words and manner in which he had related it to don quixote and the goatherd a few days before , when , through master elisabad , and don quixote s scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry , the tale was left unfinished , as this history has already recorded; but now fortunately the mad fit kept off , allowed him to tell it to the end; and so , coming to the incident of the note which don fernando had found in the volume of  - amadis of gaul , cardenio said that he remembered it perfectly and that it was in these words: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i told don fernando that all luscinda s father was waiting for was that mine should ask her of him , which i did not dare to suggest to him , fearing that he would not consent to do so; not because he did not know perfectly well the rank , goodness , virtue , and beauty of luscinda , and that she had qualities that would do honour to any family in spain , but because i was aware that he did not wish me to marry so soon , before seeing what the duke ricardo would do for me . </s> </s>

<s> <s> but laying aside these useless and unavailing reflections , let us take up the broken thread of my unhappy story . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to proceed , then: don fernando finding my presence an obstacle to the execution of his treacherous and wicked design , resolved to send me to his elder brother under the pretext of asking money from him to pay for six horses which , purposely , and with the sole object of sending me away that he might the better carry out his infernal scheme , he had purchased the very day he offered to speak to my father , and the price of which he now desired me to fetch . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> could i have anticipated this treachery? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nay; so far from that , i offered with the greatest pleasure to go at once , in my satisfaction at the good bargain that had been made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that night i spoke with luscinda , and told her what had been agreed upon with don fernando , and how i had strong hopes of our fair and reasonable wishes being realised . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she , as unsuspicious as i was of the treachery of don fernando , bade me try to return speedily , as she believed the fulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as my father put off speaking to hers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was astonished at this unusual turn , which i never before observed in her , for we always conversed , whenever good fortune and my ingenuity gave us the chance , with the greatest gaiety and cheerfulness , mingling tears , sighs , jealousies , doubts , or fears with our words; it was all on my part a eulogy of my good fortune that heaven should have given her to me for my mistress; i glorified her beauty , i extolled her worth and her understanding; and she paid me back by praising in me what in her love for me she thought worthy of praise; and besides we had a hundred thousand trifles and doings of our neighbours and acquaintances to talk about , and the utmost extent of my boldness was to take , almost by force , one of her fair white hands and carry it to my lips , as well as the closeness of the low grating that separated us allowed me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last i took my departure , sad and dejected , my heart filled with fancies and suspicions , but not knowing well what it was i suspected or fancied; plain omens pointing to the sad event and misfortune that was awaiting me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i reached the place whither i had been sent , gave the letter to don fernando s brother , and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed , for he desired me to wait , very much against my will , eight days in some place where the duke his father was not likely to see me , as his brother wrote that the money was to be sent without his knowledge; all of which was a scheme of the treacherous don fernando , for his brother had no want of money to enable him to despatch me at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying it , as it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days separated from luscinda , especially after leaving her in the sorrowful mood i have described to you; nevertheless as a dutiful servant i obeyed , though i felt it would be at the cost of my well - being . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i opened it with fear and trepidation , persuaded that it must be something serious that had impelled her to write to me when at a distance , as she seldom did so when i was near . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - all the while the good - natured improvised courier was telling me this , i hung upon his words , my legs trembling under me so that i could scarcely stand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the promise don fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine , he has fulfilled much more to his own satisfaction than to your advantage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have to tell you , seor , that he has demanded me for a wife , and my father , led away by what he considers don fernando s superiority over you , has favoured his suit so cordially , that in two days hence the betrothal is to take place with such secrecy and so privately that the only witnesses are to be the heavens above and a few of the household . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> god grant this may come to your hand before mine shall be forced to link itself with his who keeps so ill the faith that he has pledged . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - such , in brief , were the words of the letter , words that made me set out at once without waiting any longer for reply or money; for i now saw clearly that it was not the purchase of horses but of his own pleasure that had made don fernando send me to his brother . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she recognised me at once , and i her , but not as she ought to have recognised me , or i her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of a truth no one . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be not distressed , my friend , but contrive to be present at this sacrifice , and if that cannot be prevented by my words , i have a dagger concealed which will prevent more deliberate violence , putting an end to my life and giving thee a first proof of the love i have borne and bear thee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  i replied to her distractedly and hastily , in fear lest i should not have time to reply , may thy words be verified by thy deeds , lady; and if thou hast a dagger to save thy honour , i have a sword to defend thee or kill myself if fortune be against us . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - i think she could not have heard all these words , for i perceived that they called her away in haste , as the bridegroom was waiting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now the night of my sorrow set in , the sun of my happiness went down , i felt my eyes bereft of sight , my mind of reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i could not enter the house , nor was i capable of any movement; but reflecting how important it was that i should be present at what might take place on the occasion , i nerved myself as best i could and went in , for i well knew all the entrances and outlets; and besides , with the confusion that in secret pervaded the house no one took notice of me , so , without being seen , i found an opportunity of placing myself in the recess formed by a window of the hall itself , and concealed by the ends and borders of two tapestries , from between which i could , without being seen , see all that took place in the room . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were such as cannot be , nor were it well they should be , told . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suffice it to say that the bridegroom entered the hall in his usual dress , without ornament of any kind; as groomsman he had with him a cousin of luscinda s and except the servants of the house there was no one else in the chamber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> soon afterwards luscinda came out from an antechamber , attended by her mother and two of her damsels , arrayed and adorned as became her rank and beauty , and in full festival and ceremonial attire . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my anxiety and distraction did not allow me to observe or notice particularly what she wore; i could only perceive the colours , which were crimson and white , and the glitter of the gems and jewels on her head dress and apparel , surpassed by the rare beauty of her lovely auburn hair that vying with the precious stones and the light of the four torches that stood in the hall shone with a brighter gleam than all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> why bring before me now the incomparable beauty of that adored enemy of mine? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> were it not better , cruel memory , to remind me and recall what she then did , that stirred by a wrong so glaring i may seek , if not vengeance now , at least to rid myself of life? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> be not weary , sirs , of listening to these digressions; my sorrow is not one of those that can or should be told tersely and briefly , for to me each incident seems to call for many words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to proceed , then , continued cardenio:  - all being assembled in the hall , the priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the hand to perform the requisite ceremony , at the words , will you , seora luscinda , take seor don fernando , here present , for your lawful husband , as the holy mother church ordains?   i thrust my head and neck out from between the tapestries , and with eager ears and throbbing heart set myself to listen to luscinda s answer , awaiting in her reply the sentence of death or the grant of life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> oh , that i had but dared at that moment to rush forward crying aloud , luscinda , luscinda! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> have a care what thou dost; remember what thou owest me; bethink thee thou art mine and canst not be another s; reflect that thy utterance of  - yes and the end of my life will come at the same instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> o , treacherous don fernando! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> robber of my glory , death of my life! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> remember that thou canst not as a christian attain the object of thy wishes , for luscinda is my bride , and i am her husband!   fool that i am! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> now that i am far away , and out of danger , i say i should have done what i did not do: now that i have allowed my precious treasure to be robbed from me , i curse the robber , on whom i might have taken vengeance had i as much heart for it as i have for bewailing my fate; in short , as i was then a coward and a fool , little wonder is it if i am now dying shame - stricken , remorseful , and mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the priest stood waiting for the answer of luscinda , who for a long time withheld it; and just as i thought she was taking out the dagger to save her honour , or struggling for words to make some declaration of the truth on my behalf , i heard her say in a faint and feeble voice , i will:  don fernando said the same , and giving her the ring they stood linked by a knot that could never be loosed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the bridegroom then approached to embrace his bride; and she , pressing her hand upon her heart , fell fainting in her mother s arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it only remains now for me to tell you the state i was in when in that consent that i heard i saw all my hopes mocked , the words and promises of luscinda proved falsehoods , and the recovery of the prize i had that instant lost rendered impossible for ever . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i stood stupefied , wholly abandoned , it seemed , by heaven , declared the enemy of the earth that bore me , the air refusing me breath for my sighs , the water moisture for my tears; it was only the fire that gathered strength so that my whole frame glowed with rage and jealousy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as he had read it he seated himself in a chair , leaning his cheek on his hand in the attitude of one deep in thought , without taking any part in the efforts that were being made to recover his bride from her fainting fit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - seeing all the household in confusion , i ventured to come out regardless whether i were seen or not , and determined , if i were , to do some frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous indignation of my breast in the punishment of the treacherous don fernando , and even in that of the fickle fainting traitress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but my fate , doubtless reserving me for greater sorrows , if such there be , so ordered it that just then i had enough and to spare of that reason which has since been wanting to me; and so , without seeking to take vengeance on my greatest enemies ( which might have been easily taken , as all thought of me was so far from their minds ) , i resolved to take it upon myself , and on myself to inflict the pain they deserved , perhaps with even greater severity than i should have dealt out to them had i then slain them; for sudden pain is soon over , but that which is protracted by tortures is ever slaying without ending life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in a word , i quitted the house and reached that of the man with whom i had left my mule; i made him saddle it for me , mounted without bidding him farewell , and rode out of the city , like another lot , not daring to turn my head to look back upon it; and when i found myself alone in the open country , screened by the darkness of the night , and tempted by the stillness to give vent to my grief without apprehension or fear of being heard or seen , then i broke silence and lifted up my voice in maledictions upon luscinda and don fernando , as if i could thus avenge the wrong they had done me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i called her cruel , ungrateful , false , thankless , but above all covetous , since the wealth of my enemy had blinded the eyes of her affection , and turned it from me to transfer it to one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet , in the midst of this outburst of execration and upbraiding , i found excuses for her , saying it was no wonder that a young girl in the seclusion of her parents  house , trained and schooled to obey them always , should have been ready to yield to their wishes when they offered her for a husband a gentleman of such distinction , wealth , and noble birth , that if she had refused to accept him she would have been thought out of her senses , or to have set her affection elsewhere , a suspicion injurious to her fair name and fame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but then again , i said , had she declared i was her husband , they would have seen that in choosing me she had not chosen so ill but that they might excuse her , for before don fernando had made his offer , they themselves could not have desired , if their desires had been ruled by reason , a more eligible husband for their daughter than i was; and she , before taking the last fatal step of giving her hand , might easily have said that i had already given her mine , for i should have come forward to support any assertion of hers to that effect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , i came to the conclusion that feeble love , little reflection , great ambition , and a craving for rank , had made her forget the words with which she had deceived me , encouraged and supported by my firm hopes and honourable passion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thus soliloquising and agitated , i journeyed onward for the remainder of the night , and by daybreak i reached one of the passes of these mountains , among which i wandered for three days more without taking any path or road , until i came to some meadows lying on i know not which side of the mountains , and there i inquired of some herdsmen in what direction the most rugged part of the range lay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they told me that it was in this quarter , and i at once directed my course hither , intending to end my life here; but as i was making my way among these crags , my mule dropped dead through fatigue and hunger , or , as i think more likely , in order to have done with such a worthless burden as it bore in me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i was left on foot , worn out , famishing , without anyone to help me or any thought of seeking help: and so thus i lay stretched on the ground , how long i know not , after which i rose up free from hunger , and found beside me some goatherds , who no doubt were the persons who had relieved me in my need , for they told me how they had found me , and how i had been uttering ravings that showed plainly i had lost my reason; and since then i am conscious that i am not always in full possession of it , but at times so deranged and crazed that i do a thousand mad things , tearing my clothes , crying aloud in these solitudes , cursing my fate , and idly calling on the dear name of her who is my enemy , and only seeking to end my life in lamentation; and when i recover my senses i find myself so exhausted and weary that i can scarcely move . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> most commonly my dwelling is the hollow of a cork tree large enough to shelter this miserable body; the herdsmen and goatherds who frequent these mountains , moved by compassion , furnish me with food , leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks , where they think i may perhaps pass and find it; and so , even though i may be then out of my senses , the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustain me , and make me crave it and eager to take it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at other times , so they tell me when they find me in a rational mood , i sally out upon the road , and though they would gladly give it me , i snatch food by force from the shepherds bringing it from the village to their huts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - such , sirs , is the dismal story of my misfortune: say if it be one that can be told with less emotion than you have seen in me; and do not trouble yourselves with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggests as likely to serve for my relief , for it will avail me as much as the medicine prescribed by a wise physician avails the sick man who will not take it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> here cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story , as full of misfortune as it was of love; but just as the curate was going to address some words of comfort to him , he was stopped by a voice that reached his ear , saying in melancholy tones what will be told in the fourth part of this narrative; for at this point the sage and sagacious historian , cid hamete benengeli , brought the third to a conclusion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> happy and fortunate were the times when that most daring knight don quixote of la mancha was sent into the world; for by reason of his having formed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to revive and restore to the world the long - lost and almost defunct order of knight - errantry , we now enjoy in this age of ours , so poor in light entertainment , not only the charm of his veracious history , but also of the tales and episodes contained in it which are , in a measure , no less pleasing , ingenious , and truthful , than the history itself; which , resuming its thread , carded , spun , and wound , relates that just as the curate was going to offer consolation to cardenio , he was interrupted by a voice that fell upon his ear saying in plaintive tones: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is it possible i have found a place that may serve as a secret grave for the weary load of this body that i support so unwillingly? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if the solitude these mountains promise deceives me not , it is so; ah! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him , and as it seemed to them to be uttered close by , as indeed it was , they got up to look for the speaker , and before they had gone twenty paces they discovered behind a rock , seated at the foot of an ash tree , a youth in the dress of a peasant , whose face they were unable at the moment to see as he was leaning forward , bathing his feet in the brook that flowed past . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they approached so silently that he did not perceive them , being fully occupied in bathing his feet , which were so fair that they looked like two pieces of shining crystal brought forth among the other stones of the brook . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them with surprise , for they did not seem to have been made to crush clods or to follow the plough and the oxen as their owner s dress suggested; and so , finding they had not been noticed , the curate , who was in front , made a sign to the other two to conceal themselves behind some fragments of rock that lay there; which they did , observing closely what the youth was about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the youth then took off the montera , and shaking his head from side to side there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams of the sun might have envied; by this they knew that what had seemed a peasant was a lovely woman , nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of them had ever beheld , or even cardenio s if they had not seen and known luscinda , for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of luscinda could compare with this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the long auburn tresses not only covered her shoulders , but such was their length and abundance , concealed her all round beneath their masses , so that except the feet nothing of her form was visible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she now used her hands as a comb , and if her feet had seemed like bits of crystal in the water , her hands looked like pieces of driven snow among her locks; all which increased not only the admiration of the three beholders , but their anxiety to learn who she was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this object they resolved to show themselves , and at the stir they made in getting upon their feet the fair damsel raised her head , and parting her hair from before her eyes with both hands , she looked to see who had made the noise , and the instant she perceived them she started to her feet , and without waiting to put on her shoes or gather up her hair , hastily snatched up a bundle as though of clothes that she had beside her , and , scared and alarmed , endeavoured to take flight; but before she had gone six paces she fell to the ground , her delicate feet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones; seeing which , the three hastened towards her , and the curate addressing her first said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - stay , seora , whoever you may be , for those whom you see here only desire to be of service to you; you have no need to attempt a flight so heedless , for neither can your feet bear it , nor we allow it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they , however , came towards her , and the curate taking her hand went on to say: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what your dress would hide , seora , is made known to us by your hair; a clear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised your beauty in a garb so unworthy of it , and sent it into solitudes like these where we have had the good fortune to find you , if not to relieve your distress , at least to offer you comfort; for no distress , so long as life lasts , can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make the sufferer refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while the curate was speaking , the disguised damsel stood as if spell - bound , looking at them without opening her lips or uttering a word , just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he has never seen before has been suddenly shown; but on the curate addressing some further words to the same effect to her , sighing deeply she broke silence and said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me , and the escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to deal in falsehoods , it would be idle for me now to make any further pretence of what , if you were to believe me , you would believe more out of courtesy than for any other reason . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this being so , i say i thank you , sirs , for the offer you have made me , which places me under the obligation of complying with the request you have made of me; though i fear the account i shall give you of my misfortunes will excite in you as much concern as compassion , for you will be unable to suggest anything to remedy them or any consolation to alleviate them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , that my honour may not be left a matter of doubt in your minds , now that you have discovered me to be a woman , and see that i am young , alone , and in this dress , things that taken together or separately would be enough to destroy any good name , i feel bound to tell what i would willingly keep secret if i could . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without any hesitation , with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they were not less charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty , and as they again repeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil her promise , she without further pressing , first modestly covering her feet and gathering up her hair , seated herself on a stone with the three placed around her , and , after an effort to restrain some tears that came to her eyes , in a clear and steady voice began her story thus: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my parents are this lord s vassals , lowly in origin , but so wealthy that if birth had conferred as much on them as fortune , they would have had nothing left to desire , nor should i have had reason to fear trouble like that in which i find myself now; for it may be that my ill fortune came of theirs in not having been nobly born . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they are , in short , peasants , plain homely people , without any taint of disreputable blood , and , as the saying is , old rusty christians , but so rich that by their wealth and free - handed way of life they are coming by degrees to be considered gentlefolk by birth , and even by position; though the wealth and nobility they thought most of was having me for their daughter; and as they have no other child to make their heir , and are affectionate parents , i was one of the most indulged daughters that ever parents indulged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such was the life i led in my parents  house and if i have depicted it thus minutely , it is not out of ostentation , or to let you know that i am rich , but that you may see how , without any fault of mine , i have fallen from the happy condition i have described , to the misery i am in at present . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moment the speaker mentioned the name of don fernando , cardenio changed colour and broke into a sweat , with such signs of emotion that the curate and the barber , who observed it , feared that one of the mad fits which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him; but cardenio showed no further agitation and remained quiet , regarding the peasant girl with fixed attention , for he began to suspect who she was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she , however , without noticing the excitement of cardenio , continuing her story , went on to say: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but to shorten the long recital of my woes , i will pass over in silence all the artifices employed by don fernando for declaring his passion for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he bribed all the household , he gave and offered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was like a holiday or a merry - making in our street; by night no one could sleep for the music; the love letters that used to come to my hand , no one knew how , were innumerable , full of tender pleadings and pledges , containing more promises and oaths than there were letters in them; all which not only did not soften me , but hardened my heart against him , as if he had been my mortal enemy , and as if everything he did to make me yield were done with the opposite intention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they told me they trusted and confided their honour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone , and bade me consider the disparity between don fernando and myself , from which i might conclude that his intentions , whatever he might say to the contrary , had for their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage; and if i were at all desirous of opposing an obstacle to his unreasonable suit , they were ready , they said , to marry me at once to anyone i preferred , either among the leading people of our own town , or of any of those in the neighbourhood; for with their wealth and my good name , a match might be looked for in any quarter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this offer , and their sound advice strengthened my resolution , and i never gave don fernando a word in reply that could hold out to him any hope of success , however remote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all this caution of mine , which he must have taken for coyness , had apparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetitefor that is the name i give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it to be , you would not know of it now , because there would have been no occasion to tell you of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i had no power to utter a cry , nor , i think , did he give me time to utter one , as he immediately approached me , and taking me in his arms ( for , overwhelmed as i was , i was powerless , i say , to help myself ) , he began to make such professions to me that i know not how falsehood could have had the power of dressing them up to seem so like truth; and the traitor contrived that his tears should vouch for his words , and his sighs for his sincerity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am your vassal , but i am not your slave; your nobility neither has nor should have any right to dishonour or degrade my humble birth; and low - born peasant as i am , i have my self - respect as much as you , a lord and gentleman: with me your violence will be to no purpose , your wealth will have no weight , your words will have no power to deceive me , nor your sighs or tears to soften me: were i to see any of the things i speak of in him whom my parents gave me as a husband , his will should be mine , and mine should be bounded by his; and my honour being preserved even though my inclinations were not would willingly yield him what you , seor , would now obtain by force; and this i say lest you should suppose that any but my lawful husband shall ever win anything of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  if that ,  said this disloyal gentleman , be the only scruple you feel , fairest dorothea  ( for that is the name of this unhappy being ) , see here i give you my hand to be yours , and let heaven , from which nothing is hid , and this image of our lady you have here , be witnesses of this pledge . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> when cardenio heard her say she was called dorothea , he showed fresh agitation and felt convinced of the truth of his former suspicion , but he was unwilling to interrupt the story , and wished to hear the end of what he already all but knew , so he merely said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but proceed; by - and - by i may tell you something that will astonish you as much as it will excite your compassion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea was struck by cardenio s words as well as by his strange and miserable attire , and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to tell it to her at once , for if fortune had left her any blessing it was courage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her , as she felt sure that none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she endured already . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i would not let the occasion pass , seora , replied cardenio ,  - of telling you what i think , if what i suspect were the truth , but so far there has been no opportunity , nor is it of any importance to you to know it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be it as it may , replied dorothea ,  - what happened in my story was that don fernando , taking an image that stood in the chamber , placed it as a witness of our betrothal , and with the most binding words and extravagant oaths gave me his promise to become my husband; though before he had made an end of pledging himself i bade him consider well what he was doing , and think of the anger his father would feel at seeing him married to a peasant girl and one of his vassals; i told him not to let my beauty , such as it was , blind him , for that was not enough to furnish an excuse for his transgression; and if in the love he bore me he wished to do me any kindness , it would be to leave my lot to follow its course at the level my condition required; for marriages so unequal never brought happiness , nor did they continue long to afford the enjoyment they began with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all this that i have now repeated i said to him , and much more which i cannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his purpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself about difficulties when he is striking the bargain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time i argued the matter briefly in my own mind , saying to myself , i shall not be the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty station , nor will don fernando be the first whom beauty or , as is more likely , a blind attachment , has led to mate himself below his rank . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , since i am introducing no new usage or practice , i may as well avail myself of the honour that chance offers me , for even though his inclination for me should not outlast the attainment of his wishes , i shall be , after all , his wife before god . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and if i strive to repel him by scorn , i can see that , fair means failing , he is in a mood to use force , and i shall be left dishonoured and without any means of proving my innocence to those who cannot know how innocently i have come to be in this position; for what arguments would persuade my parents that this gentleman entered my chamber without my consent?  <s> <s>  - all these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment; but the oaths of don fernando , the witnesses he appealed to , the tears he shed , and lastly the charms of his person and his high - bred grace , which , accompanied by such signs of genuine love , might well have conquered a heart even more free and coy than minethese were the things that more than all began to influence me and lead me unawares to my ruin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i called my waiting - maid to me , that there might be a witness on earth besides those in heaven , and again don fernando renewed and repeated his oaths , invoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition to the former ones , called down upon himself a thousand curses hereafter should he fail to keep his promise , shed more tears , redoubled his sighs and pressed me closer in his arms , from which he had never allowed me to escape; and so i was left by my maid , and ceased to be one , and he became a traitor and a perjured man . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so quickly , i imagine , as don fernando wished , for when desire has attained its object , the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of pleasure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i say so because don fernando made all haste to leave me , and by the adroitness of my maid , who was indeed the one who had admitted him , gained the street before daybreak; but on taking leave of me he told me , though not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he came , that i might rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and sincerity of his oaths; and to confirm his words he drew a rich ring off his finger and placed it upon mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then took his departure and i was left , i know not whether sorrowful or happy; all i can say is , i was left agitated and troubled in mind and almost bewildered by what had taken place , and i had not the spirit , or else it did not occur to me , to chide my maid for the treachery she had been guilty of in concealing don fernando in my chamber; for as yet i was unable to make up my mind whether what had befallen me was for good or evil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i remember well how sad and dreary those days and hours were to me; i remember well how i began to doubt as they went by , and even to lose confidence in the faith of don fernando; and i remember , too , how my maid heard those words in reproof of her audacity that she had not heard before , and how i was forced to put a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my countenance , not to give my parents cause to ask me why i was so melancholy , and drive me to invent falsehoods in reply . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but all this was suddenly brought to an end , for the time came when all such considerations were disregarded , and there was no further question of honour , when my patience gave way and the secret of my heart became known abroad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the reason was , that a few days later it was reported in the town that don fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of rare beauty , the daughter of parents of distinguished position , though not so rich that her portion would entitle her to look for so brilliant a match; it was said , too , that her name was luscinda , and that at the betrothal some strange things had happened . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cardenio heard the name of luscinda , but he only shrugged his shoulders , bit his lips , bent his brows , and before long two streams of tears escaped from his eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea , however , did not interrupt her story , but went on in these words: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this sad intelligence reached my ears , and , instead of being struck with a chill , with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that i scarcely restrained myself from rushing out into the streets , crying aloud and proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which i was the victim; but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a resolution i formed , to be carried out the same night , and that was to assume this dress , which i got from a servant of my father s , one of the zagals , as they are called in farmhouses , to whom i confided the whole of my misfortune , and whom i entreated to accompany me to the city where i heard my enemy was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he , though he remonstrated with me for my boldness , and condemned my resolution , when he saw me bent upon my purpose , offered to bear me company , as he said , to the end of the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i at once packed up in a linen pillow - case a woman s dress , and some jewels and money to provide for emergencies , and in the silence of the night , without letting my treacherous maid know , i sallied forth from the house , accompanied by my servant and abundant anxieties , and on foot set out for the city , but borne as it were on wings by my eagerness to reach it , if not to prevent what i presumed to be already done , at least to call upon don fernando to tell me with what conscience he had done it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i reached my destination in two days and a half , and on entering the city inquired for the house of luscinda s parents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said that on the night of don fernando s betrothal with luscinda , as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying yes ,  she was taken with a sudden fainting fit , and that on the bridegroom approaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air , he found a paper in her own handwriting , in which she said and declared that she could not be don fernando s bride , because she was already cardenio s , who , according to the man s account , was a gentleman of distinction of the same city; and that if she had accepted don fernando , it was only in obedience to her parents . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , he said , the words of the paper made it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the betrothal , and gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which was confirmed , it was said , by a dagger they found somewhere in her clothes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on seeing this , don fernando , persuaded that luscinda had befooled , slighted , and trifled with him , assailed her before she had recovered from her swoon , and tried to stab her with the dagger that had been found , and would have succeeded had not her parents and those who were present prevented him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was said , moreover , that don fernando went away at once , and that luscinda did not recover from her prostration until the next day , when she told her parents how she was really the bride of that cardenio i have mentioned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this was a matter of notoriety in the city , and everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that luscinda was missing from her father s house and from the city , for she was not to be found anywhere , to the distraction of her parents , who knew not what steps to take to recover her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what i learned revived my hopes , and i was better pleased not to have found don fernando than to find him married , for it seemed to me that the door was not yet entirely shut upon relief in my case , and i thought that perhaps heaven had put this impediment in the way of the second marriage , to lead him to recognise his obligations under the former one , and reflect that as a christian he was bound to consider his soul above all human objects . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but while i was in the city , uncertain what to do , as i could not find don fernando , i heard notice given by the public crier offering a great reward to anyone who should find me , and giving the particulars of my age and of the very dress i wore; and i heard it said that the lad who came with me had taken me away from my father s house; a thing that cut me to the heart , showing how low my good name had fallen , since it was not enough that i should lose it by my flight , but they must add with whom i had fled , and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my consideration . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the instant i heard the notice i quitted the city with my servant , who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to me , and the same night , for fear of discovery , we entered the most thickly wooded part of these mountains . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , as is commonly said , one evil calls up another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the beginning of one still greater , and so it proved in my case; for my worthy servant , until then so faithful and trusty when he found me in this lonely spot , moved more by his own villainy than by my beauty , sought to take advantage of the opportunity which these solitudes seemed to present him , and with little shame and less fear of god and respect for me , began to make overtures to me; and finding that i replied to the effrontery of his proposals with justly severe language , he laid aside the entreaties which he had employed at first , and began to use violence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but just heaven , that seldom fails to watch over and aid good intentions , so aided mine that with my slight strength and with little exertion i pushed him over a precipice , where i left him , whether dead or alive i know not; and then , with greater speed than seemed possible in my terror and fatigue , i made my way into the mountains , without any other thought or purpose save that of hiding myself among them , and escaping my father and those despatched in search of me by his orders . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is now i know not how many months since with this object i came here , where i met a herdsman who engaged me as his servant at a place in the heart of this sierra , and all this time i have been serving him as herd , striving to keep always afield to hide these locks which have now unexpectedly betrayed me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but all my care and pains were unavailing , for my master made the discovery that i was not a man , and harboured the same base designs as my servant; and as fortune does not always supply a remedy in cases of difficulty , and i had no precipice or ravine at hand down which to fling the master and cure his passion , as i had in the servant s case , i thought it a lesser evil to leave him and again conceal myself among these crags , than make trial of my strength and argument with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all i ask of you is , what you may easily and reasonably do , to show me where i may pass my life unharassed by the fear and dread of discovery by those who are in search of me; for though the great love my parents bear me makes me feel sure of being kindly received by them , so great is my feeling of shame at the mere thought that i cannot present myself before them as they expect , that i had rather banish myself from their sight for ever than look them in the face with the reflection that they beheld mine stripped of that purity they had a right to expect in me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with these words she became silent , and the colour that overspread her face showed plainly the pain and shame she was suffering at heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea was astonished at hearing her father s name , and at the miserable appearance of him who mentioned it , for it has been already said how wretchedly clad cardenio was; so she said to him: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and who may you be , brother , who seem to know my father s name so well? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for so far , if i remember rightly , i have not mentioned it in the whole story of my misfortunes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy , i entreat you , seora , to form new resolutions in your better mind , as i mean to do in mine , preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes; for i swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a christian not to desert you until i see you in possession of don fernando , and if i cannot by words induce him to recognise his obligation to you , in that case to avail myself of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me , and with just cause challenge him on account of the injury he has done you , not regarding my own wrongs , which i shall leave to heaven to avenge , while i on earth devote myself to yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he also explained to them in a few words the object that had brought them there , and the strange nature of don quixote s madness , and how they were waiting for his squire , who had gone in search of him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> like the recollection of a dream , the quarrel he had had with don quixote came back to cardenio s memory , and he described it to the others; but he was unable to say what the dispute was about . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment they heard a shout , and recognised it as coming from sancho panza , who , not finding them where he had left them , was calling aloud to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the licentiate in reply told him not to be uneasy , for they would fetch him away in spite of himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he then told cardenio and dorothea what they had proposed to do to cure don quixote , or at any rate take him home; upon which dorothea said that she could play the distressed damsel better than the barber; especially as she had there the dress in which to do it to the life , and that they might trust to her acting the part in every particular requisite for carrying out their scheme , for she had read a great many books of chivalry , and knew exactly the style in which afflicted damsels begged boons of knights - errant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in that case , said the curate ,  - there is nothing more required than to set about it at once , for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itself in our favour , since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for your relief , and smoothed the way for us to our object . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were all highly delighted with her grace , air , and beauty , and declared don fernando to be a man of very little taste when he rejected such charms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the one who admired her most was sancho panza , for it seemed to him ( what indeed was true ) that in all the days of his life he had never seen such a lovely creature; and he asked the curate with great eagerness who this beautiful lady was , and what she wanted in these out - of - the - way quarters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - this fair lady , brother sancho , replied the curate ,  - is no less a personage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom of micomicon , who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of him , which is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has done her; and from the fame as a good knight which your master has acquired far and wide , this princess has come from guinea to seek him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a lucky seeking and a lucky finding! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said sancho panza at this;  - especially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury , and right that wrong , and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your worship speaks of; as kill him he will if he meets him , unless , indeed , he happens to be a phantom; for my master has no power at all against phantoms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but one thing among others i would beg of you , seor licentiate , which is , that , to prevent my master taking a fancy to be an archbishop , for that is what i m afraid of , your worship would recommend him to marry this princess at once; for in this way he will be disabled from taking archbishop s orders , and will easily come into his empire , and i to the end of my desires; i have been thinking over the matter carefully , and by what i can make out i find it will not do for me that my master should become an archbishop , because i am no good for the church , as i am married; and for me now , having as i have a wife and children , to set about obtaining dispensations to enable me to hold a place of profit under the church , would be endless work; so that , seor , it all turns on my master marrying this lady at oncefor as yet i do not know her grace , and so i cannot call her by her name . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there s no doubt of that , replied sancho ,  - for i have known many to take their name and title from the place where they were born and call themselves pedro of alcala , juan of ubeda , and diego of valladolid; and it may be that over there in guinea queens have the same way of taking the names of their kingdoms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so it may , said the curate;  - and as for your master s marrying , i will do all in my power towards it: with which sancho was as much pleased as the curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a hold the absurdities of his master had taken of his fancy , for he had evidently persuaded himself that he was going to be an emperor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by this time dorothea had seated herself upon the curate s mule , and the barber had fitted the ox - tail beard to his face , and they now told sancho to conduct them to where don quixote was , warning him not to say that he knew either the licentiate or the barber , as his master s becoming an emperor entirely depended on his not recognising them; neither the curate nor cardenio , however , thought fit to go with them; cardenio lest he should remind don quixote of the quarrel he had with him , and the curate as there was no necessity for his presence just yet , so they allowed the others to go on before them , while they themselves followed slowly on foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curate did not forget to instruct dorothea how to act , but she said they might make their minds easy , as everything would be done exactly as the books of chivalry required and described . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - from this spot i will not rise , valiant and doughty knight , until your goodness and courtesy grant me a boon , which will redound to the honour and renown of your person and render a service to the most disconsolate and afflicted damsel the sun has seen; and if the might of your strong arm corresponds to the repute of your immortal fame , you are bound to aid the helpless being who , led by the savour of your renowned name , hath come from far distant lands to seek your aid in her misfortunes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will not rise , seor , answered the afflicted damsel ,  - unless of your courtesy the boon i ask is first granted me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i grant and accord it , said don quixote ,  - provided without detriment or prejudice to my king , my country , or her who holds the key of my heart and freedom , it may be complied with . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them , my worthy lord , said the afflicted damsel; and here sancho panza drew close to his master s ear and said to him very softly ,  - your worship may very safely grant the boon she asks; it s nothing at all; only to kill a big giant; and she who asks it is the exalted princess micomicona , queen of the great kingdom of micomicon of ethiopia . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let her be who she may , replied don quixote ,  - i will do what is my bounden duty , and what my conscience bids me , in conformity with what i have professed; and turning to the damsel he said ,  - let your great beauty rise , for i grant the boon which you would ask of me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i repeat that i grant it , replied don quixote;  - and so , lady , you may from this day forth lay aside the melancholy that distresses you , and let your failing hopes gather new life and strength , for with the help of god and of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to your kingdom , and seated upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm , notwithstanding and despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and now hands to the work , for in delay there is apt to be danger . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his hands; but don quixote , who was in all things a polished and courteous knight , would by no means allow it , but made her rise and embraced her with great courtesy and politeness , and ordered sancho to look to rocinante s girths , and to arm him without a moment s delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho took down the armour , which was hung up on a tree like a trophy , and having seen to the girths armed his master in a trice , who as soon as he found himself in his armour exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us be gone in the name of god to bring aid to this great lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the barber was all this time on his knees at great pains to hide his laughter and not let his beard fall , for had it fallen maybe their fine scheme would have come to nothing; but now seeing the boon granted , and the promptitude with which don quixote prepared to set out in compliance with it , he rose and took his lady s hand , and between them they placed her upon the mule . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he bore all with cheerfulness , being persuaded that his master had now fairly started and was just on the point of becoming an emperor; for he felt no doubt at all that he would marry this princess , and be king of micomicon at least . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what more have i to do than make a cargo of them and carry them to spain , where i can sell them and get ready money for them , and with it buy some title or some office in which to live at ease all the days of my life? </s> </s>

<s> <s> by god i will stir them up , big and little , or as best i can , and let them be ever so black i ll turn them into white or yellow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cardenio and the curate were watching all this from among some bushes , not knowing how to join company with the others; but the curate , who was very fertile in devices , soon hit upon a way of effecting their purpose , and with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut off cardenio s beard , and putting on him a grey jerkin of his own he gave him a black cloak , leaving himself in his breeches and doublet , while cardenio s appearance was so different from what it had been that he would not have known himself had he seen himself in a mirror . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> having effected this , although the others had gone on ahead while they were disguising themselves , they easily came out on the high road before them , for the brambles and awkward places they encountered did not allow those on horseback to go as fast as those on foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , however , the curate would not allow , on which don quixote said ,  - permit me , seor licentiate , for it is not fitting that i should be on horseback and so reverend a person as your worship on foot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - on no account will i allow it , said the curate;  - your mightiness must remain on horseback , for it is on horseback you achieve the greatest deeds and adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me , an unworthy priest , it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches of one of the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship , if they have no objection , and i will fancy i am mounted on the steed pegasus , or on the zebra or charger that bore the famous moor , muzaraque , who to this day lies enchanted in the great hill of zulema , a little distance from the great complutum . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nor even that will i consent to , seor licentiate , answered don quixote ,  - and i know it will be the good pleasure of my lady the princess , out of love for me , to order her squire to give up the saddle of his mule to your worship , and he can sit behind if the beast will bear it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it will , i am sure , said the princess ,  - and i am sure , too , that i need not order my squire , for he is too courteous and considerate to allow a churchman to go on foot when he might be mounted . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the curate , seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme , at once pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where master nicholas lay , still uttering moans , and drawing his head to his breast had it on in an instant , muttering over him some words which he said were a certain special charm for sticking on beards , as they would see; and as soon as he had it fixed he left him , and the squire appeared well bearded and whole as before , whereat don quixote was beyond measure astonished , and begged the curate to teach him that charm when he had an opportunity , as he was persuaded its virtue must extend beyond the sticking on of beards , for it was clear that where the beard had been stripped off the flesh must have remained torn and lacerated , and when it could heal all that it must be good for more than beards . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they then agreed that for the present the curate should mount , and that the three should ride by turns until they reached the inn , which might be about six leagues from where they were . </s> </s>

<s> <s> is it perchance towards that of micomicon? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she , being ready on all points , understood that she was to answer  - yes , so she said  - yes , seor , my way lies towards that kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - your worship is mistaken , seor , said she;  - for it is not two years since i set out from it , and though i never had good weather , nevertheless i am here to behold what i so longed for , and that is my lord don quixote of la mancha , whose fame came to my ears as soon as i set foot in spain and impelled me to go in search of him , to commend myself to his courtesy , and entrust the justice of my cause to the might of his invincible arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will only say , seora , that whether it has might or not , that which it may or may not have shall be devoted to your service even to death; and now , leaving this to its proper season , i would ask the seor licentiate to tell me what it is that has brought him into these parts , alone , unattended , and so lightly clad that i am filled with amazement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will answer that briefly , replied the curate;  - you must know then , seor don quixote , that master nicholas , our friend and barber , and i were going to seville to receive some money that a relative of mine who went to the indies many years ago had sent me , and not such a small sum but that it was over sixty thousand pieces of eight , full weight , which is something; and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked by four footpads , who stripped us even to our beards , and them they stripped off so that the barber found it necessary to put on a false one , and even this young man herepointing to cardenio - they completely transformed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the best of it is , the story goes in the neighbourhood that those who attacked us belong to a number of galley slaves who , they say , were set free almost on the very same spot by a man of such valour that , in spite of the commissary and of the guards , he released the whole of them; and beyond all doubt he must have been out of his senses , or he must be as great a scoundrel as they , or some man without heart or conscience to let the wolf loose among the sheep , the fox among the hens , the fly among the honey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he has defrauded justice , and opposed his king and lawful master , for he opposed his just commands; he has , i say , robbed the galleys of their feet , stirred up the holy brotherhood which for many years past has been quiet , and , lastly , has done a deed by which his soul may be lost without any gain to his body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho had told the curate and the barber of the adventure of the galley slaves , which , so much to his glory , his master had achieved , and hence the curate in alluding to it made the most of it to see what would be said or done by don quixote; who changed colour at every word , not daring to say that it was he who had been the liberator of those worthy people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - these , then , said the curate ,  - were they who robbed us; and god in his mercy pardon him who would not let them go to the punishment they deserved . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curate had hardly ceased speaking , when sancho said ,  - in faith , then , seor licentiate , he who did that deed was my master; and it was not for want of my telling him beforehand and warning him to mind what he was about , and that it was a sin to set them at liberty , as they were all on the march there because they were special scoundrels . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - blockhead! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote at this ,  - it is no business or concern of knights - errant to inquire whether any persons in affliction , in chains , or oppressed that they may meet on the high roads go that way and suffer as they do because of their faults or because of their misfortunes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it only concerns them to aid them as persons in need of help , having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i encountered a chaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate people , and did for them what my sense of duty demands of me , and as for the rest be that as it may; and whoever takes objection to it , saving the sacred dignity of the seor licentiate and his honoured person , i say he knows little about chivalry and lies like a whoreson villain , and this i will give him to know to the fullest extent with my sword; and so saying he settled himself in his stirrups and pressed down his morion; for the barber s basin , which according to him was mambrino s helmet , he carried hanging at the saddle - bow until he could repair the damage done to it by the galley slaves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea , who was shrewd and sprightly , and by this time thoroughly understood don quixote s crazy turn , and that all except sancho panza were making game of him , not to be behind the rest said to him , on observing his irritation ,  - sir knight , remember the boon you have promised me , and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any other adventure , be it ever so pressing; calm yourself , for if the licentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that unconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over , or even bitten his tongue three times before he would have said a word that tended towards disrespect of your worship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i will hold my peace , seora , said don quixote ,  - and i will curb the natural anger that had arisen in my breast , and will proceed in peace and quietness until i have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this consideration i entreat you to tell me , if you have no objection to do so , what is the nature of your trouble , and how many , who , and what are the persons of whom i am to require due satisfaction , and on whom i am to take vengeance on your behalf? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it will not be wearisome , seora , said don quixote; to which dorothea replied ,  - well , if that be so , give me your attention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as she said this , cardenio and the barber drew close to her side , eager to hear what sort of story the quick - witted dorothea would invent for herself; and sancho did the same , for he was as much taken in by her as his master; and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle , and with the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to think , began with great sprightliness of manner in this fashion . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - that is enough , said dorothea ,  - for with friends we must not look too closely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the backbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole , be it where it may , for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the truth in every particular , and i have made a lucky hit in commending myself to don quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of , as the features of his countenance correspond with those assigned to this knight by that wide fame he has acquired not only in spain but in all la mancha; for i had scarcely landed at osuna when i heard such accounts of his achievements , that at once my heart told me he was the very one i had come in search of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but how did you land at osuna , seora , asked don quixote ,  - when it is not a seaport? </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - will your majesty please proceed? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is no more to add , said dorothea ,  - save that in finding don quixote i have had such good fortune , that i already reckon and regard myself queen and mistress of my entire dominions , since of his courtesy and magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying me whithersoever i may conduct him , which will be only to bring him face to face with pandafilando of the scowl , that he may slay him and restore to me what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this must come to pass satisfactorily since my good father tinacrio the sapient foretold it , who likewise left it declared in writing in chaldee or greek characters ( for i cannot read them ) , that if this predicted knight , after having cut the giant s throat , should be disposed to marry me i was to offer myself at once without demur as his lawful wife , and yield him possession of my kingdom together with my person . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote at this . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and so saying he cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign of extreme satisfaction , and then ran to seize the bridle of dorothea s mule , and checking it fell on his knees before her , begging her to give him her hand to kiss in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queen and mistress . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> which of the bystanders could have helped laughing to see the madness of the master and the simplicity of the servant? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea therefore gave her hand , and promised to make him a great lord in her kingdom , when heaven should be so good as to permit her to recover and enjoy it , for which sancho returned thanks in words that set them all laughing again . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the last words of his master about not wanting to marry were so disagreeable to sancho that raising his voice he exclaimed with great irritation: </s> </s>

<s> <s> don quixote , when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his lady dulcinea , could not endure it , and lifting his pike , without saying anything to sancho or uttering a word , he gave him two such thwacks that he brought him to the ground; and had it not been that dorothea cried out to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on the spot . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> know you not , lout , vagabond , beggar , that were it not for the might that she infuses into my arm i should not have strength enough to kill a flea? </s> </s>

<s> <s> o whoreson scoundrel , how ungrateful you are , you see yourself raised from the dust of the earth to be a titled lord , and the return you make for so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who has conferred it upon you! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said , and rising with some degree of nimbleness he ran to place himself behind dorothea s palfrey , and from that position he said to his master: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that is what i complain of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> let your worship at any rate marry this queen , now that we have got her here as if showered down from heaven , and afterwards you may go back to my lady dulcinea; for there must have been kings in the world who kept mistresses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> never seen her , blasphemous traitor! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> exclaimed don quixote;  - hast thou not just now brought me a message from her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i mean , said sancho ,  - that i did not see her so much at my leisure that i could take particular notice of her beauty , or of her charms piecemeal; but taken in the lump i like her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that i see , replied sancho ,  - and with me the wish to speak is always the first impulse , and i cannot help saying , once at any rate , what i have on the tip of my tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for all that , sancho , said don quixote ,  - take heed of what thou sayest , for the pitcher goes so often to the welli need say no more to thee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well , said sancho ,  - god is in heaven , and sees all tricks , and will judge who does most harm , i in not speaking right , or your worship in not doing it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho advanced hanging his head and begged his master s hand , which don quixote with dignity presented to him , giving him his blessing as soon as he had kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a little , as he had questions to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss with him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho obeyed , and when the two had gone some distance in advance don quixote said to him ,  - since thy return i have had no opportunity or time to ask thee many particulars touching thy mission and the answer thou hast brought back , and now that chance has granted us the time and opportunity , deny me not the happiness thou canst give me by such good news . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let your worship ask what you will , answered sancho ,  - for i shall find a way out of all as i found a way in; but i implore you , seor , not to be so revengeful in future . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s> while this was going on they saw coming along the road they were following a man mounted on an ass , who when he came close seemed to be a gipsy; but sancho panza , whose eyes and heart were there wherever he saw asses , no sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be gines de pasamonte; and by the thread of the gipsy he got at the ball , his ass , for it was , in fact , dapple that carried pasamonte , who to escape recognition and to sell the ass had disguised himself as a gipsy , being able to speak the gipsy language , and many more , as well as if they were his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho hastened to his dapple , and embracing him he said ,  - how hast thou fared , my blessing , dapple of my eyes , my comrade? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the ass held his peace , and let himself be kissed and caressed by sancho without answering a single word . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while the two had been going along conversing in this fashion , the curate observed to dorothea that she had shown great cleverness , as well in the story itself as in its conciseness , and the resemblance it bore to those of the books of chivalry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so i saw , said the curate ,  - and for that reason i made haste to say what i did , by which it was all set right . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but is it not a strange thing to see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these figments and lies , simply because they are in the style and manner of the absurdities of his books? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but another strange thing about it , said the curate ,  - is that , apart from the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connection with his craze , when other subjects are dealt with , he can discuss them in a perfectly rational manner , showing that his mind is quite clear and composed; so that , provided his chivalry is not touched upon , no one would take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound understanding . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - friend panza , let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels , and tell me now , dismissing anger and irritation , where , how , and when didst thou find dulcinea? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what was she doing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what didst thou say to her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what did she answer? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how did she look when she was reading my letter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is as thou sayest , said don quixote ,  - for the note - book in which i wrote it i found in my own possession two days after thy departure , which gave me very great vexation , as i knew not what thou wouldst do on finding thyself without any letter; and i made sure thou wouldst return from the place where thou didst first miss it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so i should have done , said sancho ,  - if i had not got it by heart when your worship read it to me , so that i repeated it to a sacristan , who copied it out for me from hearing it , so exactly that he said in all the days of his life , though he had read many a letter of excommunication , he had never seen or read so pretty a letter as that . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and hast thou got it still in thy memory , sancho? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , seor , replied sancho ,  - for as soon as i had repeated it , seeing there was no further use for it , i set about forgetting it; and if i recollect any of it , it is that about scrubbing ,  i mean to say sovereign lady ,  and the end yours till death , the knight of the rueful countenance;  and between these two i put into it more than three hundred my souls  and my life s  and my eyes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - go on; thou didst reach her; and what was that queen of beauty doing? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> surely thou didst find her stringing pearls , or embroidering some device in gold thread for this her enslaved knight . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then depend upon it , said don quixote ,  - the grains of that wheat were pearls when touched by her hands; and didst thou look , friend? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> was it white wheat or brown? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was neither , but red , said sancho . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then i promise thee , said don quixote ,  - that , winnowed by her hands , beyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; but go on; when thou gavest her my letter , did she kiss it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> did she perform any ceremony befitting it , or what did she do? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when i went to give it to her , replied sancho ,  - she was hard at it swaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve , and she said to me , lay the letter , friend , on the top of that sack , for i cannot read it until i have done sifting all this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote;  - that was in order to read it at her leisure and enjoy it; proceed , sancho; while she was engaged in her occupation what converse did she hold with thee? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what did she ask about me , and what answer didst thou give? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> make haste; tell me all , and let not an atom be left behind in the ink - bottle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - she asked me nothing , said sancho;  - but i told her how your worship was left doing penance in her service , naked from the waist up , in among these mountains like a savage , sleeping on the ground , not eating bread off a tablecloth nor combing your beard , weeping and cursing your fortune . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - in saying i cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong , said don quixote;  - for rather do i bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life for having made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as dulcinea del toboso . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i measured in this way , said sancho;  - going to help her to put a sack of wheat on the back of an ass , we came so close together that i could see she stood more than a good palm over me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote ,  - and doth she not of a truth accompany and adorn this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all i can say is , said sancho ,  - that i did perceive a little odour , something goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat with hard work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it could not be that , said don quixote ,  - but thou must have been suffering from cold in the head , or must have smelt thyself; for i know well what would be the scent of that rose among thorns , that lily of the field , that dissolved amber . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - maybe so , replied sancho;  - there often comes from myself that same odour which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady dulcinea; but that s no wonder , for one devil is like another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well then , continued don quixote ,  - now she has done sifting the corn and sent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the letter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as for the letter , said sancho ,  - she did not read it , for she said she could neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up into small pieces , saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest her secrets should become known in the village , and that what i had told her by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her , and the extraordinary penance you were doing for her sake , was enough; and , to make an end of it , she told me to tell your worship that she kissed your hands , and that she had a greater desire to see you than to write to you; and that therefore she entreated and commanded you , on sight of this present , to come out of these thickets , and to have done with carrying on absurdities , and to set out at once for el toboso , unless something else of greater importance should happen , for she had a great desire to see your worship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant to give the squires , damsels , or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to the knights , or of their knights to the ladies , some rich jewel as a guerdon for good news ,  and acknowledgment of the message . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but knowest thou what amazes me , sancho? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it seems to me thou must have gone and come through the air , for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to el toboso and return , though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from which i am inclined to think that the sage magician who is my friend , and watches over my interests ( for of necessity there is and must be one , or else i should not be a right knight - errant ) , that this same , i say , must have helped thee to travel without thy knowledge; for some of these sages will catch up a knight - errant sleeping in his bed , and without his knowing how or in what way it happened , he wakes up the next day more than a thousand leagues away from the place where he went to sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for a knight , maybe , is fighting in the mountains of armenia with some dragon , or fierce serpent , or another knight , and gets the worst of the battle , and is at the point of death; but when he least looks for it , there appears over against him on a cloud , or chariot of fire , another knight , a friend of his , who just before had been in england , and who takes his part , and delivers him from death; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters supping very much to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other will have been two or three thousand leagues . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and all this is done by the craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant knights; so that , friend sancho , i find no difficulty in believing that thou mayest have gone from this place to el toboso and returned in such a short time , since , as i have said , some friendly sage must have carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that must have been it , said sancho ,  - for indeed rocinante went like a gipsy s ass with quicksilver in his ears . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - quicksilver! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote ,  - aye and what is more , a legion of devils , folk that can travel and make others travel without being weary , exactly as the whim seizes them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but putting this aside , what thinkest thou i ought to do about my lady s command to go and see her? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for though i feel that i am bound to obey her mandate , i feel too that i am debarred by the boon i have accorded to the princess that accompanies us , and the law of chivalry compels me to have regard for my word in preference to my inclination; on the one hand the desire to see my lady pursues and harasses me , on the other my solemn promise and the glory i shall win in this enterprise urge and call me; but what i think i shall do is to travel with all speed and reach quickly the place where this giant is , and on my arrival i shall cut off his head , and establish the princess peacefully in her realm , and forthwith i shall return to behold the light that lightens my senses , to whom i shall make such excuses that she will be led to approve of my delay , for she will see that it entirely tends to increase her glory and fame; for all that i have won , am winning , or shall win by arms in this life , comes to me of the favour she extends to me , and because i am hers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me , seor , do you mean to travel all that way for nothing , and to let slip and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a portion a kingdom that in sober truth i have heard say is more than twenty thousand leagues round about , and abounds with all things necessary to support human life , and is bigger than portugal and castile put together? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> peace , for the love of god! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> blush for what you have said , and take my advice , and forgive me , and marry at once in the first village where there is a curate; if not , here is our licentiate who will do the business beautifully; remember , i am old enough to give advice , and this i am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in the hand is better than a vulture on the wing , and he who has the good to his hand and chooses the bad , that the good he complains of may not come to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - look here , sancho , said don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if thou art advising me to marry , in order that immediately on slaying the giant i may become king , and be able to confer favours on thee , and give thee what i have promised , let me tell thee i shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires without marrying; for before going into battle i will make it a stipulation that , if i come out of it victorious , even i do not marry , they shall give me a portion of the kingdom , that i may bestow it upon whomsoever i choose , and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou have me bestow it but upon thee? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is plain speaking , said sancho;  - but let your worship take care to choose it on the seacoast , so that if i don t like the life , i may be able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as i have said; don t mind going to see my lady dulcinea now , but go and kill this giant and let us finish off this business; for by god it strikes me it will be one of great honour and great profit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well then , if that be so , said sancho ,  - how is it that your worship makes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves before my lady dulcinea , this being the same thing as signing your name to it that you love her and are her lover? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as those who go must perforce kneel before her and say they come from your worship to submit themselves to her , how can the thoughts of both of you be hid? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for thou must know that according to our way of thinking in chivalry , it is a high honour to a lady to have many knights - errant in her service , whose thoughts never go beyond serving her for her own sake , and who look for no other reward for their great and true devotion than that she should be willing to accept them as her knights . </s> </s>

<s> <s> don quixote drew up , not a little to the satisfaction of sancho , for he was by this time weary of telling so many lies , and in dread of his master catching him tripping , for though he knew that dulcinea was a peasant girl of el toboso , he had never seen her in all his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cardenio had now put on the clothes which dorothea was wearing when they found her , and though they were not very good , they were far better than those he put off . </s> </s>

<s> <s> don quixote recognised him , and taking his hand he turned to those present and said:  - that your worships may see how important it is to have knights - errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by tyrannical and wicked men in this world , i may tell you that some days ago passing through a wood , i heard cries and piteous complaints as of a person in pain and distress; i immediately hastened , impelled by my bounden duty , to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me to proceed , and i found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before you , which in my heart i rejoice at , for his testimony will not permit me to depart from the truth in any particular . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  the master made i know not what speeches and explanations , which , though i listened to them , i did not accept . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , i compelled the clown to unbind him , and to swear he would take him with him , and pay him real by real , and perfumed into the bargain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> is not all this true , andres my son? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> answer without hesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place , that they may see that it is as great an advantage as i say to have knights - errant abroad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all that your worship has said is quite true , answered the lad;  - but the end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your worship supposes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - how! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the opposite? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - not only did he not pay me , replied the lad ,  - but as soon as your worship had passed out of the wood and we were alone , he tied me up again to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging , that left me like a flayed saint bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up with some jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship , and but for the pain i was suffering i should have laughed at the things he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short he left me in such a condition that i have been until now in a hospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascally clown inflicted on me then; for all which your worship is to blame; for if you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for you , nor meddled in other people s affairs , my master would have been content with giving me one or two dozen lashes , and would have then loosed me and paid me what he owed me; but when your worship abused him so out of measure , and gave him so many hard words , his anger was kindled; and as he could not revenge himself on you , as soon as he saw you had left him the storm burst upon me in such a way , that i feel as if i should never be a man again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not , said don quixote; and so saying , he got up hastily and bade sancho bridle rocinante , who was browsing while they were eating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea asked him what he meant to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which she replied that he must remember that in accordance with his promise he could not engage in any enterprise until he had concluded hers; and that as he knew this better than anyone , he should restrain his ardour until his return from her kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is true , said don quixote ,  - and andres must have patience until my return as you say , seora; but i once more swear and promise not to stop until i have seen him avenged and paid . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - this share of bread and cheese i am giving you , answered sancho;  - and god knows whether i shall feel the want of it myself or not; for i would have you know , friend , that we squires to knights - errant have to bear a great deal of hunger and hard fortune , and even other things more easily felt than told . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> andres seized his bread and cheese , and seeing that nobody gave him anything more , bent his head , and took hold of the road , as the saying is . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote was getting up to chastise him , but he took to his heels at such a pace that no one attempted to follow him; and mightily chapfallen was don quixote at andres  story , and the others had to take great care to restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out of countenance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their dainty repast being finished , they saddled at once , and without any adventure worth mentioning they reached next day the inn , the object of sancho panza s fear and dread; but though he would have rather not entered it , there was no help for it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlady , the landlord , their daughter , and maritornes , when they saw don quixote and sancho coming , went out to welcome them with signs of hearty satisfaction , which don quixote received with dignity and gravity , and bade them make up a better bed for him than the last time: to which the landlady replied that if he paid better than he did the last time she would give him one fit for a prince . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote said he would , so they made up a tolerable one for him in the same garret as before; and he lay down at once , being sorely shaken and in want of sleep . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the licentiate told him to let her have it , as there was now no further occasion for that stratagem , because he might declare himself and appear in his own character , and tell don quixote that he had fled to this inn when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him; and should he ask for the princess s squire , they could tell him that she had sent him on before her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that she was coming , and bringing with her the deliverer of them all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this the barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady , and at the same time they returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect don quixote s deliverance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the people of the inn were struck with astonishment at the beauty of dorothea , and even at the comely figure of the shepherd cardenio . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curate made them get ready such fare as there was in the inn , and the landlord , in hope of better payment , served them up a tolerably good dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this time don quixote was asleep , and they thought it best not to waken him , as sleeping would now do him more good than eating . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while at dinner , the company consisting of the landlord , his wife , their daughter , maritornes , and all the travellers , they discussed the strange craze of don quixote and the manner in which he had been found; and the landlady told them what had taken place between him and the carrier; and then , looking round to see if sancho was there , when she saw he was not , she gave them the whole story of his blanketing , which they received with no little amusement . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but on the curate observing that it was the books of chivalry which don quixote had read that had turned his brain , the landlord said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i cannot understand how that can be , for in truth to my mind there is no better reading in the world , and i have here two or three of them , with other writings that are the very life , not only of myself but of plenty more; for when it is harvest - time , the reapers flock here on holidays , and there is always one among them who can read and who takes up one of these books , and we gather round him , thirty or more of us , and stay listening to him with a delight that makes our grey hairs grow young again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is true , said maritornes;  - and , faith , i relish hearing these things greatly too , for they are very pretty; especially when they describe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the orange trees , and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead with envy and fright; all this i say is as good as honey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the curate turning to the landlord s daughter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t know indeed , seor , said she;  - i listen too , and to tell the truth , though i do not understand it , i like hearing it; but it is not the blows that my father likes that i like , but the laments the knights utter when they are separated from their ladies; and indeed they sometimes make me weep with the pity i feel for them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then you would console them if it was for you they wept , young lady? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said dorothea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t know what i should do , said the girl;  - i only know that there are some of those ladies so cruel that they call their knights tigers and lions and a thousand other foul names: and jesus! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i don t know what sort of folk they can be , so unfeeling and heartless , that rather than bestow a glance upon a worthy man they leave him to die or go mad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i don t know what is the good of such prudery; if it is for honour s sake , why not marry them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that s all they want . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - hush , child , said the landlady;  - it seems to me thou knowest a great deal about these things , and it is not fit for girls to know or talk so much . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as the gentleman asked me , i could not help answering him , said the girl . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well then , said the curate ,  - bring me these books , seor landlord , for i should like to see them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with all my heart , said he , and going into his own room he brought out an old valise secured with a little chain , on opening which the curate found in it three large books and some manuscripts written in a very good hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first that he opened he found to be  - don cirongilio of thrace , and the second  - don felixmarte of hircania , and the other the  - history of the great captain gonzalo hernandez de cordova , with the life of diego garcia de paredes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when the curate read the two first titles he looked over at the barber and said ,  - we want my friend s housekeeper and niece here now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nay , said the barber ,  - i can do just as well to carry them to the yard or to the hearth , and there is a very good fire there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - only these two , said the curate ,  - don cirongilio , and felixmarte . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - are my books , then , heretics or phlegmatics that you want to burn them? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said the landlord . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - schismatics you mean , friend , said the barber ,  - not phlegmatics . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> stopping a mill - wheel! </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and then , what do you say to the good cirongilio of thrace , that was so stout and bold; as may be seen in the book , where it is related that as he was sailing along a river there came up out of the midst of the water against him a fiery serpent , and he , as soon as he saw it , flung himself upon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders , and squeezed its throat with both hands with such force that the serpent , finding he was throttling it , had nothing for it but to let itself sink to the bottom of the river , carrying with it the knight who would not let go his hold; and when they got down there he found himself among palaces and gardens so pretty that it was a wonder to see; and then the serpent changed itself into an old ancient man , who told him such things as were never heard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a couple of figs for your great captain and your diego garcia! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> hearing this dorothea said in a whisper to cardenio ,  - our landlord is almost fit to play a second part to don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i think so , said cardenio ,  - for , as he shows , he accepts it as a certainty that everything those books relate took place exactly as it is written down; and the barefooted friars themselves would not persuade him to the contrary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is a good joke for your worship to try and persuade me that everything these good books say is nonsense and lies , and they printed by the license of the lords of the royal council , as if they were people who would allow such a lot of lies to be printed all together , and so many battles and enchantments that they take away one s senses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i have told you , friend , said the curate ,  - that this is done to divert our idle thoughts; and as in well - ordered states games of chess , fives , and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not care , or are not obliged , or are unable to work , so books of this kind are allowed to be printed , on the supposition that , what indeed is the truth , there can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true stories; and if it were permitted me now , and the present company desired it , i could say something about the qualities books of chivalry should possess to be good ones , that would be to the advantage and even to the taste of some; but i hope the time will come when i can communicate my ideas to some one who may be able to mend matters; and in the meantime , seor landlord , believe what i have said , and take your books , and make up your mind about their truth or falsehood , and much good may they do you; and god grant you may not fall lame of the same foot your guest don quixote halts on . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no fear of that , returned the landlord;  - i shall not be so mad as to make a knight - errant of myself; for i see well enough that things are not now as they used to be in those days , when they say those famous knights roamed about the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlord was carrying away the valise and the books , but the curate said to him ,  - wait; i want to see what those papers are that are written in such a good hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curate read three or four lines to himself , and said ,  - i must say the title of this novel does not seem to me a bad one , and i feel an inclination to read it all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which the landlord replied ,  - then your reverence will do well to read it , for i can tell you that some guests who have read it here have been much pleased with it , and have begged it of me very earnestly; but i would not give it , meaning to return it to the person who forgot the valise , books , and papers here , for maybe he will return here some time or other; and though i know i shall miss the books , faith i mean to return them; for though i am an innkeeper , still i am a christian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you are very right , friend , said the curate;  - but for all that , if the novel pleases me you must let me copy it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - with all my heart , replied the host . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it will be rest enough for me , said dorothea ,  - to while away the time by listening to some tale , for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to let me sleep when it would be seasonable . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well then , in that case , said the curate ,  - i will read it , if it were only out of curiosity; perhaps it may contain something pleasant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> master nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect , and sancho too; seeing which , and considering that he would give pleasure to all , and receive it himself , the curate said ,  - well then , attend to me everyone , for the novel begins thus . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in florence , a rich and famous city of italy in the province called tuscany , there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality , anselmo and lothario , such great friends that by way of distinction they were called by all that knew them  - the two friends . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were unmarried , young , of the same age and of the same tastes , which was enough to account for the reciprocal friendship between them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anselmo , it is true , was somewhat more inclined to seek pleasure in love than lothario , for whom the pleasures of the chase had more attraction; but on occasion anselmo would forego his own tastes to yield to those of lothario , and lothario would surrender his to fall in with those of anselmo , and in this way their inclinations kept pace one with the other with a concord so perfect that the best regulated clock could not surpass it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anselmo was deep in love with a high - born and beautiful maiden of the same city , the daughter of parents so estimable , and so estimable herself , that he resolved , with the approval of his friend lothario , without whom he did nothing , to ask her of them in marriage , and did so , lothario being the bearer of the demand , and conducting the negotiation so much to the satisfaction of his friend that in a short time he was in possession of the object of his desires , and camilla so happy in having won anselmo for her husband , that she gave thanks unceasingly to heaven and to lothario , by whose means such good fortune had fallen to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to all this and much more that anselmo said to lothario to persuade him to come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing , lothario replied with so much prudence , sense , and judgment , that anselmo was satisfied of his friend s good intentions , and it was agreed that on two days in the week , and on holidays , lothario should come to dine with him; but though this arrangement was made between them lothario resolved to observe it no further than he considered to be in accordance with the honour of his friend , whose good name was more to him than his own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said , and justly , that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as carefully what friends he brought to his house as what female friends his wife associated with , for what cannot be done or arranged in the market - place , in church , at public festivals or at stations ( opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives ) , may be easily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whom most confidence is reposed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lothario said , too , that every married man should have some friend who would point out to him any negligence he might be guilty of in his conduct , for it will sometimes happen that owing to the deep affection the husband bears his wife either he does not caution her , or , not to vex her , refrains from telling her to do or not to do certain things , doing or avoiding which may be a matter of honour or reproach to him; and errors of this kind he could easily correct if warned by a friend . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of a truth i know not; lothario alone was such a one , for with the utmost care and vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend , and strove to diminish , cut down , and reduce the number of days for going to his house according to their agreement , lest the visits of a young man , wealthy , high - born , and with the attractions he was conscious of possessing , at the house of a woman so beautiful as camilla , should be regarded with suspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of the idle public . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for though his integrity and reputation might bridle slanderous tongues , still he was unwilling to hazard either his own good name or that of his friend; and for this reason most of the days agreed upon he devoted to some other business which he pretended was unavoidable; so that a great portion of the day was taken up with complaints on one side and excuses on the other . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thou mayest suppose , lothario my friend , that i am unable to give sufficient thanks for the favours god has rendered me in making me the son of such parents as mine were , and bestowing upon me with no niggard hand what are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune , and above all for what he has done in giving me thee for a friend and camilla for a wifetwo treasures that i value , if not as highly as i ought , at least as highly as i am able . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and yet , with all these good things , which are commonly all that men need to enable them to live happily , i am the most discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole world; for , i know not how long since , i have been harassed and oppressed by a desire so strange and so unusual , that i wonder at myself and blame and chide myself when i am alone , and strive to stifle it and hide it from my own thoughts , and with no better success than if i were endeavouring deliberately to publish it to all the world; and as , in short , it must come out , i would confide it to thy safe keeping , feeling sure that by this means , and by thy readiness as a true friend to afford me relief , i shall soon find myself freed from the distress it causes me , and that thy care will give me happiness in the same degree as my own folly has caused me misery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the words of anselmo struck lothario with astonishment , unable as he was to conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though he strove to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend , his conjectures were all far from the truth , and to relieve the anxiety which this perplexity was causing him , he told him he was doing a flagrant injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous methods of confiding to him his most hidden thoughts , for he well knew he might reckon upon his counsel in diverting them , or his help in carrying them into effect . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that is the truth , replied anselmo ,  - and relying upon that i will tell thee , friend lothario , that the desire which harasses me is that of knowing whether my wife camilla is as good and as perfect as i think her to be; and i cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point except by testing her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity of her virtue as the fire proves that of gold; because i am persuaded , my friend , that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is not tempted; and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the promises , gifts , tears , and importunities of earnest lovers; for what thanks does a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be bad , and what wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to whom no opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows she has a husband that will take her life the first time he detects her in an impropriety? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and if the result be the contrary of what i expect , in the satisfaction of knowing that i have been right in my opinion , i shall bear without complaint the pain which my so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and , as nothing of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me from carrying it into effect , it is my desire , friend lothario , that thou shouldst consent to become the instrument for effecting this purpose that i am bent upon , for i will afford thee opportunities to that end , and nothing shall be wanting that i may think necessary for the pursuit of a virtuous , honourable , modest and high - minded woman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and among other reasons , i am induced to entrust this arduous task to thee by the consideration that if camilla be conquered by thee the conquest will not be pushed to extremes , but only far enough to account that accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone; thus i shall not be wronged in anything more than intention , and my wrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence , which i know well will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if , therefore , thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life , thou wilt at once engage in this love struggle , not lukewarmly nor slothfully , but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands , and with the loyalty our friendship assures me of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such were the words anselmo addressed to lothario , who listened to them with such attention that , except to say what has been already mentioned , he did not open his lips until the other had finished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then perceiving that he had no more to say , after regarding him for awhile , as one would regard something never before seen that excited wonder and amazement , he said to him ,  - i cannot persuade myself , anselmo my friend , that what thou hast said to me is not in jest; if i thought that thou wert speaking seriously i would not have allowed thee to go so far; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening to thee i verily suspect that either thou dost not know me , or i do not know thee; but no , i know well thou art anselmo , and thou knowest that i am lothario; the misfortune is , it seems to me , that thou art not the anselmo thou wert , and must have thought that i am not the lothario i should be; for the things that thou hast said to me are not those of that anselmo who was my friend , nor are those that thou demandest of me what should be asked of the lothario thou knowest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> true friends will prove their friends and make use of them , as a poet has said , usque ad aras; whereby he meant that they will not make use of their friendship in things that are contrary to god s will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if this , then , was a heathen s feeling about friendship , how much more should it be a christian s , who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for the sake of any human friendship? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and if a friend should go so far as to put aside his duty to heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend , it should not be in matters that are trifling or of little moment , but in such as affect the friend s life and honour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> listen to me , anselmo my friend , and be not impatient to answer me until i have said what occurs to me touching the object of thy desire , for there will be time enough left for thee to reply and for me to hear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - be it so , said anselmo ,  - say what thou wilt . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lothario then went on to say ,  - it seems to me , anselmo , that thine is just now the temper of mind which is always that of the moors , who can never be brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the holy scriptures , or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the understanding or are founded upon the articles of faith , but must have examples that are palpable , easy , intelligible , capable of proof , not admitting of doubt , with mathematical demonstrations that cannot be denied , like , if equals be taken from equals , the remainders are equal:  and if they do not understand this in words , and indeed they do not , it has to be shown to them with the hands , and put before their eyes , and even with all this no one succeeds in convincing them of the truth of our holy religion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and that thou mayest clearly see this , say , anselmo , hast thou not told me that i must force my suit upon a modest woman , decoy one that is virtuous , make overtures to one that is pure - minded , pay court to one that is prudent? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> yes , thou hast told me so . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then , if thou knowest that thou hast a wife , modest , virtuous , pure - minded and prudent , what is it that thou seekest? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and if thou believest that she will come forth victorious from all my attacksas doubtless she wouldwhat higher titles than those she possesses now dost thou think thou canst bestow upon her then , or in what will she be better then than she is now? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but if she be as virtuous as thou believest , it is an uncalled - for proceeding to make trial of truth itself , for , after trial , it will but be in the same estimation as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus , then , it is conclusive that to attempt things from which harm rather than advantage may come to us is the part of unreasoning and reckless minds , more especially when they are things which we are not forced or compelled to attempt , and which show from afar that it is plainly madness to attempt them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - difficulties are attempted either for the sake of god or for the sake of the world , or for both; those undertaken for god s sake are those which the saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of angels in human bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world are those of the men who traverse such a vast expanse of water , such a variety of climates , so many strange countries , to acquire what are called the blessings of fortune; and those undertaken for the sake of god and the world together are those of brave soldiers , who no sooner do they see in the enemy s wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball could make , than , casting aside all fear , without hesitating , or heeding the manifest peril that threatens them , borne onward by the desire of defending their faith , their country , and their king , they fling themselves dauntlessly into the midst of the thousand opposing deaths that await them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> such are the things that men are wont to attempt , and there is honour , glory , gain , in attempting them , however full of difficulty and peril they may be; but that which thou sayest it is thy wish to attempt and carry out will not win thee the glory of god nor the blessings of fortune nor fame among men; for even if the issue be as thou wouldst have it , thou wilt be no happier , richer , or more honoured than thou art this moment; and if it be otherwise thou wilt be reduced to misery greater than can be imagined , for then it will avail thee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the misfortune that has befallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee that thou knowest it thyself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and in confirmation of the truth of what i say , let me repeat to thee a stanza made by the famous poet luigi tansillo at the end of the first part of his tears of saint peter ,  which says thus: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the anguish and the shame but greater grew in peter s heart as morning slowly came; no eye was there to see him , well he knew , yet he himself was to himself a shame; exposed to all men s gaze , or screened from view , a noble heart will feel the pang the same; a prey to shame the sinning soul will be , though none but heaven and earth its shame can see . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow , but rather thou wilt shed tears unceasingly , if not tears of the eyes , tears of blood from the heart , like those shed by that simple doctor our poet tells us of , that tried the test of the cup , which the wise rinaldo , better advised , refused to do; for though this may be a poetic fiction it contains a moral lesson worthy of attention and study and imitation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover by what i am about to say to thee thou wilt be led to see the great error thou wouldst commit . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me , anselmo , if heaven or good fortune had made thee master and lawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality , with the excellence and purity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had been satisfied , saying with one voice and common consent that in purity , quality , and fineness , it was all that a stone of the kind could possibly be , thou thyself too being of the same belief , as knowing nothing to the contrary , would it be reasonable in thee to desire to take that diamond and place it between an anvil and a hammer , and by mere force of blows and strength of arm try if it were as hard and as fine as they said? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and if thou didst , and if the stone should resist so silly a test , that would add nothing to its value or reputation; and if it were broken , as it might be , would not all be lost? </s> </s>

<s> <s> consider , then , anselmo my friend , that camilla is a diamond of the finest quality as well in thy estimation as in that of others , and that it is contrary to reason to expose her to the risk of being broken; for if she remains intact she cannot rise to a higher value than she now possesses; and if she give way and be unable to resist , bethink thee now how thou wilt be deprived of her , and with what good reason thou wilt complain of thyself for having been the cause of her ruin and thine own . </s> </s>

<s> <s> that thou wouldst rob me of it is clear , for when camilla sees that i pay court to her as thou requirest , she will certainly regard me as a man without honour or right feeling , since i attempt and do a thing so much opposed to what i owe to my own position and thy friendship . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> that thou wouldst have me rob thee of it is beyond a doubt , for camilla , seeing that i press my suit upon her , will suppose that i have perceived in her something light that has encouraged me to make known to her my base desire; and if she holds herself dishonoured , her dishonour touches thee as belonging to her; and hence arises what so commonly takes place , that the husband of the adulterous woman , though he may not be aware of or have given any cause for his wife s failure in her duty , or ( being careless or negligent ) have had it in his power to prevent his dishonour , nevertheless is stigmatised by a vile and reproachful name , and in a manner regarded with eyes of contempt instead of pity by all who know of his wife s guilt , though they see that he is unfortunate not by his own fault , but by the lust of a vicious consort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when god created our first parent in the earthly paradise , the holy scripture says that he infused sleep into adam and while he slept took a rib from his left side of which he formed our mother eve , and when adam awoke and beheld her he said , this is flesh of my flesh , and bone of my bone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and god said for this shall a man leave his father and his mother , and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was instituted the divine sacrament of marriage , with such ties that death alone can loose them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and such is the force and virtue of this miraculous sacrament that it makes two different persons one and the same flesh; and even more than this when the virtuous are married; for though they have two souls they have but one will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and hence it follows that as the flesh of the wife is one and the same with that of her husband the stains that may come upon it , or the injuries it incurs fall upon the husband s flesh , though he , as has been said , may have given no cause for them; for as the pain of the foot or any member of the body is felt by the whole body , because all is one flesh , as the head feels the hurt to the ankle without having caused it , so the husband , being one with her , shares the dishonour of the wife; and as all worldly honour or dishonour comes of flesh and blood , and the erring wife s is of that kind , the husband must needs bear his part of it and be held dishonoured without knowing it . </s> </s>

<s> <s> and this thou art bound to do for one reason alone , that , being , as i am , resolved to apply this test , it is not for thee to permit me to reveal my weakness to another , and so imperil that honour thou art striving to keep me from losing; and if thine may not stand as high as it ought in the estimation of camilla while thou art paying court to her , that is of little or no importance , because ere long , on finding in her that constancy which we expect , thou canst tell her the plain truth as regards our stratagem , and so regain thy place in her esteem; and as thou art venturing so little , and by the venture canst afford me so much satisfaction , refuse not to undertake it , even if further difficulties present themselves to thee; for , as i have said , if thou wilt only make a beginning i will acknowledge the issue decided . </s> </s>

<s> <s> anselmo received this letter , and from it he gathered that lothario had already begun his task and that camilla must have replied to him as he would have wished; and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence he sent word to her not to leave his house on any account , as he would very shortly return . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> camilla was astonished at anselmo s reply , which placed her in greater perplexity than before , for she neither dared to remain in her own house , nor yet to go to her parents ; for in remaining her virtue was imperilled , and in going she was opposing her husband s commands . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> finally she decided upon what was the worse course for her , to remain , resolving not to fly from the presence of lothario , that she might not give food for gossip to her servants; and she now began to regret having written as she had to her husband , fearing he might imagine that lothario had perceived in her some lightness which had impelled him to lay aside the respect he owed her; but confident of her rectitude she put her trust in god and in her own virtuous intentions , with which she hoped to resist in silence all the solicitations of lothario , without saying anything to her husband so as not to involve him in any quarrel or trouble; and she even began to consider how to excuse lothario to anselmo when he should ask her what it was that induced her to write that letter . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short he felt that while anselmo s absence afforded time and opportunity he must press the siege of the fortress , and so he assailed her self - esteem with praises of her beauty , for there is nothing that more quickly reduces and levels the castle towers of fair women s vanity than vanity itself upon the tongue of flattery . </s> </s>

<s> <s> leonela alone knew of her mistress s weakness , for the two false friends and new lovers were unable to conceal it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> lothario did not care to tell camilla the object anselmo had in view , nor that he had afforded him the opportunity of attaining such a result , lest she should undervalue his love and think that it was by chance and without intending it and not of his own accord that he had made love to her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the tidings i have to give thee , anselmo my friend , said lothario ,  - are that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern and crown of all good wives . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , as camilla is the essence of all beauty , so is she the treasure - house where purity dwells , and gentleness and modesty abide with all the virtues that can confer praise , honour , and happiness upon a woman . </s> </s>

<s> <s> anselmo was completely satisfied by the words of lothario , and believed them as fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle; nevertheless he begged of him not to relinquish the undertaking , were it but for the sake of curiosity and amusement; though thenceforward he need not make use of the same earnest endeavours as before; all he wished him to do was to write some verses to her , praising her under the name of chloris , for he himself would give her to understand that he was in love with a lady to whom he had given that name to enable him to sing her praises with the decorum due to her modesty; and if lothario were unwilling to take the trouble of writing the verses he would compose them himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that will not be necessary , said lothario ,  - for the muses are not such enemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the course of the year . </s> </s>

<s> <s> camilla replied that it had seemed to her that lothario looked at her somewhat more freely than when he had been at home; but that now she was undeceived and believed it to have been only her own imagination , for lothario now avoided seeing her , or being alone with her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anselmo told her she might be quite easy on the score of that suspicion , for he knew that lothario was in love with a damsel of rank in the city whom he celebrated under the name of chloris , and that even if he were not , his fidelity and their great friendship left no room for fear . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> had not camilla , however , been informed beforehand by lothario that this love for chloris was a pretence , and that he himself had told anselmo of it in order to be able sometimes to give utterance to the praises of camilla herself , no doubt she would have fallen into the despairing toils of jealousy; but being forewarned she received the startling news without uneasiness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the next day as the three were at table anselmo asked lothario to recite something of what he had composed for his mistress chloris; for as camilla did not know her , he might safely say what he liked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - even did she know her , returned lothario ,  - i would hide nothing , for when a lover praises his lady s beauty , and charges her with cruelty , he casts no imputation upon her fair name; at any rate , all i can say is that yesterday i made a sonnet on the ingratitude of this chloris , which goes thus: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the sonnet pleased camilla , and still more anselmo , for he praised it and said the lady was excessively cruel who made no return for sincerity so manifest . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - as poets they do not tell the truth , replied lothario;  - but as lovers they are not more defective in expression than they are truthful . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is no doubt of that , observed anselmo , anxious to support and uphold lothario s ideas with camilla , who was as regardless of his design as she was deep in love with lothario; and so taking delight in anything that was his , and knowing that his thoughts and writings had her for their object , and that she herself was the real chloris , she asked him to repeat some other sonnet or verses if he recollected any . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i do , replied lothario ,  - but i do not think it as good as the first one , or , more correctly speaking , less bad; but you can easily judge , for it is this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anselmo praised this second sonnet too , as he had praised the first; and so he went on adding link after link to the chain with which he was binding himself and making his dishonour secure; for when lothario was doing most to dishonour him he told him he was most honoured; and thus each step that camilla descended towards the depths of her abasement , she mounted , in his opinion , towards the summit of virtue and fair fame . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i fear that he will think ill of my pliancy or lightness , not considering the irresistible influence he brought to bear upon me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let not that trouble you , my lady , said leonela ,  - for it does not take away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to give it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized; nay , they are wont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> moreover , lady camilla , you did not surrender yourself or yield so quickly but that first you saw lothario s whole soul in his eyes , in his sighs , in his words , his promises and his gifts , and by it and his good qualities perceived how worthy he was of your love . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is to my eyes and thinking , amiable , brave , courteous , distinguished , elegant , fond , gay , honourable , illustrious , loyal , manly , noble , open , polite , quickwitted , rich , and the s s according to the saying , and then tender , veracious: x does not suit him , for it is a rough letter; y has been given already; and z zealous for your honour . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> camilla laughed at her maid s alphabet , and perceived her to be more experienced in love affairs than she said , which she admitted , confessing to camilla that she had love passages with a young man of good birth of the same city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> camilla was uneasy at this , dreading lest it might prove the means of endangering her honour , and asked whether her intrigue had gone beyond words , and she with little shame and much effrontery said it had; for certain it is that ladies  imprudences make servants shameless , who , when they see their mistresses make a false step , think nothing of going astray themselves , or of its being known . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that camilla could do was to entreat leonela to say nothing about her doings to him whom she called her lover , and to conduct her own affairs secretly lest they should come to the knowledge of anselmo or of lothario . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> leonela said she would , but kept her word in such a way that she confirmed camilla s apprehension of losing her reputation through her means; for this abandoned and bold leonela , as soon as she perceived that her mistress s demeanour was not what it was wont to be , had the audacity to introduce her lover into the house , confident that even if her mistress saw him she would not dare to expose him; for the sins of mistresses entail this mischief among others; they make themselves the slaves of their own servants , and are obliged to hide their laxities and depravities; as was the case with camilla , who though she perceived , not once but many times , that leonela was with her lover in some room of the house , not only did not dare to chide her , but afforded her opportunities for concealing him and removed all difficulties , lest he should be seen by her husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she was unable , however , to prevent him from being seen on one occasion , as he sallied forth at daybreak , by lothario , who , not knowing who he was , at first took him for a spectre; but , as soon as he saw him hasten away , muffling his face with his cloak and concealing himself carefully and cautiously , he rejected this foolish idea , and adopted another , which would have been the ruin of all had not camilla found a remedy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it did not occur to lothario that this man he had seen issuing at such an untimely hour from anselmo s house could have entered it on leonela s account , nor did he even remember there was such a person as leonela; all he thought was that as camilla had been light and yielding with him , so she had been with another; for this further penalty the erring woman s sin brings with it , that her honour is distrusted even by him to whose overtures and persuasions she has yielded; and he believes her to have surrendered more easily to others , and gives implicit credence to every suspicion that comes into his mind . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all lothario s good sense seems to have failed him at this juncture; all his prudent maxims escaped his memory; for without once reflecting rationally , and without more ado , in his impatience and in the blindness of the jealous rage that gnawed his heart , and dying to revenge himself upon camilla , who had done him no wrong , before anselmo had risen he hastened to him and said to him ,  - know , anselmo , that for several days past i have been struggling with myself , striving to withhold from thee what it is no longer possible or right that i should conceal from thee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> know that camilla s fortress has surrendered and is ready to submit to my will; and if i have been slow to reveal this fact to thee , it was in order to see if it were some light caprice of hers , or if she sought to try me and ascertain if the love i began to make to her with thy permission was made with a serious intention . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i thought , too , that she , if she were what she ought to be , and what we both believed her , would have ere this given thee information of my addresses; but seeing that she delays , i believe the truth of the promise she has given me that the next time thou art absent from the house she will grant me an interview in the closet where thy jewels are kept ( and it was true that camilla used to meet him there ); but i do not wish thee to rush precipitately to take vengeance , for the sin is as yet only committed in intention , and camilla s may change perhaps between this and the appointed time , and repentance spring up in its place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and if it be a guilty one , which may be feared rather than expected , with silence , prudence , and discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument of punishment for the wrong done thee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anselmo was amazed , overwhelmed , and astounded at the words of lothario , which came upon him at a time when he least expected to hear them , for he now looked upon camilla as having triumphed over the pretended attacks of lothario , and was beginning to enjoy the glory of her victory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he remained silent for a considerable time , looking on the ground with fixed gaze , and at length said ,  - thou hast behaved , lothario , as i expected of thy friendship: i will follow thy advice in everything; do as thou wilt , and keep this secret as thou seest it should be kept in circumstances so unlooked for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at last he decided upon revealing all to camilla , and , as there was no want of opportunity for doing so , he found her alone the same day; but she , as soon as she had the chance of speaking to him , said ,  - lothario my friend , i must tell thee i have a sorrow in my heart which fills it so that it seems ready to burst; and it will be a wonder if it does not; for the audacity of leonela has now reached such a pitch that every night she conceals a gallant of hers in this house and remains with him till morning , at the expense of my reputation; inasmuch as it is open to anyone to question it who may see him quitting my house at such unseasonable hours; but what distresses me is that i cannot punish or chide her , for her privity to our intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me silent about hers , while i am dreading that some catastrophe will come of it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as camilla said this lothario at first imagined it was some device to delude him into the idea that the man he had seen going out was leonela s lover and not hers; but when he saw how she wept and suffered , and begged him to help her , he became convinced of the truth , and the conviction completed his confusion and remorse; however , he told camilla not to distress herself , as he would take measures to put a stop to the insolence of leonela . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at the same time he told her what , driven by the fierce rage of jealousy , he had said to anselmo , and how he had arranged to hide himself in the closet that he might there see plainly how little she preserved her fidelity to him; and he entreated her pardon for this madness , and her advice as to how to repair it , and escape safely from the intricate labyrinth in which his imprudence had involved him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> camilla was struck with alarm at hearing what lothario said , and with much anger , and great good sense , she reproved him and rebuked his base design and the foolish and mischievous resolution he had made; but as woman has by nature a nimbler wit than man for good and for evil , though it is apt to fail when she sets herself deliberately to reason , camilla on the spur of the moment thought of a way to remedy what was to all appearance irremediable , and told lothario to contrive that the next day anselmo should conceal himself in the place he mentioned , for she hoped from his concealment to obtain the means of their enjoying themselves for the future without any apprehension; and without revealing her purpose to him entirely she charged him to be careful , as soon as anselmo was concealed , to come to her when leonela should call him , and to all she said to him to answer as he would have answered had he not known that anselmo was listening . </s> </s>

<s> <s> lothario then retired , and the next day anselmo , under pretence of going to his friend s country house , took his departure , and then returned to conceal himself , which he was able to do easily , as camilla and leonela took care to give him the opportunity; and so he placed himself in hiding in the state of agitation that it may be imagined he would feel who expected to see the vitals of his honour laid bare before his eyes , and found himself on the point of losing the supreme blessing he thought he possessed in his beloved camilla . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the first to break silence was luscinda , who thus addressed don fernando:  - leave me , seor don fernando , for the sake of what you owe to yourself; if no other reason will induce you , leave me to cling to the wall of which i am the ivy , to the support from which neither your importunities , nor your threats , nor your promises , nor your gifts have been able to detach me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> see how heaven , by ways strange and hidden from our sight , has brought me face to face with my true husband; and well you know by dear - bought experience that death alone will be able to efface him from my memory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - if , my lord , the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine arms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen by this time that she who kneels at thy feet is , so long as thou wilt have it so , the unhappy and unfortunate dorothea . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless , i would not have thee suppose that i have come here driven by my shame; it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself forgotten by thee that have led me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was thy will to make me thine , and thou didst so follow thy will , that now , even though thou repentest , thou canst not help being mine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> bethink thee , my lord , the unsurpassable affection i bear thee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for which thou wouldst desert me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thou didst address thyself to my simplicity , thou didst lay siege to my virtue , thou wert not ignorant of my station , well dost thou know how i yielded wholly to thy will; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception , and if it be so , as it is , and if thou art a christian as thou art a gentleman , why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy at last as thou didst at first? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and if thou wilt not have me for what i am , thy true and lawful wife , at least take and accept me as thy slave , for so long as i am thine i will count myself happy and fortunate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> do not by deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the streets; make not the old age of my parents miserable; for the loyal services they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not deserving of such a return; and if thou thinkest it will debase thy blood to mingle it with mine , reflect that there is little or no nobility in the world that has not travelled the same road , and that in illustrious lineages it is not the woman s blood that is of account; and , moreover , that true nobility consists in virtue , and if thou art wanting in that , refusing me what in justice thou owest me , then even i have higher claims to nobility than thine . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to make an end , seor , these are my last words to thee: whether thou wilt , or wilt not , i am thy wife; witness thy words , which must not and ought not to be false , if thou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornest me; witness the pledge which thou didst give me , and witness heaven , which thou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; and if all this fail , thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its silent voice in the midst of all thy gaiety , and vindicate the truth of what i say and mar thy highest pleasure and enjoyment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this and more the injured dorothea delivered with such earnest feeling and such tears that all present , even those who came with don fernando , were constrained to join her in them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don fernando listened to her without replying , until , ceasing to speak , she gave way to such sobs and sighs that it must have been a heart of brass that was not softened by the sight of so great sorrow . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he , overwhelmed with confusion and astonishment , after regarding dorothea for some moments with a fixed gaze , opened his arms , and , releasing luscinda , exclaimed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thou hast conquered , fair dorothea , thou hast conquered , for it is impossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many truths . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at these words luscinda looked up at cardenio , at first beginning to recognise him by his voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes that it was he , and hardly knowing what she did , and heedless of all considerations of decorum , she flung her arms around his neck and pressing her face close to his , said ,  - yes , my dear lord , you are the true master of this your slave , even though adverse fate interpose again , and fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> a strange sight was this for don fernando and those that stood around , filled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea fancied that don fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to take vengeance on cardenio , for she observed him put his hand to his sword; and the instant the idea struck her , with wonderful quickness she clasped him round the knees , and kissing them and holding him so as to prevent his moving , she said , while her tears continued to flow ,  - what is it thou wouldst do , my only refuge , in this unforeseen event? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for god s sake i entreat of thee , for thine own i implore thee , let not this open manifestation rouse thy anger; but rather so calm it as to allow these two lovers to live in peace and quiet without any interference from thee so long as heaven permits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove the generosity of thy lofty noble spirit , and the world shall see that with thee reason has more influence than passion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the time dorothea was speaking , cardenio , though he held luscinda in his arms , never took his eyes off don fernando , determined , if he saw him make any hostile movement , to try and defend himself and resist as best he could all who might assail him , though it should cost him his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now don fernando s friends , as well as the curate and the barber , who had been present all the while , not forgetting the worthy sancho panza , ran forward and gathered round don fernando , entreating him to have regard for the tears of dorothea , and not suffer her reasonable hopes to be disappointed , since , as they firmly believed , what she said was but the truth; and bidding him observe that it was not , as it might seem , by accident , but by a special disposition of providence that they had all met in a place where no one could have expected a meeting . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he bade him , too , turn his eyes upon the beauty of dorothea and he would see that few if any could equal much less excel her; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and the surpassing love she bore him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but besides all this , he reminded him that if he prided himself on being a gentleman and a christian , he could not do otherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doing so he would obey god and meet the approval of all sensible people , who know and recognised it to be the privilege of beauty , even in one of humble birth , provided virtue accompany it , to be able to raise itself to the level of any rank , without any slur upon him who places it upon an equality with himself; and furthermore that when the potent sway of passion asserts itself , so long as there be no mixture of sin in it , he is not to be blamed who gives way to it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to be brief , they added to these such other forcible arguments that don fernando s manly heart , being after all nourished by noble blood , was touched , and yielded to the truth which , even had he wished it , he could not gainsay; and he showed his submission , and acceptance of the good advice that had been offered to him , by stooping down and embracing dorothea , saying to her ,  - rise , dear lady , it is not right that what i hold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and if until now i have shown no sign of what i own , it may have been by heaven s decree in order that , seeing the constancy with which you love me , i may learn to value you as you deserve . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> not so luscinda , and cardenio , and almost all the others , for they shed so many tears , some in their own happiness , some at that of the others , that one would have supposed a heavy calamity had fallen upon them all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> even sancho panza was weeping; though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that dorothea was not as he fancied the queen micomicona , of whom he expected such great favours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time , and then cardenio and luscinda went and fell on their knees before don fernando , returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in language so grateful that he knew not how to answer them , and raising them up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when she had finished don fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after he had found in luscinda s bosom the paper in which she declared that she was cardenio s wife , and never could be his . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said he meant to kill her , and would have done so had he not been prevented by her parents , and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame , and resolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should offer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> finally , at the end of some months he ascertained that she was in a convent and meant to remain there all the rest of her life , if she were not to share it with cardenio; and as soon as he had learned this , taking these three gentlemen as his companions , he arrived at the place where she was , but avoided speaking to her , fearing that if it were known he was there stricter precautions would be taken in the convent; and watching a time when the porter s lodge was open he left two to guard the gate , and he and the other entered the convent in quest of luscinda , whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of the nuns , and carrying her off without giving her time to resist , they reached a place with her where they provided themselves with what they required for taking her away; all which they were able to do in complete safety , as the convent was in the country at a considerable distance from the city . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he added that when luscinda found herself in his power she lost all consciousness , and after returning to herself did nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a word; and thus in silence and tears they reached that inn , which for him was reaching heaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea was unable to persuade herself that her present happiness was not all a dream; cardenio was in a similar state of mind , and luscinda s thoughts ran in the same direction . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don fernando gave thanks to heaven for the favour shown to him and for having been rescued from the intricate labyrinth in which he had been brought so near the destruction of his good name and of his soul; and in short everybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicated and hopeless business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curate as a sensible man made sound reflections upon the whole affair , and congratulated each upon his good fortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humour was the landlady , because of the promise cardenio and the curate had given her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustained through don quixote s means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho , as has been already said , was the only one who was distressed , unhappy , and dejected; and so with a long face he went in to his master , who had just awoke , and said to him: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - like red wine , your worship had better say , replied sancho;  - for i would have you know , if you don t know it , that the dead giant is a hacked wine - skin , and the blood four - and - twenty gallons of red wine that it had in its belly , and the cut - off head is the bitch that bore me; and the devil take it all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i could believe all that , replied sancho ,  - if my blanketing was the same sort of thing also; only it wasn t , but real and genuine; for i saw the landlord , who is here to - day , holding one end of the blanket and jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly , and with as much laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing people , i hold for my part , simple and sinner as i am , that there is no enchantment about it at all , but a great deal of bruising and bad luck . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well , well , god will give a remedy , said don quixote;  - hand me my clothes and let me go out , for i want to see these transformations and things thou speakest of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he described to them also nearly all the adventures that sancho had mentioned , at which they marvelled and laughed not a little , thinking it , as all did , the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could be capable of . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but now , the curate said , that the lady dorothea s good fortune prevented her from proceeding with their purpose , it would be necessary to devise or discover some other way of getting him home . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said don fernando ,  - that must not be , for i want dorothea to follow out this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman s village is not very far off , i shall be happy if i can do anything for his relief . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is not more than two days  journey from this , said the curate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - even if it were more , said don fernando ,  - i would gladly travel so far for the sake of doing so good a work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this moment don quixote came out in full panoply , with mambrino s helmet , all dinted as it was , on his head , his buckler on his arm , and leaning on his staff or pike . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the strange figure he presented filled don fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean yellow face half a league long , his armour of all sorts , and the solemnity of his deportment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they stood silent waiting to see what he would say , and he , fixing his eyes on the fair dorothea , addressed her with great gravity and composure: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am informed , fair lady , by my squire here that your greatness has been annihilated and your being abolished , since , from a queen and lady of high degree as you used to be , you have been turned into a private maiden . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if this has been done by the command of the magician king your father , through fear that i should not afford you the aid you need and are entitled to , i may tell you he did not know and does not know half the mass , and was little versed in the annals of chivalry; for , if he had read and gone through them as attentively and deliberately as i have , he would have found at every turn that knights of less renown than mine have accomplished things more difficult: it is no great matter to kill a whelp of a giant , however arrogant he may be; for it is not many hours since i myself was engaged with one , andi will not speak of it , that they may not say i am lying; time , however , that reveals all , will tell the tale when we least expect it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you were engaged with a couple of wine - skins , and not a giant , said the landlord at this; but don fernando told him to hold his tongue and on no account interrupt don quixote , who continued ,  - i say in conclusion , high and disinherited lady , that if your father has brought about this metamorphosis in your person for the reason i have mentioned , you ought not to attach any importance to it; for there is no peril on earth through which my sword will not force a way , and with it , before many days are over , i will bring your enemy s head to the ground and place on yours the crown of your kingdom . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote said no more , and waited for the reply of the princess , who aware of don fernando s determination to carry on the deception until don quixote had been conveyed to his home , with great ease of manner and gravity made answer ,  - whoever told you , valiant knight of the rueful countenance , that i had undergone any change or transformation did not tell you the truth , for i am the same as i was yesterday . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true that certain strokes of good fortune , that have given me more than i could have hoped for , have made some alteration in me; but i have not therefore ceased to be what i was before , or to entertain the same desire i have had all through of availing myself of the might of your valiant and invincible arm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so , seor , let your goodness reinstate the father that begot me in your good opinion , and be assured that he was a wise and prudent man , since by his craft he found out such a sure and easy way of remedying my misfortune; for i believe , seor , that had it not been for you i should never have lit upon the good fortune i now possess; and in this i am saying what is perfectly true; as most of these gentlemen who are present can fully testify . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that remains is to set out on our journey to - morrow , for to - day we could not make much way; and for the rest of the happy result i am looking forward to , i trust to god and the valour of your heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so said the sprightly dorothea , and on hearing her don quixote turned to sancho , and said to him , with an angry air ,  - i declare now , little sancho , thou art the greatest little villain in spain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> say , thief and vagabond , hast thou not just now told me that this princess had been turned into a maiden called dorothea , and that the head which i am persuaded i cut off from a giant was the bitch that bore thee , and other nonsense that put me in the greatest perplexity i have ever been in all my life? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let your worship be calm , seor , returned sancho ,  - for it may well be that i have been mistaken as to the change of the lady princess micomicona; but as to the giant s head , or at least as to the piercing of the wine - skins , and the blood being red wine , i make no mistake , as sure as there is a god; because the wounded skins are there at the head of your worship s bed , and the wine has made a lake of the room; if not you will see when the eggs come to be fried; i mean when his worship the landlord calls for all the damages: for the rest , i am heartily glad that her ladyship the queen is as she was , for it concerns me as much as anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i tell thee again , sancho , thou art a fool , said don quixote;  - forgive me , and that will do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is i who shall wait upon and accompany you , said don quixote;  - and i am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me , and the good opinion entertained of me , which i shall strive to justify or it shall cost me my life , or even more , if it can possibly cost me more . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> behind him , mounted upon an ass , there came a woman dressed in moorish fashion , with her face veiled and a scarf on her head , and wearing a little brocaded cap , and a mantle that covered her from her shoulders to her feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man was of a robust and well - proportioned frame , in age a little over forty , rather swarthy in complexion , with long moustaches and a full beard , and , in short , his appearance was such that if he had been well dressed he would have been taken for a person of quality and good birth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on entering he asked for a room , and when they told him there was none in the inn he seemed distressed , and approaching her who by her dress seemed to be a moor , he took her down from the saddle in his arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> luscinda , dorothea , the landlady , her daughter and maritornes , attracted by the strange , and to them entirely new costume , gathered round her; and dorothea , who was always kindly , courteous , and quick - witted , perceiving that both she and the man who had brought her were annoyed at not finding a room , said to her ,  - do not be put out , seora , by the discomfort and want of luxuries here , for it is the way of road - side inns to be without them; still , if you will be pleased to share our lodging with us ( pointing to luscinda ) perhaps you will have found worse accommodation in the course of your journey . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> from her silence they concluded that she must be a moor and unable to speak a christian tongue . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - nothing has been asked of her , returned luscinda;  - she has only been offered our company for this evening and a share of the quarters we occupy , where she shall be made as comfortable as the circumstances allow , with the good - will we are bound to show all strangers that stand in need of it , especially if it be a woman to whom the service is rendered . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - tell me , seor , said dorothea ,  - is this lady a christian or a moor? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for her dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what we could wish she was not . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then she has not been baptised? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> returned luscinda . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by these words he excited a desire in all who heard him , to know who the moorish lady and the captive were , but no one liked to ask just then , seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest themselves than for questioning them about their lives . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea took the moorish lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself , requested her to remove her veil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she looked at the captive as if to ask him what they meant and what she was to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he said to her in arabic that they asked her to take off her veil , and thereupon she removed it and disclosed a countenance so lovely , that to dorothea she seemed more beautiful than luscinda , and to luscinda more beautiful than dorothea , and all the bystanders felt that if any beauty could compare with theirs it was the moorish lady s , and there were even those who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as it is the privilege and charm of beauty to win the heart and secure good - will , all forthwith became eager to show kindness and attention to the lovely moor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don fernando asked the captive what her name was , and he replied that it was lela zoraida; but the instant she heard him , she guessed what the christian had asked , and said hastily , with some displeasure and energy ,  - no , not zoraida; maria , maria! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> giving them to understand that she was called  - maria and not  - zoraida . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these words , and the touching earnestness with which she uttered them , drew more than one tear from some of the listeners , particularly the women , who are by nature tender - hearted and compassionate . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the hour therefore having arrived they all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one , for round or square table there was none in the inn , and the seat of honour at the head of it , though he was for refusing it , they assigned to don quixote , who desired the lady micomicona to place herself by his side , as he was her protector . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and so they supped in high enjoyment , which was increased when they observed don quixote leave off eating , and , moved by an impulse like that which made him deliver himself at such length when he supped with the goatherds , begin to address them: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - verily , gentlemen , if we reflect upon it , great and marvellous are the things they see , who make profession of the order of knight - errantry . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> say , what being is there in this world , who entering the gate of this castle at this moment , and seeing us as we are here , would suppose or imagine us to be what we are? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for the reason which such persons commonly assign , and upon which they chiefly rest , is , that the labours of the mind are greater than those of the body , and that arms give employment to the body alone; as if the calling were a porter s trade , for which nothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as if , in what we who profess them call arms , there were not included acts of vigour for the execution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul of the warrior , when he has an army , or the defence of a city under his care , did not exert itself as much by mind as by body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> since , therefore , arms have need of the mind , as much as letters , let us see now which of the two minds , that of the man of letters or that of the warrior , has most to do; and this will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that purpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this peace is the true end of war; and war is only another name for arms . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , then , being admitted , that the end of war is peace , and that so far it has the advantage of the end of letters , let us turn to the bodily labours of the man of letters , and those of him who follows the profession of arms , and see which are the greater . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by this road that i have described , rough and hard , stumbling here , falling there , getting up again to fall again , they reach the rank they desire , and that once attained , we have seen many who have passed these syrtes and scyllas and charybdises , as if borne flying on the wings of favouring fortune; we have seen them , i say , ruling and governing the world from a chair , their hunger turned into satiety , their cold into comfort , their nakedness into fine raiment , their sleep on a mat into repose in holland and damask , the justly earned reward of their virtue; but , contrasted and compared with what the warrior undergoes , all they have undergone falls far short of it , as i am now about to show . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> continuing his discourse don quixote said:  - as we began in the student s case with poverty and its accompaniments , let us see now if the soldier is richer , and we shall find that in poverty itself there is no one poorer; for he is dependent on his miserable pay , which comes late or never , or else on what he can plunder , seriously imperilling his life and conscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great that a slashed doublet serves him for uniform and shirt , and in the depth of winter he has to defend himself against the inclemency of the weather in the open field with nothing better than the breath of his mouth , which i need not say , coming from an empty place , must come out cold , contrary to the laws of nature . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to be sure he looks forward to the approach of night to make up for all these discomforts on the bed that awaits him , which , unless by some fault of his , never sins by being over narrow , for he can easily measure out on the ground as he likes , and roll himself about in it to his heart s content without any fear of the sheets slipping away from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for tell me , sirs , if you have ever reflected upon it , by how much do those who have gained by war fall short of the number of those who have perished in it? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> no doubt you will reply that there can be no comparison , that the dead cannot be numbered , while the living who have been rewarded may be summed up with three figures . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all which is the reverse in the case of men of letters; for by skirts , to say nothing of sleeves , they all find means of support; so that though the soldier has more to endure , his reward is much less . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - putting this , however , aside , for it is a puzzling question for which it is difficult to find a solution , let us return to the superiority of arms over letters , a matter still undecided , so many are the arguments put forward on each side; for besides those i have mentioned , letters say that without them arms cannot maintain themselves , for war , too , has its laws and is governed by them , and laws belong to the domain of letters and men of letters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this arms make answer that without them laws cannot be maintained , for by arms states are defended , kingdoms preserved , cities protected , roads made safe , seas cleared of pirates; and , in short , if it were not for them , states , kingdoms , monarchies , cities , ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence and confusion which war brings with it , so long as it lasts and is free to make use of its privileges and powers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and then it is plain that whatever costs most is valued and deserves to be valued most . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to attain to eminence in letters costs a man time , watching , hunger , nakedness , headaches , indigestions , and other things of the sort , some of which i have already referred to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but for a man to come in the ordinary course of things to be a good soldier costs him all the student suffers , and in an incomparably higher degree , for at every step he runs the risk of losing his life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for what dread of want or poverty that can reach or harass the student can compare with what the soldier feels , who finds himself beleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin or cavalier , knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post where he is stationed , and cannot under any circumstances retire or fly from the imminent danger that threatens him? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all he can do is to inform his captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by a counter - mine , and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the moment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into the deep against his will . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> happy the blest ages that knew not the dread fury of those devilish engines of artillery , whose inventor i am persuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention , by which he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life of a gallant gentleman; and that , when he knows not how or whence , in the height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave hearts , there should come some random bullet , discharged perhaps by one who fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine , which in an instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life of one who deserved to live for ages to come . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and thus when i reflect on this , i am almost tempted to say that in my heart i repent of having adopted this profession of knight - errant in so detestable an age as we live in now; for though no peril can make me fear , still it gives me some uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of the opportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout the known earth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this lengthy discourse don quixote delivered while the others supped , forgetting to raise a morsel to his lips , though sancho more than once told him to eat his supper , as he would have time enough afterwards to say all he wanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it excited fresh pity in those who had heard him to see a man of apparently sound sense , and with rational views on every subject he discussed , so hopelessly wanting in all , when his wretched unlucky chivalry was in question . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this the captive replied that he would very willingly yield to his request , only he feared his tale would not give them as much pleasure as he wished; nevertheless , not to be wanting in compliance , he would tell it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curate and the others thanked him and added their entreaties , and he finding himself so pressed said there was no occasion to ask , where a command had such weight , and added ,  - if your worships will give me your attention you will hear a true story which , perhaps , fictitious ones constructed with ingenious and studied art cannot come up to . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these words made them settle themselves in their places and preserve a deep silence , and he seeing them waiting on his words in mute expectation , began thus in a pleasant quiet voice . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my family had its origin in a village in the mountains of leon , and nature had been kinder and more generous to it than fortune; though in the general poverty of those communities my father passed for being even a rich man; and he would have been so in reality had he been as clever in preserving his property as he was in spending it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this tendency of his to be liberal and profuse he had acquired from having been a soldier in his youth , for the soldier s life is a school in which the niggard becomes free - handed and the free - handed prodigal; and if any soldiers are to be found who are misers , they are monsters of rare occurrence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> my father went beyond liberality and bordered on prodigality , a disposition by no means advantageous to a married man who has children to succeed to his name and position . </s> </s>

<s> <s> you are now of an age to choose your line of life or at least make choice of a calling that will bring you honour and profit when you are older; and what i have resolved to do is to divide my property into four parts; three i will give to you , to each his portion without making any difference , and the other i will retain to live upon and support myself for whatever remainder of life heaven may be pleased to grant me . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  i say so because it is my will and pleasure that one of you should follow letters , another trade , and the third serve the king in the wars , for it is a difficult matter to gain admission to his service in his household , and if war does not bring much wealth it confers great distinction and fame . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was known as a fact that the most serene don john of austria , natural brother of our good king don philip , was coming as commander - in - chief of the allied forces , and rumours were abroad of the vast warlike preparations which were being made , all which stirred my heart and filled me with a longing to take part in the campaign which was expected; and though i had reason to believe , and almost certain promises , that on the first opportunity that presented itself i should be promoted to be captain , i preferred to leave all and betake myself , as i did , to italy; and it was my good fortune that don john had just arrived at genoa , and was going on to naples to join the venetian fleet , as he afterwards did at messina . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they carried me to constantinople , where the grand turk , selim , made my master general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and carried off as evidence of his bravery the standard of the order of malta . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the following year , which was the year seventy - two , i found myself at navarino rowing in the leading galley with the three lanterns . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> there i saw and observed how the opportunity of capturing the whole turkish fleet in harbour was lost; for all the marines and janizzaries that belonged to it made sure that they were about to be attacked inside the very harbour , and had their kits and pasamaques , or shoes , ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be assailed , in so great fear did they stand of our fleet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but heaven ordered it otherwise , not for any fault or neglect of the general who commanded on our side , but for the sins of christendom , and because it was god s will and pleasure that we should always have instruments of punishment to chastise us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as it was , el uchali took refuge at modon , which is an island near navarino , and landing forces fortified the mouth of the harbour and waited quietly until don john retired . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this expedition was taken the galley called the prize , whose captain was a son of the famous corsair barbarossa . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was taken by the chief neapolitan galley called the she - wolf , commanded by that thunderbolt of war , that father of his men , that successful and unconquered captain don alvaro de bazan , marquis of santa cruz; and i cannot help telling you what took place at the capture of the prize . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the son of barbarossa was so cruel , and treated his slaves so badly , that , when those who were at the oars saw that the she - wolf galley was bearing down upon them and gaining upon them , they all at once dropped their oars and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end of the gangway shouting to them to row lustily; and passing him on from bench to bench , from the poop to the prow , they so bit him that before he had got much past the mast his soul had already got to hell; so great , as i said , was the cruelty with which he treated them , and the hatred with which they hated him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> while all these events were occurring , i was labouring at the oar without any hope of freedom; at least i had no hope of obtaining it by ransom , for i was firmly resolved not to write to my father telling him of my misfortunes . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first to fall was the goletta , until then reckoned impregnable , and it fell , not by any fault of its defenders , who did all that they could and should have done , but because experiment proved how easily entrenchments could be made in the desert sand there; for water used to be found at two palms depth , while the turks found none at two yards; and so by means of a quantity of sandbags they raised their works so high that they commanded the walls of the fort , sweeping them as if from a cavalier , so that no one was able to make a stand or maintain the defence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves up in the goletta , but should have waited in the open at the landing - place; but those who say so talk at random and with little knowledge of such matters; for if in the goletta and in the fort there were barely seven thousand soldiers , how could such a small number , however resolute , sally out and hold their own against numbers like those of the enemy? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the fort also fell; but the turks had to win it inch by inch , for the soldiers who defended it fought so gallantly and stoutly that the number of the enemy killed in twenty - two general assaults exceeded twenty - five thousand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they took prisoner don pedro puertocarrero , commandant of the goletta , who had done all in his power to defend his fortress , and took the loss of it so much to heart that he died of grief on the way to constantinople , where they were carrying him a prisoner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they also took the commandant of the fort , gabrio cerbellon by name , a milanese gentleman , a great engineer and a very brave soldier . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in these two fortresses perished many persons of note , among whom was pagano doria , knight of the order of st . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> john , a man of generous disposition , as was shown by his extreme liberality to his brother , the famous john andrea doria; and what made his death the more sad was that he was slain by some arabs to whom , seeing that the fort was now lost , he entrusted himself , and who offered to conduct him in the disguise of a moor to tabarca , a small fort or station on the coast held by the genoese employed in the coral fishery . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all i know is , replied the captive ,  - that after having been in constantinople two years , he escaped in the disguise of an arnaut , in company with a greek spy; but whether he regained his liberty or not i cannot tell , though i fancy he did , because a year afterwards i saw the greek at constantinople , though i was unable to ask him what the result of the journey was . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well then , you are right , returned the gentleman ,  - for that don pedro is my brother , and he is now in our village in good health , rich , married , and with three children . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - thanks be to god for all the mercies he has shown him , said the captive;  - for to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with recovering lost liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what is more , said the gentleman ,  - i know the sonnets my brother made . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - then let your worship repeat them , said the captive ,  - for you will recite them better than i can . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - well then , that on the fort , said the gentleman ,  - if my memory serves me , goes thus: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the goletta and the fort being thus in their hands , the turks gave orders to dismantle the golettafor the fort was reduced to such a state that there was nothing left to leveland to do the work more quickly and easily they mined it in three places; but nowhere were they able to blow up the part which seemed to be the least strong , that is to say , the old walls , while all that remained standing of the new fortifications that the fratin had made came to the ground with the greatest ease . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> finally the fleet returned victorious and triumphant to constantinople , and a few months later died my master , el uchali , otherwise uchali fartax , which means in turkish  - the scabby renegade; for that he was; it is the practice with the turks to name people from some defect or virtue they may possess; the reason being that there are among them only four surnames belonging to families tracing their descent from the ottoman house , and the others , as i have said , take their names and surnames either from bodily blemishes or moral qualities . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this  - scabby one rowed at the oar as a slave of the grand signor s for fourteen years , and when over thirty - four years of age , in resentment at having been struck by a turk while at the oar , turned renegade and renounced his faith in order to be able to revenge himself; and such was his valour that , without owing his advancement to the base ways and means by which most favourites of the grand signor rise to power , he came to be king of algiers , and afterwards general - on - sea , which is the third place of trust in the realm . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he was a calabrian by birth , and a worthy man morally , and he treated his slaves with great humanity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i fell to the lot of a venetian renegade who , when a cabin boy on board a ship , had been taken by uchali and was so much beloved by him that he became one of his most favoured youths . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he came to be the most cruel renegade i ever saw: his name was hassan aga , and he grew very rich and became king of algiers . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with him i went there from constantinople , rather glad to be so near spain , not that i intended to write to anyone about my unhappy lot , but to try if fortune would be kinder to me in algiers than in constantinople , where i had attempted in a thousand ways to escape without ever finding a favourable time or chance; but in algiers i resolved to seek for other means of effecting the purpose i cherished so dearly; for the hope of obtaining my liberty never deserted me; and when in my plots and schemes and attempts the result did not answer my expectations , without giving way to despair i immediately began to look out for or conjure up some new hope to support me , however faint or feeble it might be . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they put a chain on me , more as a mark of this than to keep me safe , and so i passed my life in that bano with several other gentlemen and persons of quality marked out as held to ransom; but though at times , or rather almost always , we suffered from hunger and scanty clothing , nothing distressed us so much as hearing and seeing at every turn the unexampled and unheard - of cruelties my master inflicted upon the christians . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it so happened , then , that as i was one day on the terrace of our prison with three other comrades , trying , to pass away the time , how far we could leap with our chains , we being alone , for all the other christians had gone out to work , i chanced to raise my eyes , and from one of these little closed windows i saw a reed appear with a cloth attached to the end of it , and it kept waving to and fro , and moving as if making signs to us to come and take it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we watched it , and one of those who were with me went and stood under the reed to see whether they would let it drop , or what they would do , but as he did so the reed was raised and moved from side to side , as if they meant to say  - no by a shake of the head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the christian came back , and it was again lowered , making the same movements as before . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> another of my comrades went , and with him the same happened as with the first , and then the third went forward , but with the same result as the first and second . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is needless to say i rejoiced over this godsend , and my joy was not less than my wonder as i strove to imagine how this good fortune could have come to us , but to me specially; for the evident unwillingness to drop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the favour was intended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i took my welcome money , broke the reed , and returned to the terrace , and looking up at the window , i saw a very white hand put out that opened and shut very quickly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> shortly afterwards at the same window a small cross made of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this sign led us to believe that some christian woman was a captive in the house , and that it was she who had been so good to us; but the whiteness of the hand and the bracelets we had perceived made us dismiss that idea , though we thought it might be one of the christian renegades whom their masters very often take as lawful wives , and gladly , for they prefer them to the women of their own nation . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in all our conjectures we were wide of the truth; so from that time forward our sole occupation was watching and gazing at the window where the cross had appeared to us , as if it were our pole - star; but at least fifteen days passed without our seeing either it or the hand , or any other sign and though meanwhile we endeavoured with the utmost pains to ascertain who it was that lived in the house , and whether there were any christian renegade in it , nobody could ever tell us anything more than that he who lived there was a rich moor of high position , hadji morato by name , formerly alcaide of la pata , an office of high dignity among them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but when we least thought it was going to rain any more cianis from that quarter , we saw the reed suddenly appear with another cloth tied in a larger knot attached to it , and this at a time when , as on the former occasion , the bano was deserted and unoccupied . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we made trial as before , each of the same three going forward before i did; but the reed was delivered to none but me , and on my approach it was let drop . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i untied the knot and i found forty spanish gold crowns with a paper written in arabic , and at the end of the writing there was a large cross drawn . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i kissed the cross , took the crowns and returned to the terrace , and we all made our salaams; again the hand appeared , i made signs that i would read the paper , and then the window was closed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we were all puzzled , though filled with joy at what had taken place; and as none of us understood arabic , great was our curiosity to know what the paper contained , and still greater the difficulty of finding some one to read it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> others , however , there are who procure these papers and make use of them honestly , and remain on christian soil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i knew that he understood arabic very well , and could not only speak but also write it; but before i disclosed the whole matter to him , i asked him to read for me this paper which i had found by accident in a hole in my cell . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he opened it and remained some time examining it and muttering to himself as he translated it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i asked him if he understood it , and he told me he did perfectly well , and that if i wished him to tell me its meaning word for word , i must give him pen and ink that he might do it more satisfactorily . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - all that is here in spanish is what the moorish paper contains , and you must bear in mind that when it says lela marien  it means our lady the virgin mary . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - when i was a child my father had a slave who taught me to pray the christian prayer in my own language , and told me many things about lela marien . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the christian died , and i know that she did not go to the fire , but to allah , because since then i have seen her twice , and she told me to go to the land of the christians to see lela marien , who had great love for me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i have seen many christians , but except thyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am young and beautiful , and have plenty of money to take with me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i am greatly troubled on this account , for i would not have thee confide in anyone , because if my father knew it he would at once fling me down a well and cover me with stones . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she and allah and this cross , which i often kiss as the captive bade me , protect thee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> judge , sirs , whether we had reason for surprise and joy at the words of this paper; and both one and the other were so great , that the renegade perceived that the paper had not been found by chance , but had been in reality addressed to some one of us , and he begged us , if what he suspected were the truth , to trust him and tell him all , for he would risk his life for our freedom; and so saying he took out from his breast a metal crucifix , and with many tears swore by the god the image represented , in whom , sinful and wicked as he was , he truly and faithfully believed , to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever we chose to reveal to him; for he thought and almost foresaw that by means of her who had written that paper , he and all of us would obtain our liberty , and he himself obtain the object he so much desired , his restoration to the bosom of the holy mother church , from which by his own sin and ignorance he was now severed like a corrupt limb . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the renegade said this with so many tears and such signs of repentance , that with one consent we all agreed to tell him the whole truth of the matter , and so we gave him a full account of all , without hiding anything from him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we agreed also that it would be advisable to answer the moorish lady s letter , and the renegade without a moment s delay took down the words i dictated to him , which were exactly what i shall tell you , for nothing of importance that took place in this affair has escaped my memory , or ever will while life lasts . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this , then , was the answer returned to the moorish lady: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> entreat her that she be pleased to show thee how thou canst execute the command she gives thee , for she will , such is her goodness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> allah and marien his mother watch over thee , my lady . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as soon as i saw it , although i could not distinguish who put it out , i showed the paper as a sign to attach the thread , but it was already fixed to the reed , and to it i tied the paper; and shortly afterwards our star once more made its appearance with the white flag of peace , the little bundle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was dropped , and i picked it up , and found in the cloth , in gold and silver coins of all sorts , more than fifty crowns , which fifty times more strengthened our joy and doubled our hope of gaining our liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we immediately took counsel with the renegade as to what means would have to be adopted in order to carry off the moorish lady and bring us all to christian territory; and in the end it was agreed that for the present we should wait for a second communication from zoraida ( for that was the name of her who now desires to be called maria ) , because we saw clearly that she and no one else could find a way out of all these difficulties . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> reed and cloth came down to me , and i found another paper and a hundred crowns in gold , without any other coin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i cannot think of a plan , seor , for our going to spain , nor has lela marien shown me one , though i have asked her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all that can be done is for me to give you plenty of money in gold from this window . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> you can carry me away from there by night without any danger , and bring me to the vessel . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and remember thou art to be my husband , else i will pray to marien to punish thee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if thou canst not trust anyone to go for the vessel , ransom thyself and do thou go , for i know thou wilt return more surely than any other , as thou art a gentleman and a christian . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> endeavour to make thyself acquainted with the garden; and when i see thee walking yonder i shall know that the bano is empty and i will give thee abundance of money . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these were the words and contents of the second paper , and on hearing them , each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one , and promised to go and return with scrupulous good faith; and i too made the same offer; but to all this the renegade objected , saying that he would not on any account consent to one being set free before all went together , as experience had taught him how ill those who have been set free keep promises which they made in captivity; for captives of distinction frequently had recourse to this plan , paying the ransom of one who was to go to valencia or majorca with money to enable him to arm a bark and return for the others who had ransomed him , but who never came back; for recovered liberty and the dread of losing it again efface from the memory all the obligations in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and to prove the truth of what he said , he told us briefly what had happened to a certain christian gentleman almost at that very time , the strangest case that had ever occurred even there , where astonishing and marvellous things are happening every instant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this however he could get over by arranging with a tagarin moor to go shares with him in the purchase of the vessel , and in the profit on the cargo; and under cover of this he could become master of the vessel , in which case he looked upon all the rest as accomplished . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but though to me and my comrades it had seemed a better plan to send to majorca for the vessel , as the moorish lady suggested , we did not dare to oppose him , fearing that if we did not do as he said he would denounce us , and place us in danger of losing all our lives if he were to disclose our dealings with zoraida , for whose life we would have all given our own . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i renewed my promise to be her husband; and thus the next day that the bano chanced to be empty she at different times gave us by means of the reed and cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper in which she said that the next juma , that is to say friday , she was going to her father s garden , but that before she went she would give us more money; and if it were not enough we were to let her know , as she would give us as much as we asked , for her father had so much he would not miss it , and besides she kept all the keys . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in fact my master was so difficult to deal with that i dared not on any account pay down the money at once . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i answered in a few words that i would do so , and that she must remember to commend us to lela marien with all the prayers the captive had taught her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but for my part i should have been sorry if he had spoken to her , for perhaps it might have alarmed her to find her affairs talked of by renegades . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but god , who ordered it otherwise , afforded no opportunity for our renegade s well - meant purpose; and he , seeing how safely he could go to shershel and return , and anchor when and how and where he liked , and that the tagarin his partner had no will but his , and that , now i was ransomed , all we wanted was to find some christians to row , told me to look out for any i should he willing to take with me , over and above those who had been ransomed , and to engage them for the next friday , which he fixed upon for our departure . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this i spoke to twelve spaniards , all stout rowers , and such as could most easily leave the city; but it was no easy matter to find so many just then , because there were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the rowers with them; and these would not have been found were it not that their master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order to finish a galliot that he had upon the stocks . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to these men i said nothing more than that the next friday in the evening they were to come out stealthily one by one and hang about hadji morato s garden , waiting for me there until i came . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this preliminary having been settled , another still more necessary step had to be taken , which was to let zoraida know how matters stood that she might be prepared and forewarned , so as not to be taken by surprise if we were suddenly to seize upon her before she thought the christians  vessel could have returned . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the first person i met was her father , who addressed me in the language that all over barbary and even in constantinople is the medium between captives and moors , and is neither morisco nor castilian , nor of any other nation , but a mixture of all languages , by means of which we can all understand one another . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in this sort of language , i say , he asked me what i wanted in his garden , and to whom i belonged . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i replied that i was a slave of the arnaut mami ( for i knew as a certainty that he was a very great friend of his ) , and that i wanted some herbs to make a salad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> i will content myself with saying that more pearls hung from her fair neck , her ears , and her hair than she had hairs on her head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the pearls were in profusion and very fine , for the highest display and adornment of the moorish women is decking themselves with rich pearls and seed - pearls; and of these there are therefore more among the moors than among any other people . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> zoraida s father had to the reputation of possessing a great number , and the purest in all algiers , and of possessing also more than two hundred thousand spanish crowns; and she , who is now mistress of me only , was mistress of all this . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as she approached her father told her in his own language that i was a captive belonging to his friend the arnaut mami , and that i had come for salad . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that may be , lady , said i;  - but indeed i dealt truthfully with my master , as i do and mean to do with everybody in the world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said zoraida . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - to - morrow , i think , said i ,  - for there is a vessel here from france which sails to - morrow , and i think i shall go in her . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - would it not be better , said zoraida ,  - to wait for the arrival of ships from spain and go with them and not with the french who are not your friends? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no , said i;  - though if there were intelligence that a vessel were now coming from spain it is true i might , perhaps , wait for it; however , it is more likely i shall depart to - morrow , for the longing i feel to return to my country and to those i love is so great that it will not allow me to wait for another opportunity , however more convenient , if it be delayed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - no doubt thou art married in thine own country , said zoraida ,  - and for that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i am not married , i replied ,  - but i have given my promise to marry on my arrival there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said zoraida . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so beautiful , said i ,  - that , to describe her worthily and tell thee the truth , she is very like thee . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> zoraida s father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of these words and phrases , for though she spoke the bastard language , that , as i have said , is employed there , she expressed her meaning more by signs than by words . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the old man was alarmed and zoraida too , for the moors commonly , and , so to speak , instinctively have a dread of the turks , but particularly of the soldiers , who are so insolent and domineering to the moors who are under their power that they treat them worse than if they were their slaves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> her father said to zoraida ,  - daughter , retire into the house and shut thyself in while i go and speak to these dogs; and thou , christian , pick thy herbs , and go in peace , and allah bring thee safe to thy own country . </s> </s>

<s> <s> i asked the renegade what had passed between them , and when he told me , i declared that nothing should be done except in accordance with the wishes of zoraida , who now came back with a little trunk so full of gold crowns that she could scarcely carry it . </s> </s>

<s> <s> to be brief , those who had gone upstairs acted so promptly that in an instant they came down , carrying hadji morato with his hands bound and a napkin tied over his mouth , which prevented him from uttering a word , warning him at the same time that to attempt to speak would cost him his life . </s> </s>

<s> <s> it was barely two hours after night set in when we were all on board the vessel , where the cords were removed from the hands of zoraida s father , and the napkin from his mouth; but the renegade once more told him not to utter a word , or they would take his life . </s> </s>

<s> <s> finding herself now on board , and that we were about to give way with the oars , zoraida , seeing her father there , and the other moors bound , bade the renegade ask me to do her the favour of releasing the moors and setting her father at liberty , for she would rather drown herself in the sea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to be carried away captive before her eyes and on her account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on this point we all agreed; and zoraida , to whom it was explained , together with the reasons that prevented us from doing at once what she desired , was satisfied likewise; and then in glad silence and with cheerful alacrity each of our stout rowers took his oar , and commending ourselves to god with all our hearts , we began to shape our course for the island of majorca , the nearest christian land . </s> </s>

<s> <s> we might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some three musket - shots off the land , which seemed to us deserted , and without anyone to see us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for all that , however , by hard rowing we put out a little to sea , for it was now somewhat calmer , and having gained about two leagues the word was given to row by batches , while we ate something , for the vessel was well provided; but the rowers said it was not a time to take any rest; let food be served out to those who were not rowing , but they would not leave their oars on any account . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this was done , but now a stiff breeze began to blow , which obliged us to leave off rowing and make sail at once and steer for oran , as it was impossible to make any other course . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this was done very promptly , and under sail we ran more than eight miles an hour without any fear , except that of coming across some vessel out on a roving expedition . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we gave the moorish rowers some food , and the renegade comforted them by telling them that they were not held as captives , as we should set them free on the first opportunity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the same was said to zoraida s father , who replied ,  - anything else , christian , i might hope for or think likely from your generosity and good behaviour , but do not think me so simple as to imagine you will give me my liberty; for you would have never exposed yourselves to the danger of depriving me of it only to restore it to me so generously , especially as you know who i am and the sum you may expect to receive on restoring it; and if you will only name that , i here offer you all you require for myself and for my unhappy daughter there; or else for her alone , for she is the greatest and most precious part of my soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> as he said this he began to weep so bitterly that he filled us all with compassion and forced zoraida to look at him , and when she saw him weeping she was so moved that she rose from my feet and ran to throw her arms round him , and pressing her face to his , they both gave way to such an outburst of tears that several of us were constrained to keep them company . </s> </s>

<s> <s> to which the renegade , without waiting for zoraida to reply , made answer ,  - do not trouble thyself by asking thy daughter zoraida so many questions , seor , for the one answer i will give thee will serve for all; i would have thee know that she is a christian , and that it is she who has been the file for our chains and our deliverer from captivity . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> she is here of her own free will , as glad , i imagine , to find herself in this position as he who escapes from darkness into the light , from death to life , and from suffering to glory . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cried the moor . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which zoraida made answer ,  - a christian i am , but it is not i who have placed thee in this position , for it never was my wish to leave thee or do thee harm , but only to do good to myself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - and what good hast thou done thyself , daughter? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said he . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the moor had hardly heard these words when with marvellous quickness he flung himself headforemost into the sea , where no doubt he would have been drowned had not the long and full dress he wore held him up for a little on the surface of the water . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> zoraida cried aloud to us to save him , and we all hastened to help , and seizing him by his robe we drew him in half drowned and insensible , at which zoraida was in such distress that she wept over him as piteously and bitterly as though he were already dead . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> meanwhile , the wind having changed we were compelled to head for the land , and ply our oars to avoid being driven on shore; but it was our good fortune to reach a creek that lies on one side of a small promontory or cape , called by the moors that of the  - cava rumia , which in our language means  - the wicked christian woman; for it is a tradition among them that la cava , through whom spain was lost , lies buried at that spot;  - cava in their language meaning  - wicked woman , and  - rumia  - christian; moreover , they count it unlucky to anchor there when necessity compels them , and they never do so otherwise . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we promised her to do this at the moment of departure , for as it was uninhabited we ran no risk in releasing them at that place . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> seeing this we unbound the moors , and one by one put them on shore , at which they were filled with amazement; but when we came to land zoraida s father , who had now completely recovered his senses , he said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - why is it , think ye , christians , that this wicked woman is rejoiced at your giving me my liberty? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> think ye it is because of the affection she bears me? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nay verily , it is only because of the hindrance my presence offers to the execution of her base designs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and think not that it is her belief that yours is better than ours that has led her to change her religion; it is only because she knows that immodesty is more freely practised in your country than in ours . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then turning to zoraida , while i and another of the christians held him fast by both arms , lest he should do some mad act , he said to her ,  - infamous girl , misguided maiden , whither in thy blindness and madness art thou going in the hands of these dogs , our natural enemies? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cursed be the hour when i begot thee! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cursed the luxury and indulgence in which i reared thee! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but seeing that he was not likely soon to cease i made haste to put him on shore , and thence he continued his maledictions and lamentations aloud; calling on mohammed to pray to allah to destroy us , to confound us , to make an end of us; and when , in consequence of having made sail , we could no longer hear what he said we could see what he did; how he plucked out his beard and tore his hair and lay writhing on the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but once he raised his voice to such a pitch that we were able to hear what he said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this zoraida heard , and heard with sorrow and tears , and all she could say in answer was ,  - allah grant that lela marien , who has made me become a christian , give thee comfort in thy sorrow , my father . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> allah knows that i could not do otherwise than i have done , and that these christians owe nothing to my will; for even had i wished not to accompany them , but remain at home , it would have been impossible for me , so eagerly did my soul urge me on to the accomplishment of this purpose , which i feel to be as righteous as to thee , dear father , it seems wicked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but neither could her father hear her nor we see him when she said this; and so , while i consoled zoraida , we turned our attention to our voyage , in which a breeze from the right point so favoured us that we made sure of finding ourselves off the coast of spain on the morrow by daybreak . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but , as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed , without being attended or followed by some disturbing evil that gives a shock to it , our fortune , or perhaps the curses which the moor had hurled at his daughter ( for whatever kind of father they may come from these are always to be dreaded ) , brought it about that when we were now in mid - sea , and the night about three hours spent , as we were running with all sail set and oars lashed , for the favouring breeze saved us the trouble of using them , we saw by the light of the moon , which shone brilliantly , a square - rigged vessel in full sail close to us , luffing up and standing across our course , and so close that we had to strike sail to avoid running foul of her , while they too put the helm hard up to let us pass . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we , however , finding ourselves sinking began to shout for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning to fill . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they then lay to , and lowering a skiff or boat , as many as a dozen frenchmen , well armed with match - locks , and their matches burning , got into it and came alongside; and seeing how few we were , and that our vessel was going down , they took us in , telling us that this had come to us through our incivility in not giving them an answer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> our renegade took the trunk containing zoraida s wealth and dropped it into the sea without anyone perceiving what he did . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short we went on board with the frenchmen , who , after having ascertained all they wanted to know about us , rifled us of everything we had , as if they had been our bitterest enemies , and from zoraida they took even the anklets she wore on her feet; but the distress they caused her did not distress me so much as the fear i was in that from robbing her of her rich and precious jewels they would proceed to rob her of the most precious jewel that she valued more than all . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the desires , however , of those people do not go beyond money , but of that their covetousness is insatiable , and on this occasion it was carried to such a pitch that they would have taken even the clothes we wore as captives if they had been worth anything to them . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was the advice of some of them to throw us all into the sea wrapped up in a sail; for their purpose was to trade at some of the ports of spain , giving themselves out as bretons , and if they brought us alive they would be punished as soon as the robbery was discovered; but the captain ( who was the one who had plundered my beloved zoraida ) said he was satisfied with the prize he had got , and that he would not touch at any spanish port , but pass the straits of gibraltar by night , or as best he could , and make for la rochelle , from which he had sailed . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so they agreed by common consent to give us the skiff belonging to their ship and all we required for the short voyage that remained to us , and this they did the next day on coming in sight of the spanish coast , with which , and the joy we felt , all our sufferings and miseries were as completely forgotten as if they had never been endured by us , such is the delight of recovering lost liberty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it may have been about mid - day when they placed us in the boat , giving us two kegs of water and some biscuit; and the captain , moved by i know not what compassion , as the lovely zoraida was about to embark , gave her some forty gold crowns , and would not permit his men to take from her those same garments which she has on now . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we got into the boat , returning them thanks for their kindness to us , and showing ourselves grateful rather than indignant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but as the moon did not show that night , and the sky was clouded , and as we knew not whereabouts we were , it did not seem to us a prudent thing to make for the shore , as several of us advised , saying we ought to run ourselves ashore even if it were on rocks and far from any habitation , for in this way we should be relieved from the apprehensions we naturally felt of the prowling vessels of the tetuan corsairs , who leave barbary at nightfall and are on the spanish coast by daybreak , where they commonly take some prize , and then go home to sleep in their own houses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but of the conflicting counsels the one which was adopted was that we should approach gradually , and land where we could if the sea were calm enough to permit us . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we ran our boat up on the sand , and all sprang out and kissed the ground , and with tears of joyful satisfaction returned thanks to god our lord for all his incomparable goodness to us on our voyage . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we took out of the boat the provisions it contained , and drew it up on the shore , and then climbed a long way up the mountain , for even there we could not feel easy in our hearts , or persuade ourselves that it was christian soil that was now under our feet . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the dawn came , more slowly , i think , than we could have wished; we completed the ascent in order to see if from the summit any habitation or any shepherds  huts could be discovered , but strain our eyes as we might , neither dwelling , nor human being , nor path nor road could we perceive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> however , we determined to push on farther , as it could not but be that ere long we must see some one who could tell us where we were . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but what distressed me most was to see zoraida going on foot over that rough ground; for though i once carried her on my shoulders , she was more wearied by my weariness than rested by the rest; and so she would never again allow me to undergo the exertion , and went on very patiently and cheerfully , while i led her by the hand . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we had gone rather less than a quarter of a league when the sound of a little bell fell on our ears , a clear proof that there were flocks hard by , and looking about carefully to see if any were within view , we observed a young shepherd tranquilly and unsuspiciously trimming a stick with his knife at the foot of a cork tree . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to arms , to arms! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor did our expectation deceive us , for two hours had not passed when , coming out of the brushwood into the open ground , we perceived some fifty mounted men swiftly approaching us at a hand - gallop . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - thanks be to god , sirs , for bringing us to such good quarters; for , if i do not deceive myself , the ground we stand on is that of velez malaga unless , indeed , all my years of captivity have made me unable to recollect that you , seor , who ask who we are , are pedro de bustamante , my uncle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the christian captive had hardly uttered these words , when the horseman threw himself off his horse , and ran to embrace the young man , crying: </s> </s>

<s> <s> i recognise thee now; and long have i mourned thee as dead , i , and my sister , thy mother , and all thy kin that are still alive , and whom god has been pleased to preserve that they may enjoy the happiness of seeing thee . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the whole town came out to meet us , for they had by this time heard of our arrival from one who had gone on in advance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were not astonished to see liberated captives or captive moors , for people on that coast are well used to see both one and the other; but they were astonished at the beauty of zoraida , which was just then heightened , as well by the exertion of travelling as by joy at finding herself on christian soil , and relieved of all fear of being lost; for this had brought such a glow upon her face , that unless my affection for her were deceiving me , i would venture to say that there was not a more beautiful creature in the worldat least , that i had ever seen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we went straight to the church to return thanks to god for the mercies we had received , and when zoraida entered it she said there were faces there like lela marien s . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the patience with which she endures the hardships that poverty brings with it , and the eagerness she shows to become a christian , are such that they fill me with admiration , and bind me to serve her all my life; though the happiness i feel in seeing myself hers , and her mine , is disturbed and marred by not knowing whether i shall find any corner to shelter her in my own country , or whether time and death may not have made such changes in the fortunes and lives of my father and brothers , that i shall hardly find anyone who knows me , if they are not alive . </s> </s>

<s> <s> the servant had further informed him that he was now going to the indies with the appointment of judge of the supreme court of mexico; and he had learned , likewise , that the young lady was his daughter , whose mother had died in giving birth to her , and that he was very rich in consequence of the dowry left to him with the daughter . </s> </s>

<s> <s> then they agreed that the captain and zoraida should return with his brother to seville , and send news to his father of his having been delivered and found , so as to enable him to come and be present at the marriage and baptism of zoraida , for it was impossible for the judge to put off his journey , as he was informed that in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from seville for new spain , and to miss the passage would have been a great inconvenience to him . </s> </s>

<s> <s> no one could imagine who it was that sang so sweetly , and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument . </s> </s>

<s> <s> clara awoke quite drowsy , and not understanding at the moment what dorothea said , asked her what it was; she repeated what she had said , and clara became attentive at once; but she had hardly heard two lines , as the singer continued , when a strange trembling seized her , as if she were suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague , and throwing her arms round dorothea she said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the greatest kindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so as neither to see or hear that unhappy musician . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - nay , he is the lord of many places , replied clara ,  - and that one in my heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him , unless he be willing to surrender it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl , for it seemed to be far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any promise of , so she said to her: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but do not tell me anything now; i do not want to lose the pleasure i get from listening to the singer by giving my attention to your transports , for i perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a new air . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let him , in heaven s name , returned clara; and not to hear him she stopped both ears with her hands , at which dorothea was again surprised; but turning her attention to the song she found that it ran in this fashion: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> one of the signs he used to make me was to link one hand in the other , to show me he wished to marry me; and though i should have been glad if that could be , being alone and motherless i knew not whom to open my mind to , and so i left it as it was , showing him no favour , except when my father , and his too , were from home , to raise the curtain or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly , at which he would show such delight that he seemed as if he were going mad . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - ah , seora , said dona clara ,  - what end can be hoped for when his father is of such lofty position , and so wealthy , that he would think i was not fit to be even a servant to his son , much less wife? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and as to marrying without the knowledge of my father , i would not do it for all the world . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - what then , discreet dame , is it that your mistress wants? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> replied don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> maritornes felt sure that don quixote would present the hand she had asked , and making up her mind what to do , she got down from the hole and went into the stable , where she took the halter of sancho panza s ass , and in all haste returned to the hole , just as don quixote had planted himself standing on rocinante s saddle in order to reach the grated window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving her his hand , he said ,  - lady , take this hand , or rather this scourge of the evil - doers of the earth; take , i say , this hand which no other hand of woman has ever touched , not even hers who has complete possession of my entire body . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - that we shall see presently , said maritornes , and making a running knot on the halter , she passed it over his wrist and coming down from the hole tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the straw - loft . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but there was nobody now to listen to these words of don quixote s , for as soon as maritornes had tied him she and the other made off , ready to die with laughing , leaving him fastened in such a way that it was impossible for him to release himself . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> finding himself fast , then , and that the ladies had retired , he began to fancy that all this was done by enchantment , as on the former occasion when in that same castle that enchanted moor of a carrier had belaboured him; and he cursed in his heart his own want of sense and judgment in venturing to enter the castle again , after having come off so badly the first time; it being a settled point with knights - errant that when they have tried an adventure , and have not succeeded in it , it is a sign that it is not reserved for them but for others , and that therefore they need not try it again . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could release himself , but it had been made so fast that all his efforts were in vain . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it is true he pulled it gently lest rocinante should move , but try as he might to seat himself in the saddle , he had nothing for it but to stand upright or pull his hand off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> then it was he wished for the sword of amadis , against which no enchantment whatever had any power; then he cursed his ill fortune; then he magnified the loss the world would sustain by his absence while he remained there enchanted , for that he believed he was beyond all doubt; then he once more took to thinking of his beloved dulcinea del toboso; then he called to his worthy squire sancho panza , who , buried in sleep and stretched upon the pack - saddle of his ass , was oblivious , at that moment , of the mother that bore him; then he called upon the sages lirgandeo and alquife to come to his aid; then he invoked his good friend urganda to succour him; and then , at last , morning found him in such a state of desperation and perplexity that he was bellowing like a bull , for he had no hope that day would bring any relief to his suffering , which he believed would last for ever , inasmuch as he was enchanted; and of this he was convinced by seeing that rocinante never stirred , much or little , and he felt persuaded that he and his horse were to remain in this state , without eating or drinking or sleeping , until the malign influence of the stars was overpast , or until some other more sage enchanter should disenchant him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he was very much deceived in this conclusion , for daylight had hardly begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on horseback , well equipped and accoutred , with firelocks across their saddle - bows . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn , which was still shut; on seeing which , don quixote , even there where he was , did not forget to act as sentinel , and said in a loud and imperious tone ,  - knights , or squires , or whatever ye be , ye have no right to knock at the gates of this castle; for it is plain enough that they who are within are either asleep , or else are not in the habit of throwing open the fortress until the sun s rays are spread over the whole surface of the earth . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> withdraw to a distance , and wait till it is broad daylight , and then we shall see whether it will be proper or not to open to you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> if you are the innkeeper bid them open to us; we are travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on , for we are in haste . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - do you think , gentlemen , that i look like an innkeeper? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t know what you look like , replied the other;  - but i know that you are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - a castle it is , returned don quixote ,  - nay , more , one of the best in this whole province , and it has within it people who have had the sceptre in the hand and the crown on the head . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it would be better if it were the other way , said the traveller ,  - the sceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if so , may be there is within some company of players , with whom it is a common thing to have those crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn as this , and where such silence is kept , i do not believe any people entitled to crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the comrades of the spokesman , growing weary of the dialogue with don quixote , renewed their knocks with great vehemence , so much so that the host , and not only he but everybody in the inn , awoke , and he got up to ask who knocked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it happened at this moment that one of the horses of the four who were seeking admittance went to smell rocinante , who melancholy , dejected , and with drooping ears stood motionless , supporting his sorely stretched master; and as he was , after all , flesh , though he looked as if he were made of wood , he could not help giving way and in return smelling the one who had come to offer him attentions . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but he had hardly moved at all when don quixote lost his footing; and slipping off the saddle , he would have come to the ground , but for being suspended by the arm , which caused him such agony that he believed either his wrist would be cut through or his arm torn off; and he hung so near the ground that he could just touch it with his feet , which was all the worse for him; for , finding how little was wanted to enable him to plant his feet firmly , he struggled and stretched himself as much as he could to gain a footing; just like those undergoing the torture of the strappado , when they are fixed at  - touch and no touch , who aggravate their own sufferings by their violent efforts to stretch themselves , deceived by the hope which makes them fancy that with a very little more they will reach the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so loud , in fact , were the shouts of don quixote , that the landlord opening the gate of the inn in all haste , came out in dismay , and ran to see who was uttering such cries , and those who were outside joined him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he without replying a word took the rope off his wrist , and rising to his feet leaped upon rocinante , braced his buckler on his arm , put his lance in rest , and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back at a half - gallop exclaiming: </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of don quixote; but the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was , and not to mind him as he was out of his senses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlord replied that there were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person they were inquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in which the judge had come , said ,  - he is here no doubt , for this is the coach he is following: let one of us stay at the gate , and the rest go in to look for him; or indeed it would be as well if one of us went round the inn , lest he should escape over the wall of the yard . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so be it , said another; and while two of them went in , one remained at the gate and the other made the circuit of the inn; observing all which , the landlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking all these precautions , though he understood they were looking for the youth whose description they had given him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason , as well as in consequence of the noise don quixote had made , everybody was awake and up , but particularly dona clara and dorothea; for they had been able to sleep but badly that night , the one from agitation at having her lover so near her , the other from curiosity to see him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote , when he saw that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to his challenge , was furious and ready to die with indignation and wrath; and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was lawful for a knight - errant to undertake or engage in another enterprise , when he had plighted his word and faith not to involve himself in any until he had made an end of the one to which he was pledged , he would have attacked the whole of them , and would have made them return an answer in spite of themselves . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but considering that it would not become him , nor be right , to begin any new emprise until he had established micomicona in her kingdom , he was constrained to hold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the proceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found the youth they were seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer , without a thought of anyone coming in search of him , much less finding him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the man laid hold of him by the arm , saying ,  - it becomes you well indeed , seor don luis , to be in the dress you wear , and well the bed in which i find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held him , but presently recognised him as one of his father s servants , at which he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or utter a word; while the servant went on to say ,  - there is nothing for it now , seor don luis , but to submit quietly and return home , unless it is your wish that my lord , your father , should take his departure for the other world , for nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he is in at your absence . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but how did my father know that i had gone this road and in this dress? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it was a student to whom you confided your intentions , answered the servant ,  - that disclosed them , touched with pity at the distress he saw your father suffer on missing you; he therefore despatched four of his servants in quest of you , and here we all are at your service , better pleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able to restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - what can you please or heaven order , said the other ,  - except to agree to go back? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> anything else is impossible . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at whose side don luis lay , and rising , he went to report what had taken place to don fernando , cardenio , and the others , who had by this time dressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youth as  - don , and what words had passed , and how he wanted him to return to his father , which the youth was unwilling to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> with this , and what they already knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him , they all felt very anxious to know more particularly who he was , and even to help him if it was attempted to employ force against him; so they hastened to where he was still talking and arguing with his servant . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea at this instant came out of her room , followed by dona clara all in a tremor; and calling cardenio aside , she told him in a few words the story of the musician and dona clara , and he at the same time told her what had happened , how his father s servants had come in search of him; but in telling her so , he did not speak low enough but that dona clara heard what he said , at which she was so much agitated that had not dorothea hastened to support her she would have fallen to the ground . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all the four who had come in quest of don luis had now come into the inn and surrounded him , urging him to return and console his father at once and without a moment s delay . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he replied that he could not do so on any account until he had concluded some business in which his life , honour , and heart were at stake . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - you shall not do that , replied don luis ,  - unless you take me dead; though however you take me , it will be without life . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute , but particularly cardenio , don fernando , his companions , the judge , the curate , the barber , and don quixote; for he now considered there was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - our object , said one of the four ,  - is to save the life of his father , who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman s disappearance . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> upon this don luis exclaimed ,  - there is no need to make my affairs public here; i am free , and i will return if i please; and if not , none of you shall compel me . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - reason will compel your worship , said the man ,  - and if it has no power over you , it has power over us , to make us do what we came for , and what it is our duty to do . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - let us hear what the whole affair is about , said the judge at this; but the man , who knew him as a neighbour of theirs , replied ,  - do you not know this gentleman , seor judge? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> he is the son of your neighbour , who has run away from his father s house in a dress so unbecoming his rank , as your worship may perceive . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> tears came into the eyes of the young man , and he was unable to utter a word in reply to the judge , who told the four servants not to be uneasy , for all would be satisfactorily settled; and then taking don luis by the hand , he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having come there . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to which don quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied ,  - fair damsel , at the present moment your request is inopportune , for i am debarred from involving myself in any adventure until i have brought to a happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that which i can do for you is what i will now mention: run and tell your father to stand his ground as well as he can in this battle , and on no account to allow himself to be vanquished , while i go and request permission of the princess micomicona to enable me to succour him in his distress; and if she grants it , rest assured i will relieve him from it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - sinner that i am , exclaimed maritornes , who stood by;  - before you have got your permission my master will be in the other world . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the princess granted it graciously , and he at once , bracing his buckler on his arm and drawing his sword , hastened to the inn - gate , where the two guests were still handling the landlord roughly; but as soon as he reached the spot he stopped short and stood still , though maritornes and the landlady asked him why he hesitated to help their master and husband . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i hesitate , said don quixote ,  - because it is not lawful for me to draw sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire sancho to me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus matters stood at the inn - gate , where there was a very lively exchange of fisticuffs and punches , to the sore damage of the landlord and to the wrath of maritornes , the landlady , and her daughter , who were furious when they saw the pusillanimity of don quixote , and the hard treatment their master , husband and father was undergoing . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - seor , i have no more to tell you than that from the moment when , through heaven s will and our being near neighbours , i first saw dona clara , your daughter and my lady , from that instant i made her the mistress of my will , and if yours , my true lord and father , offers no impediment , this very day she shall become my wife . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> for her i left my father s house , and for her i assumed this disguise , to follow her whithersoever she may go , as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the pole - star . </s> </s>

<s> <s> with this the love - smitten youth was silent , while the judge , after hearing him , was astonished , perplexed , and surprised , as well at the manner and intelligence with which don luis had confessed the secret of his heart , as at the position in which he found himself , not knowing what course to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected . </s> </s>

<s> <s> in the course of the altercation , among other things the barber said ,  - gentlemen , this pack - saddle is mine as surely as i owe god a death , and i know it as well as if i had given birth to it , and here is my ass in the stable who will not let me lie; only try it , and if it does not fit him like a glove , call me a rascal; and what is more , the same day i was robbed of this , they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin , never yet handselled , that would fetch a crown any day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> at this don quixote could not keep himself from answering; and interposing between the two , and separating them , he placed the pack - saddle on the ground , to lie there in sight until the truth was established , and said ,  - your worships may perceive clearly and plainly the error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin which was , is , and shall be the helmet of mambrino which i won from him in fair war , and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful possession . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - there is no doubt of that , said sancho ,  - for from the time my master won it until now he has only fought one battle in it , when he let loose those unlucky men in chains; and if had not been for this basin - helmet he would not have come off over well that time , for there was plenty of stone - throwing in that affair . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - by god , gentlemen , said don quixote ,  - so many strange things have happened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which i have sojourned in it , that i will not venture to assert anything positively in reply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my belief that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so that now , for me to come forward to give an opinion in such a puzzling matter , would be to risk a rash decision . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - there can be no question , said don fernando on this ,  - but that seor don quixote has spoken very wisely , and that with us rests the decision of this matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on , i will take the votes of the gentlemen in secret , and declare the result clearly and fully . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all laughed to see don fernando going from one to another collecting the votes , and whispering to them to give him their private opinion whether the treasure over which there had been so much fighting was a pack - saddle or a caparison; but after he had taken the votes of those who knew don quixote , he said aloud ,  - the fact is , my good fellow , that i am tired collecting such a number of opinions , for i find that there is not one of whom i ask what i desire to know , who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that this is the pack - saddle of an ass , and not the caparison of a horse , nay , of a thoroughbred horse; so you must submit , for , in spite of you and your ass , this is a caparison and no pack - saddle , and you have stated and proved your case very badly . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - may i never share heaven , said the poor barber ,  - if your worships are not all mistaken; and may my soul appear before god as that appears to me a pack - saddle and not a caparison; but , laws go , i say no more; and indeed i am not drunk , for i am fasting , except it be from sin . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the absurdities of don quixote , who now observed: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - it is all the same , said the servant;  - that is not the point; but whether it is or is not a pack - saddle , as your worships say . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the brotherhood , who had been listening to the dispute and controversy , unable to restrain his anger and impatience , exclaimed ,  - it is a pack - saddle as sure as my father is my father , and whoever has said or will say anything else must be drunk . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you lie like a rascally clown , returned don quixote; and lifting his pike , which he had never let out of his hand , he delivered such a blow at his head that , had not the officer dodged it , it would have stretched him at full length . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - hold all , let all sheathe their swords , let all be calm and attend to me as they value their lives! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all paused at his mighty voice , and he went on to say ,  - did i not tell you , sirs , that this castle was enchanted , and that a legion or so of devils dwelt in it? </s> </s>

<s> <s> come then , you , seor judge , and you , seor curate; let the one represent king agramante and the other king sobrino , and make peace among us; for by god almighty it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as we are should slay one another for such trifling cause . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlord alone insisted upon it that they must punish the insolence of this madman , who at every turn raised a disturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled for the present; the pack - saddle remained a caparison till the day of judgment , and the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in don quixote s imagination . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the judge and the curate , the servants of don luis began again to urge him to return with them at once; and while he was discussing the matter with them , the judge took counsel with don fernando , cardenio , and the curate as to what he ought to do in the case , telling them how it stood , and what don luis had said to him . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it was agreed at length that don fernando should tell the servants of don luis who he was , and that it was his desire that don luis should accompany him to andalusia , where he would receive from the marquis his brother the welcome his quality entitled him to; for , otherwise , it was easy to see from the determination of don luis that he would not return to his father at present , though they tore him to pieces . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> on learning the rank of don fernando and the resolution of don luis the four then settled it between themselves that three of them should return to tell his father how matters stood , and that the other should remain to wait upon don luis , and not leave him until they came back for him , or his father s orders were known . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> thus by the authority of agramante and the wisdom of king sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but the enemy of concord and hater of peace , feeling himself slighted and made a fool of , and seeing how little he had gained after having involved them all in such an elaborate entanglement , resolved to try his hand once more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> it came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the rank of those with whom they had been engaged , and withdrew from the contest , considering that whatever the result might be they were likely to get the worst of the battle; but one of them , the one who had been thrashed and kicked by don fernando , recollected that among some warrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents , he had one against don quixote , whom the holy brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting the galley slaves free , as sancho had , with very good reason , apprehended . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> suspecting how it was , then , he wished to satisfy himself as to whether don quixote s features corresponded; and taking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search of , and setting himself to read it deliberately , for he was not a quick reader , as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on don quixote , and went on comparing the description in the warrant with his face , and discovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the landlady , when she saw her husband engaged in a fresh quarrel , lifted up her voice afresh , and its note was immediately caught up by maritornes and her daughter , calling upon heaven and all present for help; and sancho , seeing what was going on , exclaimed ,  - by the lord , it is quite true what my master says about the enchantments of this castle , for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don fernando parted the officer and don quixote , and to their mutual contentment made them relax the grip by which they held , the one the coat collar , the other the throat of his adversary; for all this , however , the officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help , and deliver him over bound into their power , as was required for the service of the king and of the holy brotherhood , on whose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber and footpad of the highways . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> who , i say again , was the fool that knows not that there are no letters patent of nobility that confer such privileges or exemptions as a knight - errant acquires the day he is dubbed a knight , and devotes himself to the arduous calling of chivalry? </s> </s>

<s> <s> while don quixote was talking in this strain , the curate was endeavouring to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses , as they might perceive by his deeds and his words , and that they need not press the matter any further , for even if they arrested him and carried him off , they would have to release him by - and - by as a madman; to which the holder of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into don quixote s madness , but only to execute his superior s orders , and that once taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - for all that , said the curate ,  - you must not take him away this time , nor will he , it is my opinion , let himself be taken away . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in short , the curate used such arguments , and don quixote did such mad things , that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they had not perceived his want of wits , and so they thought it best to allow themselves to be pacified , and even to act as peacemakers between the barber and sancho panza , who still continued their altercation with much bitterness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> these two disputes , which were the most important and gravest , being settled , it only remained for the servants of don luis to consent that three of them should return while one was left to accompany him whither don fernando desired to take him; and good luck and better fortune , having already begun to solve difficulties and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers and warriors of the inn , were pleased to persevere and bring everything to a happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as don luis wished; which gave dona clara such happiness that no one could have looked into her face just then without seeing the joy of her heart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> zoraida , though she did not fully comprehend all she saw , was grave or gay without knowing why , as she watched and studied the various countenances , but particularly her spaniard s , whom she followed with her eyes and clung to with her soul . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the curate settled all amicably , and don fernando paid; though the judge had also very readily offered to pay the score; and all became so peaceful and quiet that the inn no longer reminded one of the discord of agramante s camp , as don quixote said , but of the peace and tranquillity of the days of octavianus: for all which it was the universal opinion that their thanks were due to the great zeal and eloquence of the curate , and to the unexampled generosity of don fernando . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> therefore , lady , let us , as i say , forestall his schemes by our activity , and let us depart at once in quest of fair fortune; for your highness is only kept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire by my delay in encountering your adversary . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it is nothing of the sort , as i am a sinner before god , said sancho ,  - but that i take it to be sure and certain that this lady , who calls herself queen of the great kingdom of micomicon , is no more so than my mother; for , if she was what she says , she would not go rubbing noses with one that is here every instant and behind every door . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> dorothea turned red at sancho s words , for the truth was that her husband don fernando had now and then , when the others were not looking , gathered from her lips some of the reward his love had earned , and sancho seeing this had considered that such freedom was more like a courtesan than a queen of a great kingdom; she , however , being unable or not caring to answer him , allowed him to proceed , and he continued ,  - this i say , seor , because , if after we have travelled roads and highways , and passed bad nights and worse days , one who is now enjoying himself in this inn is to reap the fruit of our labours , there is no need for me to be in a hurry to saddle rocinante , put the pad on the ass , or get ready the palfrey; for it will be better for us to stay quiet , and let every jade mind her spinning , and let us go to dinner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> so great was it , that in a voice inarticulate with rage , with a stammering tongue , and eyes that flashed living fire , he exclaimed ,  - rascally clown , boorish , insolent , and ignorant , ill - spoken , foul - mouthed , impudent backbiter and slanderer! </s> </s>

<s> <s> begone , show thyself no more before me under pain of my wrath; and so saying he knitted his brows , puffed out his cheeks , gazed around him , and stamped on the ground violently with his right foot , showing in every way the rage that was pent up in his heart; and at his words and furious gestures sancho was so scared and terrified that he would have been glad if the earth had opened that instant and swallowed him , and his only thought was to turn round and make his escape from the angry presence of his master . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but the ready - witted dorothea , who by this time so well understood don quixote s humour , said , to mollify his wrath ,  - be not irritated at the absurdities your good squire has uttered , sir knight of the rueful countenance , for perhaps he did not utter them without cause , and from his good sense and christian conscience it is not likely that he would bear false witness against anyone . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> we may therefore believe , without any hesitation , that since , as you say , sir knight , everything in this castle goes and is brought about by means of enchantment , sancho , i say , may possibly have seen , through this diabolical medium , what he says he saw so much to the detriment of my modesty . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - true , no doubt , said don fernando ,  - for which reason , seor don quixote , you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of your favour , sicut erat in principio , before illusions of this sort had taken away his senses . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote said he was ready to pardon him , and the curate went for sancho , who came in very humbly , and falling on his knees begged for the hand of his master , who having presented it to him and allowed him to kiss it , gave him his blessing and said ,  - now , sancho my son , thou wilt be convinced of the truth of what i have many a time told thee , that everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - so it is , i believe , said sancho ,  - except the affair of the blanket , which came to pass in reality by ordinary means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - believe it not , said don quixote ,  - for had it been so , i would have avenged thee that instant , or even now; but neither then nor now could i , nor have i seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was , and the landlord gave them a minute account of sancho s flights , at which they laughed not a little , and at which sancho would have been no less out of countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all enchantment . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> the illustrious company had now been two days in the inn; and as it seemed to them time to depart , they devised a plan so that , without giving dorothea and don fernando the trouble of going back with don quixote to his village under pretence of restoring queen micomicona , the curate and the barber might carry him away with them as they proposed , and the curate be able to take his madness in hand at home; and in pursuance of their plan they arranged with the owner of an oxcart who happened to be passing that way to carry him after this fashion . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they constructed a kind of cage with wooden bars , large enough to hold don quixote comfortably; and then don fernando and his companions , the servants of don luis , and the officers of the brotherhood , together with the landlord , by the directions and advice of the curate , covered their faces and disguised themselves , some in one way , some in another , so as to appear to don quixote quite different from the persons he had seen in the castle . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> this done , in profound silence they entered the room where he was asleep , taking his rest after the past frays , and advancing to where he was sleeping tranquilly , not dreaming of anything of the kind happening , they seized him firmly and bound him fast hand and foot , so that , when he awoke startled , he was unable to move , and could only marvel and wonder at the strange figures he saw before him; upon which he at once gave way to the idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured up before him , and took it into his head that all these shapes were phantoms of the enchanted castle , and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted as he could neither move nor help himself; precisely what the curate , the concoctor of the scheme , expected would happen . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> of all that were there sancho was the only one who was at once in his senses and in his own proper character , and he , though he was within very little of sharing his master s infirmity , did not fail to perceive who all these disguised figures were; but he did not dare to open his lips until he saw what came of this assault and capture of his master; nor did the latter utter a word , waiting to the upshot of his mishap; which was that bringing in the cage , they shut him up in it and nailed the bars so firmly that they could not be easily burst open . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> they then took him on their shoulders , and as they passed out of the room an awful voiceas much so as the barber , not he of the pack - saddle but the other , was able to make itwas heard to say ,  - o knight of the rueful countenance , let not this captivity in which thou art placed afflict thee , for this must needs be , for the more speedy accomplishment of the adventure in which thy great heart has engaged thee; the which shall be accomplished when the raging manchegan lion and the white tobosan dove shall be linked together , having first humbled their haughty necks to the gentle yoke of matrimony . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and from this marvellous union shall come forth to the light of the world brave whelps that shall rival the ravening claws of their valiant father; and this shall come to pass ere the pursuer of the flying nymph shall in his swift natural course have twice visited the starry signs . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and thou , o most noble and obedient squire that ever bore sword at side , beard on face , or nose to smell with , be not dismayed or grieved to see the flower of knight - errantry carried away thus before thy very eyes; for soon , if it so please the framer of the universe , thou shalt see thyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not know thyself , and the promises which thy good master has made thee shall not prove false; and i assure thee , on the authority of the sage mentironiana , that thy wages shall be paid thee , as thou shalt see in due season . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> follow then the footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight , for it is expedient that thou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of you; and as it is not permitted to me to say more , god be with thee; for i return to that place i wot of; and as he brought the prophecy to a close he raised his voice to a high pitch , and then lowered it to such a soft tone , that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost inclined to take what they heard seriously . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> don quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard , for he at once comprehended its meaning perfectly , and perceived it was promised to him that he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with his beloved dulcinea del toboso , from whose blessed womb should proceed the whelps , his sons , to the eternal glory of la mancha; and being thoroughly and firmly persuaded of this , he lifted up his voice , and with a deep sigh exclaimed ,  - oh thou , whoever thou art , who hast foretold me so much good , i implore of thee that on my part thou entreat that sage enchanter who takes charge of my interests , that he leave me not to perish in this captivity in which they are now carrying me away , ere i see fulfilled promises so joyful and incomparable as those which have been now made me; for , let this but come to pass , and i shall glory in the pains of my prison , find comfort in these chains wherewith they bind me , and regard this bed whereon they stretch me , not as a hard battle - field , but as a soft and happy nuptial couch; and touching the consolation of sancho panza , my squire , i rely upon his goodness and rectitude that he will not desert me in good or evil fortune; for if , by his ill luck or mine , it may not happen to be in my power to give him the island i have promised , or any equivalent for it , at least his wages shall not be lost; for in my will , which is already made , i have declared the sum that shall be paid to him , measured , not by his many faithful services , but by the means at my disposal . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands , for , being tied together , he could not kiss one; and then the apparitions lifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox - cart . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> when don quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way , he said ,  - many grave histories of knights - errant have i read; but never yet have i read , seen , or heard of their carrying off enchanted knights - errant in this fashion , or at the slow pace that these lazy , sluggish animals promise; for they always take them away through the air with marvellous swiftness , enveloped in a dark thick cloud , or on a chariot of fire , or it may be on some hippogriff or other beast of the kind; but to carry me off like this on an ox - cart! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> by god , it puzzles me! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> but perhaps the chivalry and enchantments of our day take a different course from that of those in days gone by; and it may be , too , that as i am a new knight in the world , and the first to revive the already forgotten calling of knight - adventurers , they may have newly invented other kinds of enchantments and other modes of carrying off the enchanted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> what thinkest thou of the matter , sancho my son? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i don t know what to think , answered sancho ,  - not being as well read as your worship in errant writings; but for all that i venture to say and swear that these apparitions that are about us are not quite catholic . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - catholic! </s> </s> 
<s> <s> said don quixote . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> how can they be catholic when they are all devils that have taken fantastic shapes to come and do this , and bring me to this condition? </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - by god , master , returned sancho ,  - i have touched them already; and that devil , that goes about there so busily , has firm flesh , and another property very different from what i have heard say devils have , for by all accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells; but this one smells of amber half a league off . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> sancho was here speaking of don fernando , who , like a gentleman of his rank , was very likely perfumed as sancho said . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - marvel not at that , sancho my friend , said don quixote;  - for let me tell thee devils are crafty; and even if they do carry odours about with them , they themselves have no smell , because they are spirits; or , if they have any smell , they cannot smell of anything sweet , but of something foul and fetid; and the reason is that as they carry hell with them wherever they go , and can get no ease whatever from their torments , and as a sweet smell is a thing that gives pleasure and enjoyment , it is impossible that they can smell sweet; if , then , this devil thou speakest of seems to thee to smell of amber , either thou art deceiving thyself , or he wants to deceive thee by making thee fancy he is not a devil . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in the meantime the curate had made an arrangement with the officers that they should bear them company as far as his village , he paying them so much a day . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> cardenio hung the buckler on one side of the bow of rocinante s saddle and the basin on the other , and by signs commanded sancho to mount his ass and take rocinante s bridle , and at each side of the cart he placed two officers with their muskets; but before the cart was put in motion , out came the landlady and her daughter and maritornes to bid don quixote farewell , pretending to weep with grief at his misfortune; and to them don quixote said: </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - weep not , good ladies , for all these mishaps are the lot of those who follow the profession i profess; and if these reverses did not befall me i should not esteem myself a famous knight - errant; for such things never happen to knights of little renown and fame , because nobody in the world thinks about them; to valiant knights they do , for these are envied for their virtue and valour by many princes and other knights who compass the destruction of the worthy by base means . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nevertheless , virtue is of herself so mighty , that , in spite of all the magic that zoroaster its first inventor knew , she will come victorious out of every trial , and shed her light upon the earth as the sun does upon the heavens . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> forgive me , fair ladies , if , through inadvertence , i have in aught offended you; for intentionally and wittingly i have never done so to any; and pray to god that he deliver me from this captivity to which some malevolent enchanter has consigned me; and should i find myself released therefrom , the favours that ye have bestowed upon me in this castle shall be held in memory by me , that i may acknowledge , recognise , and requite them as they deserve . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it is as you say , seor canon , said the curate;  - and for that reason those who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the more censure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the rules of art , by which they might guide themselves and become as famous in prose as the two princes of greek and latin poetry are in verse . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i myself , at any rate , said the canon ,  - was once tempted to write a book of chivalry in which all the points i have mentioned were to be observed; and if i must own the truth i have more than a hundred sheets written; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it , i showed them to persons who were fond of this kind of reading , to learned and intelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing but the pleasure of listening to nonsense , and from all i obtained flattering approval; nevertheless i proceeded no farther with it , as well because it seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my profession , as because i perceived that the fools are more numerous than the wise; and , though it is better to be praised by the wise few than applauded by the foolish many , i have no mind to submit myself to the stupid judgment of the silly public , to whom the reading of such books falls for the most part . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - but what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea of finishing it was an argument i put to myself taken from the plays that are acted now - a - days , which was in this wise: if those that are now in vogue , as well those that are pure invention as those founded on history , are , all or most of them , downright nonsense and things that have neither head nor tail , and yet the public listens to them with delight , and regards and cries them up as perfection when they are so far from it; and if the authors who write them , and the players who act them , say that this is what they must be , for the public wants this and will have nothing else; and that those that go by rule and work out a plot according to the laws of art will only find some half - dozen intelligent people to understand them , while all the rest remain blind to the merit of their composition; and that for themselves it is better to get bread from the many than praise from the few; then my book will fare the same way , after i have burnt off my eyebrows in trying to observe the principles i have spoken of , and i shall be the tailor of the corner . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  and though i have sometimes endeavoured to convince actors that they are mistaken in this notion they have adopted , and that they would attract more people , and get more credit , by producing plays in accordance with the rules of art , than by absurd ones , they are so thoroughly wedded to their own opinion that no argument or evidence can wean them from it . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - i remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows , tell me , do you not recollect that a few years ago , there were three tragedies acted in spain , written by a famous poet of these kingdoms , which were such that they filled all who heard them with admiration , delight , and interest , the ignorant as well as the wise , the masses as well as the higher orders , and brought in more money to the performers , these three alone , than thirty of the best that have been since produced?  <s> <s>  - no doubt ,  replied the actor in question , you mean the  - isabella , the  - phyllis , and the  - alexandra . </s> </s> 
 <s> <s>  - those are the ones i mean ,  said i; and see if they did not observe the principles of art , and if , by observing them , they failed to show their superiority and please all the world; so that the fault does not lie with the public that insists upon nonsense , but with those who don t know how to produce something else . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - the ingratitude revenged was not nonsense , nor was there any in  - the numantia , nor any to be found in  - the merchant lover , nor yet in  - the friendly fair foe , nor in some others that have been written by certain gifted poets , to their own fame and renown , and to the profit of those that brought them out;  some further remarks i added to these , with which , i think , i left him rather dumbfoundered , but not so satisfied or convinced that i could disabuse him of his error . </s> </s> 
<s> <s>  - you have touched upon a subject , seor canon , observed the curate here ,  - that has awakened an old enmity i have against the plays in vogue at the present day , quite as strong as that which i bear to the books of chivalry; for while the drama , according to tully , should be the mirror of human life , the model of manners , and the image of the truth , those which are presented now - a - days are mirrors of nonsense , models of folly , and images of lewdness . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or what greater absurdity can there be than putting before us an old man as a swashbuckler , a young man as a poltroon , a lackey using fine language , a page giving sage advice , a king plying as a porter , a princess who is a kitchen - maid? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> or , if the play is based on fiction and historical facts are introduced , or bits of what occurred to different people and at different times mixed up with it , all , not only without any semblance of probability , but with obvious errors that from every point of view are inexcusable? </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and even in secular plays they venture to introduce miracles without any reason or object except that they think some such miracle , or transformation as they call it , will come in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the play . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chief object well - ordered governments have in view when they permit plays to be performed in public is to entertain the people with some harmless amusement occasionally , and keep it from those evil humours which idleness is apt to engender; and that , as this may be attained by any sort of play , good or bad , there is no need to lay down laws , or bind those who write or act them to make them as they ought to be made , since , as i say , the object sought for may be secured by any sort . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> to this i would reply that the same end would be , beyond all comparison , better attained by means of good plays than by those that are not so; for after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play , the hearer will come away enlivened by the jests , instructed by the serious parts , full of admiration at the incidents , his wits sharpened by the arguments , warned by the tricks , all the wiser for the examples , inflamed against vice , and in love with virtue; for in all these ways a good play will stimulate the mind of the hearer be he ever so boorish or dull; and of all impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed with all these qualities will not entertain , satisfy , and please much more than one wanting in them , like the greater number of those which are commonly acted now - a - days . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> nor are the poets who write them to be blamed for this; for some there are among them who are perfectly well aware of their faults , and know what they ought to do; but as plays have become a salable commodity , they say , and with truth , that the actors will not buy them unless they are after this fashion; and so the poet tries to adapt himself to the requirements of the actor who is to pay him for his work . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> and that this is the truth may be seen by the countless plays that a most fertile wit of these kingdoms has written , with so much brilliancy , so much grace and gaiety , such polished versification , such choice language , such profound reflections , and in a word , so rich in eloquence and elevation of style , that he has filled the world with his fame; and yet , in consequence of his desire to suit the taste of the actors , they have not all , as some of them have , come as near perfection as they ought . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> others write plays with such heedlessness that , after they have been acted , the actors have to fly and abscond , afraid of being punished , as they often have been , for having acted something offensive to some king or other , or insulting to some noble family . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> all which evils , and many more that i say nothing of , would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person at the capital to examine all plays before they were acted , not only those produced in the capital itself , but all that were intended to be acted in spain; without whose approval , seal , and signature , no local magistracy should allow any play to be acted . </s> </s> 
<s> <s> in that case actors would take care to send their plays to the capital , and could act them in safety , and those who write them would be more careful and take more pains with their work , standing in awe of having to submit it to the strict examination of one who understood the matter; and so good plays would be produced and the objects they aim at happily attained; as well the amusement of the people , as the credit of the wits of spain , the interest and safety of the actors , and the saving of trouble in inflicting punishment on them . </s> </s>

<s> <s>  - it is all exactly as you state it , said the canon; to which don quixote returned ,  - you also went on to say that books of this kind had done me much harm , inasmuch as they had upset my senses , and shut me up in a cage , and that it would be better for me to reform and change my studies , and read other truer books which would afford more pleasure and instruction . </s> </s>

<s> <s> don quixote when he saw the strange garb of the penitents , without reflecting how often he had seen it before , took it into his head that this was a case of adventure , and that it fell to him alone as a knight - errant to engage in it; and he was all the more confirmed in this notion , by the idea that an image draped in black they had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and discourteous thieves were carrying off by force . </s> </s>
